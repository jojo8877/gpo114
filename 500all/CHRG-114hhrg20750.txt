            CALLING FOR THE GLOBAL REPEAL OF BLASPHEMY LAWS

                              ----------                              


                        THURSDAY, JULY 14, 2016

                       House of Representatives,

                 Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health,

         Global Human Rights, and International Organizations,

                     Committee on Foreign Affairs,

                            Washington, DC.

    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2 p.m., in 
room 2255 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Christopher H. 
Smith (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
    Mr. Smith. The subcommittee will come to order and, 
pursuant to notice, we are here this afternoon to mark up an 
amendment in the nature of a substitute to H. Res. 290 calling 
for the global repeal of blasphemy laws.
    Let me point out that the underlying resolution introduced 
by Congressman Joe Pitts and Sheila Jackson Lee is also co-
sponsored by Mr. Cicilline, Mr. Donovan, Mr. Meadows, and 
myself.
    Due to the strong bipartisan support for this measure, the 
fact that this subcommittee will reconvene following the markup 
for our hearing, as well as for scheduling other events, it is 
the intent of the Chairman to expedite consideration of the 
measure.
    All members have copies of the amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to H. Res. 290 before them.
    [The information referred to follows:]

    Mr. Smith. After we have concluded our expedited 
consideration, I would be glad to recognize any member, if he 
would like to say a word or two or put it in the record for on 
behalf of this resolution.
    Before I do, I would note that there is one technical 
correction that needs to be made in the first whereas clause. 
Rather than ``International Declaration of Human Rights,'' it 
should read ``Universal Declaration of Human Rights.''
    All members are given leave to insert written remarks into 
the record, if they so choose to do so.
    Seeing that with the consent of Mr. Cicilline, by way of 
his staff, we have the requisite number of members present, 
without objection, the following amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to H. Res. 290, calling for the global repeal of 
blasphemy laws, is considered read.
    The Chair moves that the item be adopted. All those in 
favor say aye.
    Those opposed, no.
    The ayes have it. In the opinion of the Chair, the item is 
adopted without objection. The measure is amended.
    As reported favorably to the full committee, the staff is 
directed to make technical and conformative changes.
    The subcommittee markup is adjourned and I thank my 
friends, both of whom have to be at other hearings, Mark 
Meadows is chairing one right now, for making time to be here, 
as well as to Mr. Donovan.
    [Whereupon, at 2:11 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

                                     

                                     

                            A P P E N D I X
