              INTERIOR IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT LEGISLATION

                              ----------                              


                      WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2015

                        House of Representatives

            Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security

                       Committee on the Judiciary

                            Washington, DC.

    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 1:03 p.m., in 
room 2141, Rayburn Office Building, the Honorable Trey Gowdy

Conyers, Smith, King, Buck, Ratcliffe, Trott, Jackson Lee, and

Dimple Shah, Counsel; Andrea Loving, Counsel; Graham Owens, 
Clerk; and (Minority) Tom Jawetz, Minority Counsel.

is the widely held belief among our fellow citizens that our 
borders are insufficiently secured and frankly border security 
is much broader than simply a negotiating item in an ongoing

    Border security is part of what defines a sovereign nation; 
the ability to control who comes and goes and provide 
assurances that national security is indeed the preeminent

off repeated statistics bears mentioning again, which is that 
around 40 percent of those who are not in the country lawfully 
originally entered through lawful means. Simply put, around 40 
percent of the undocumented population were invited here and 
overstayed their invitation. And, no fence can be designed or 
built to deal with the issue of internal se-
