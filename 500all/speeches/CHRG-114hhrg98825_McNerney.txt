    Mr. McNerney. Well, I thank the chairman for your patience and I thank the witnesses.    Mr. Mayfield, it sounds like the circuit rider is a pretty interesting job. You get to go around and see different things just about every day.    Mr. McNerney. But that is a State-funded organization? You don't get any money from the Federal Government about that?    Mr. McNerney. So they are helpful then. But this proposed legislation would help that then?    Mr. McNerney. Good.    Mr. Stewart, I get the impression that you feel the EPA is well-meaning in terms of its new regulations. It is going to make water safer and, in fact, also well meaning in terms of trying to provide assistance. But they kind of miss the mark in their intention. Is that right?    Mr. McNerney. Thank you.    Mr. Stewart, would planning and adapting to drought and other emergencies related to climate change be an acceptable technical assistance under current statute?    Mr. McNerney. All right.    And the current legislation wouldn't change that?    Mr. McNerney. OK. Good.    Mr. Mayfield, do you agree that the current statute protects you for planning for climate change or adapting to climate change?    Mr. McNerney. Thank you.    I am going to be brief here. Mr. Stewart, do you think the bill would restrict your ability to offer technical assistance in moving drinking water intakes or finding alternative source water?    Mr. McNerney. Is identifying and mitigating contamination acceptable technical assistance under current law?    Mr. McNerney. Would the new bill change that, in your opinion?    Mr. McNerney. The chairman is smiling on this.    Mr. McNerney. Well, Mr. Mayfield, you offer training to monitor for and mitigate contamination. Is that right?    Mr. McNerney. And that sounds like most of the time you are just reacting to crises. But you actually have some amount of resources to deploy in terms of training as well?    Mr. McNerney. Thank you.    Well, I think the assistance is very important. It will only become more so as climate change exacerbates the problems of our drinking water sources. So I hope we can continue to work together on these problems.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
