    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Meeting will come to order. This morning the committee will hold a hearing on the posture of the United States European Command.    First I want to recognize Mr. Visclosky for a motion.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So ordered.    Our sole witness this morning is General Philip Breedlove, United States Air Force. He is Commander of the United States European Command in NATO and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe. General Breedlove is a command pilot, a warrior who is superbly prepared to lead USEUCOM at this perilous time in history.    General Breedlove, welcome. It is a real pleasure to have you here. Thank you for your 37 years of service to our Nation.    General, I am sure that when you assumed command in the spring of 2013 you did not expect to encounter some of the political and military situations you see today. After decades of keeping the peace, EUCOM faces threats on many fronts. Your command must face down naked Russian aggression from the Black Sea to the Baltic. You must also focus your resources on supporting military intervention against the Islamic State by assisting CENTCOM to support the so-called moderate Syrian opposition and degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And to keep an eye out as well for the growing role of the Qods Force in Iran and around the world. And, may I say, I suggest keeping an eye on the issue of returning fighters.    Finally, you play a key role in assisting CENTCOM and AFRICOM with crises in the Middle East and Africa. In short, your responsibilities are not limited to the critical role you play in helping to stabilize Europe.    Last week, as you know, General, eight members of this committee traveled to Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and North Africa, including Cypress and Ukraine, in order to see the situation firsthand, meeting with our embassy people, our teams, as well as the leaderships of those countries.    In Egypt, we discussed military equipment from the United States that has been paid for but not delivered. In Cypress, we explored opportunities for the United States in that country to develop a closer mil-to-mil relationship. In Ukraine, we saw the invasion of a sovereign country by Russian military forces acting through surrogates or on their own. So we speak with you today with the benefit of seeing firsthand some of the challenges you face every day.    Of course, EUCOM has received Army, Air Force, and other assets in recent months to expand training and activities with our allies that demonstrate resolve in the face of Russian aggression. At the same time, events elsewhere, in Africa, the Middle East, have necessitated a reassessment of the allocation of U.S. forces worldwide. Notwithstanding the recently arrived troops and assets, U.S. forces allocated to EUCOM have been declining in recent years. Gone are the days of two Army corps with four divisions and two calvary regiments.    General, given the challenges your command faces, any further reduction of U.S. combat forces in EUCOM will receive very careful scrutiny from our committee.    General, we will ask you to present your summarized statement in a moment, but first may I recognize my ranking member, Mr. Visclosky, for any comments he may wish to make.                        Remarks of Mr. Visclosky    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Subcommittee will come to order. I would like to recognize the ranking member, Mr. Visclosky, for a motion.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So ordered. Thank you, Mr. Visclosky.    This morning the subcommittee will hold a closed hearing on the fiscal year 2016 budget request for the Missile Defense Agency. I say and remind everybody that the classification for this hearing is top secret, that comments must not exceed this level in this room.    Welcome back to the subcommittee, Vice Admiral James Syring--I will get the pronunciation correct this time, I apologize--director of our Missile Defense Agency. We are delighted to have you with us and look forward to hearing about the current status of your programs and your assessment of the myriad of threats facing America and our allies. Of course, the Missile Defense Agency plays a vital role in defense of our Nation. Our members consider it a priority to ensure that you have what you need to adequately conduct your mission and continue defending our Nation.    As I started my preparation for this hearing, it struck me that some things never seem to change. Almost 1 year ago to the day, the North Koreans were firing missiles and threatening to test a nuclear device. Then a couple of weeks ago, the North Koreans are again firing off missiles and making more threats.    Admiral, with events like this occurring around the globe, it only underscores the vital role your agency plays. However, one thing is very different from last year: We have the threat of sequestration looming. If we are forced to mark up our bill under the Budget Control caps, we estimate your program share of this reduction will be nearly $1 billion. We hope that you will be able to share with us this morning the impact this funding reduction would have on your program.    This year, more than ever, the subcommittee is charged with making difficult fiscal choices, and we need the best information you can possibly provide to assure that we make the best choices possible for our Nation's security. We look forward to working with you to minimize the impact of these reductions on your programs.    So welcome. We look forward to your testimony and to an informative question-and-answer session. Beyond North Korea, Iran, Russia and Chinese threats, the committee needs to hear your views on such issues as target discrimination, sensors, and directed energy research.    First I would like to turn to my good friend, Mr. Visclosky, the ranking member, for any comments he may wish to make.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Admiral Syring, the floor is yours. And your complete testimony will be put in the record.                      VADM Syring Opening Remarks    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Admiral, for your testimony.    Mr. Womack.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Ms. Granger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Before recognizing Mr. Ruppersberger, would you briefly run the committee through where we, in fact, have existing systems----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Around the world? I think it would be important. Most members know, but I think it would be good. And would you also very briefly define this issue of discrimination. You use it with a high degree of comfort.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. And maybe members know what that is, but in reality, I think it is important for people to understand what it means.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Just one comment before going to Mr. Ruppersberger on ship-based and----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Aegis Ashore.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you for giving us that picture. I probably should have done that initially.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Ruppersberger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Crenshaw.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Mr. Visclosky or Mr. Ryan. Mr. Ryan.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Would the gentleman yield?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Admiral, would you be willing to respond to Mr. Ryan? I share his concern. I think all members do. You have showed us a pretty frightening--you know, the prospects for some pretty frightening situations that could occur in the future. And I have to say, obviously, everybody will keep their mouth shut here, but in reality, somebody needs to know outside this room through some sort of an op-ed or through some general position paper that--you know, we often talk about, you know, the Chinese denying us access in the South China Sea and air access, you know, challenging our fighters and all sorts of things. But do you have some general comments about how we could as a--I won't say our committee, how Congress could do a better job of delivering some information on this that relates to some of the issues you have raised, because I think sometimes people are dismissive of our missile--this capability that we have.                                ------                                -- -- --    You cannot expect the missile defense system in the numbers that we have fielded and the numbers that we will be able to defeat a mass raid. And if that happened, we would be in a much different scenario. But we must do what we are doing to make the best use of the current interceptors, leave our option open for the future in terms of more interceptors, but the more important thing is increasing the reliability, improving the system, and adding the discrimination capability so we are assured that we can do our job on the right of launch.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Ryan.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We won't say anything.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Admiral, I think Vice-Chair Granger mentioned the Chinese and the Russians relative to their relationships with North Korea and with Iran. How would you describe, should we say, the current sharing of information between those nations and those who are developing systems? Would you characterize it that they have historically been enablers of the development of the system? And I assume some of what the Russians have shared is sort of legacy, but is there more currency in the relationship? And I am not sure what we can talk about here, even though I have cautioned everybody on the top secret. What are they actually doing? What is the relationship?                                ------                                    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I am an inveterate clipper. Most people look at their stuff online these days. Bill Gertz writes pretty well about some of your operations, and there was a pretty good definition of a new type of a threat, hypersonic missiles. I would just like to read the description for the benefit of the members, for as a layperson, this sort of said it all. Hypersonic missiles are maneuvering strike vehicles launched atop missiles that travel at speeds of up to 10 Mach, or 10 times the speed of sound. They maneuver and glide along the edge of space, making them difficult targets for missile defenses.    He goes on, current U.S. defense sensors and interceptors are designed primarily to hit ballistic missile warheads that travel in predictable flight paths from launch through space and into ground targets.    Could you talk a little bit more about this cap--this adds a dimension of huge proportions. I am not sure I totally understand everything you have done historically, but when you add this component in there as a threat, in many ways perhaps dwarfs some of the other issues we have been addressing over the years.                                ------                                    Where it is a challenge is that our homeland defense system is a mid-course intercept capability, where we intercept at hundreds of kilometers in space and are able to defeat a very predictable ballistic missile target.                                ------                                    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So short of destroying the missile sites on the ground before launch, what steps are we taking to produce--you know, to counter this new technology, these types of developments.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I assume we are doing it?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. In other words, we----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. There is a game plan?                                ------                                    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Can we assume the Russians, and I think you mentioned they are, working on a similar----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Similar program? And someone mentioned Ukraine earlier in their testimony. And I wrote an op ed, and we heard it from the President, the Russians are using, maybe not Crimea, but other portions that they have basically taken over in Ukraine as sort of a test bed for new weaponry, new cyber attacks, and all sorts of sophisticated weapons they are sort of testing out. I am sure this isn't one that they would use in that area, but what are the Russians doing?                                ------                                    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Tell me about that.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Tell me about the DF-21 ballistic missile.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Is it operational?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Do we know how many they have and----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Where they are?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. And more important, what are the countermeasures we are taking a look at?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Ruppersberger, are you ready?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Ms. Granger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Will the gentlewoman yield?    Yeah. On the directed energy, you do have money, the $30 million you have put in your budget relative to this issue here. And that is obviously an endorsement of proceeding with development. Is that correct?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. This is your piece of that----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Overall pie?    Excuse me.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. Granger.    Mr. Visclosky or Mr. Ryan?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Ryan, further questions?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Getting back to the issue of directed, Admiral, energy research, for years we invested in the airborne laser test bed program. What are we investing in now?                                ------                                    I have handed a chart out that I think would be useful to go to in terms of laser technology and mission comparison. We hear about the Army programs and the Navy programs, DARPA programs. And then, sir, since you referenced ABL shootdown, you can see in the middle of chart where that is in the terms of the range that it was done and the power level that was demonstrated.                                ------                                    Mr. Frelinghuysen. As best you can in the plainest English possible.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.                                ------                                    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So this is obviously a platform. Do you look at UAVs as a possible----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Vehicle? I mean, there is so much going on in that area.                                ------                                    Mr. Frelinghuysen. The stability of the platform, right?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You gave us a footprint of where we are in terms of, you know, Guam and Alaska. Is there a similar footprint for what China has and Russia in terms of their equivalent to the work you do, Missile Defense Agency?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We know they are working on a lot, but I am just wondering since they inherently feel we are trying to contain them, control them, you know, limit their ability to expand their areas of denial, I just wondered whether they are actually--they have something?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. The Russians? Where are the Russians?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Moving back to THAAD, there has always been historical issues in terms of tests, test schedules, like everything we do. We want to continue to test. Obviously there are people who operate who need to keep their skills up. Where do we stand relative to the test schedule, more importantly, the reliability of the THAAD program?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We are of it, but I am just saying that is an issue.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You mentioned in your response to Mr. Visclosky that, you can tell me if this is correct, we approved the sale of three batteries to the UAE? Have they been delivered?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. And you mentioned, I guess, the other countries. Are they in the queue?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yeah.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We haven't talked too much about sensors, but could you maybe talk a little bit about sensors as a--are we talking directed energy?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We talked about hypersonic, the role of sensors, and where we are in developing things that are even more highly sophisticated and technologically-based.                                ------                                    And having that umbrella coverage of radar is vital to the missile defense mission for regional and then homeland as well, sir, in terms of what I talk about with being able to keep track of and discriminate tracks from North Korea and Iran that come over the pole, and that is why our radars are placed where they are.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. And they are placed where they are, and given the uncertainty of a world where sometimes we expect the unexpected, that you feel comfortable that whatever we have here provides the degree of security that we need?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yeah.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yeah. The whole issue of--maybe I am mixing apples and oranges. The whole issue of no-notice, the ability of mobile systems, I mean, that is pretty frightening. We literally would have, you know, 30 seconds maybe to react if some system came out of a cave in North Korea, which I assume they have some degree of mobility right now.                                ------                                    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Ruppersberger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Mr. Israel.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Go right ahead.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Before yielding to Mr. Carter, that you had emphasized, and I assume it is accurate, this is co-development here.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. This is co-development, so I assume we----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. All right.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yes.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Israel.    Judge Carter, Mr. Carter.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Admiral, I want to get a little more information on what we have called the European phased adaptive approach. Is it on target? I mean, these are countries, most of whom are spending less and less on their military as part of their domestic product, and I am just wondering where we are and how we marry--you meet with your--you meet with the representatives of these countries that have these responsibilities. Are we headed in the right direction? And does it take into consideration some of the other things we have been discussing here?    I would assume the model has been a construct here, I wouldn't describe it as old school, but this approach was sort of laid out, you know, about, what, 2000 or earlier, somewhere in that area. Is it updated? Has it been updated to take into consideration some of the issues we have discussed today?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I take it--are any of the Baltic nations host to any of this? Lithuania, Estonia?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Further questions for Admiral Syring? Yes, Judge Carter and then Mr. Diaz-Balart if he is ready.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. It certainly would be viewed as North Korea is rather provocative, and it doesn't take much to provoke them, so I am sure it will be under discussion.    On behalf of the committee, Admiral--oh, Mr. Diaz-Balart, any comments?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, your presence here is so noted, and thank you for your major contribution to this discussion. I am sure we will put whatever your questions or remarks into the record for history.                                          Thursday, March 26, 2015.HON. JOHN M. McHUGH, SECRETARY, UNITED STATES ARMY GENERAL              Opening Statement of Chairman Frelinghuysen    Mr. Frelinghuysen. The Committee will come to order. As our members gather, let me call the Committee to order.    This morning the Committee will receive testimony on the posture and budget request of the United States Army. The request for fiscal year 2016 is $124.9 billion, plus $20.7 billion for the overseas contingency operations, which, by the way, I think ought to be renamed to focus on exactly what we are doing, which is pursuing terrorists around the world.    This account total includes $493 million for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund and $3.8 billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund. The President's request also includes $1.3 billion for the training and equipping of the armed forces of Iraq and the so-called moderate rebels in Syria.    This morning we will hear testimony from two superbly qualified witnesses, the Honorable John McHugh, Secretary of the Army, and General Ray Odierno, Chief of Staff of the Army. We welcome back our former colleague and recognize the fact that Secretary McHugh is doing a great job as the Army Secretary.    We are very pleased to have you back.    We also welcome back General Ray Odierno, the 38th Chief of Staff of the Army. He became Chief of Staff of the Army in September of 2011. He has nearly 40 years of service. This is his fourth appearance before the Committee.    Chief, thank you for your service and the men and women you represent.    Gentlemen, a year ago the administration was planning to reduce our force level in Afghanistan to about 5,000. On this presumption, the Army would be able to reset soldiers and equipment and ensure readiness for other potential conflicts. However, the situation has changed dramatically in Afghanistan and in Europe.    Earlier this week the President announced his intention to sustain the troop level of 10,000 into fiscal year 2016 in order to assist Afghan security forces in their efforts to defeat a resurgent Taliban.    Russia occupied Crimea after invading Ukraine and threatens its neighbors in the Baltics in Eastern Europe and, in fact, the NATO alliance itself.    In the Middle East, U.S. forces continue to fight against ISIS. While air strikes may receive most of the attention, the Army continues to provide assistance to the Iraqi security forces, even as Iran and the Quds Force lead the charge on the ground.    What a troubling brew we are witnessing.    In this situation, one might expect the U.S. Army to increase force structure in order to meet the demands of the combatant commanders. However, General Odierno, you testified before the Senate Armed Services in January that over the past 3 years Active-Duty component end strength has been cut by 80,000 and the Reserve component by 18,000, and the Army has eliminated 13 active brigade combat teams.    There are many other frightening statistics regarding the size and readiness of our Army which we look forward to discussing with you today. But if I may observe, my predecessors, both Chairman Murtha and Chairman Young, both warned of the dangers of the pendulum of spending. At a time when the Army and its sister services were flush with funding to fight concurrent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, they both predicted, and their service here was long and distinguished, that the pendulum would swing back and funding would be exceedingly scarce, and that was even before there was talk of any sequestration.    Today, with our President openly declaring that the United States is no longer on a war footing, we are seeing that the Murtha and Young predictions are becoming reality. A price has already been paid as we all assume more risk with less money.    We also need to hear about your views on several major acquisition programs. A new fighting vehicle, the Army network, the Paladin self-propelled Howitzer, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, and of course a lot of focus last year and this year on the issue of the aviation restructure. Also the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle.    Finally, gentlemen, the Committee looks forward to an update on the prevention of sexual assault in the force and the prosecution of offenders. No one, no volunteer, should ever be subject to assault, and our Committee will not tolerate it.    Mr. Secretary, General, the Committee is deeply concerned about the challenges facing the Army for both the current operations and readiness for the future. The House budget resolution passed yesterday, thank goodness, is an early step towards relief from the straitjacket of the Budget Control Act. However, in lieu of a compromise, we will be forced to produce a fiscal year 2016 bill that cuts approximately $6 billion from your request. We do not want to do that, you do not want us to do that either, but in the meantime we will ask you for a clear picture of what the Army will look like at the reduced funding level and how the Army measures up to the requirements of the National Defense Strategy.    I will be asking our witnesses for their summarized statements in a moment, but first I want to recognize my ranking member, Mr. Visclosky, for any comments he may wish to make.                        Remarks of Mr. Visclosky    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Visclosky.    The chair is very pleased to welcome the big chair, Mr. Hal Rogers from Kentucky.    Any comments you care to make, Mr. Chairman.                         Remarks of Mr. Rogers    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Chairman Rogers.    Mr. Secretary, the floor is yours. Thank you for being with us.                 Summary Statement of Secretary McHugh    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. General Odierno, the floor is yours.                  Summary Statement of General Odierno    General Odierno. Thank you, Chairman Frelinghuysen, Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Visclosky, the rest of the members of the House Appropriations Committee, thank you for you allowing us to have a very important discussion this morning.    Today we continue to experience a diverse and complex array of threats through a combination of transnational extremist organizations and nation-states, and we continue to witness an increase in the velocity of instability that was unforeseen just a few years ago.    In Iraq and Syria we continue to see the ruthless behavior of ISIL and the smoldering of sectarian conflict, which is threatening regional stability and has the potential to escalate international terrorism. Order within Yemen has fully collapsed, with the country now facing civil war. Anarchy, extremism, and terrorism running rampant in Libya and other parts of North and Central Africa. Transnational terrorist groups are exporting violence from new save havens, where they intimidate populations, prepare for future attacks, and foment instability to secure their influence.    In Europe, Russian aggression and its intervention in Ukraine challenges the resolve of both the European Union and NATO. Across the Pacific, China's military modernization efforts alarm our allies and concern our regional interests, while North Korean belligerence continues, and we continue to have ever-evolving threats against our homeland.    In my opinion, this should not be the time to divest of our military capability and capacity, but that is, in fact, what we are doing, decreasing Active Component end strength by 80,000 so far and our National Guard and Reserves by a combined 18,000. As has been mentioned before, we have deactivated 13 Active-Duty brigade combat teams and we are in the process of eliminating three Active Component combat aviation brigades. We are reducing our total aviation force by 800 aircraft, with almost 700 of those coming out of our Active Component.    We have slashed our investments in modernization by 25 percent. We have purged our much-needed infantry fighting vehicle modernization and scout helicopter development programs. And we have considerably delayed our other upgrades for many of our systems and aging platforms.    The unrelenting budget impasse has also compelled us to degrade readiness to historically low levels. Today, only 33 percent of our brigades are ready, when we believe our sustained readiness rates should be closer to 70 percent. Under our current budget, Army readiness will at best flatline over the next 3 to 4 years.    The compromises we have made to modernization and readiness, combined with reductions to our force size and capabilities, translates into increased strategic risk. We are generating just enough readiness for immediate consumption. We are not able to generate residual readiness to respond to unknown contingencies or to even reinforce ongoing operations.    This is a dangerous balancing act. We have fewer soldiers, the majority of whom are in units that are not ready, and they are manning aging equipment at a time when demand for Army forces is much higher than anticipated.    Our soldiers and leaders continue to perform superbly. Just look at how busy our Army is around the world. We have units engaged in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Jordan, Kosovo, the Korean Peninsula, and across the Afghan continent. We have rotational forces in Europe, Kuwait, and the Pacific. We are conducting a wide range of missions, from humanitarian assistance, to training and advising forces in contact, to reassuring our allies with our dedicated presence. This is the reality we face as we discuss the Army posture.    In the President's fiscal year 2016 budget submission, it recognizes these challenges. But even the President's budget represents the bare minimum needed for us to carry out our missions and execute and meet the requirements of our defense strategy.    And it is a tenuous house of cards. In order for the President's budget to work, all of our proposed reforms in pay and compensation must be approved. All of our force structure reforms must be supported, to include the Aviation Restructure Initiative. And we must be allowed to eliminate a half a billion per year of excess infrastructure that we currently have in the Army.    We potentially face a $12 billion shortfall, $6 billion in the reforms I mentioned and $6 billion in costs that really in the very near future must transition from OCO into the base. If BCA caps remain, we can no longer execute the Defense Strategic Guidance. Sequestration would compel us to reduce end strength even further, forcing out another 70,000 from the Active Component, 35,000 from the National Guard, and 10,000 from the Army Reserves. It would be necessary to cut another significant amount of aviation brigades. Modernization will be slashed further, home station training would go unfunded, and readiness rates would degrade even further.    Anything below the President's budget compromises our strategic flexibility. It worsens our readiness funding and further degrades already underfunded modernization programs. It impacts our ability to conduct simultaneous operations and shape regional security environments. It puts into question our capacity to deter and compel multiple adversaries. And if the unpredictable does happen, we will no longer have the depth to react.    We are trying our best to achieve efficiencies. We have taken advantage of our wartime reset program to reduce depot maintenance by $3.2 billion. We are reducing our reliance on contractor logistic support, which will result in nearly $2 billion in cost savings. We have identified and are avoiding costs in excess of $12 billion through the Aviation Restructure Initiative. We have reorganized our brigade combat teams throughout the force, eliminating overhead and maximizing combat capacity. We have eliminated nearly 12,000 positions by reducing all two-star and above headquarters by 25 percent. And we continue to look at ways to achieve individual and collective training efficiency.    But we must also take on acquisition reform to readdress the role of the service chiefs, of life cycle management and logistics, and of expansion of the bureaucracy and how we might eliminate that.    In response to the complexity of the future global security environment, both today and in the future, we recently published the new Army, operating concept, ``Win in a Complex World.''    We are modernizing the force and maximizing talent by opening more than 55,000 positions to women, and are assessing the potential of opening as many as 166,000 additional positions across the force.    Sexual harassment and sexual assault prevention remains our top priority. While recent reports are clear that we have made some initial progress on sexual harassment and assault prevention, we have much work to do. Our men and women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and should expect a work environment that is free of harassment, assault, and retribution. A culture of inclusion and of mutual and shared trust is essential.    I continue to be inspired by the unparalleled experience and professionalism of the men and women of the United States Army. They demonstrate unwavering dedication and commitment to the mission, to the Army, and to the Nation. We owe it to them to ensure that they have the right equipment, the best training, the appropriate family programs, health care, and compensation packages that are commensurate with their sacrifices.    The decisions that we make today and over the next several months will impact our soldiers and our Army and our Nation for the next 10 years. The burden of miscalculation and underinvestment will directly fall on the shoulders of the men and women of the United States Army that have so ably served this Nation. We simply cannot allow this to happen.    Thank you so much for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to your questions.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, General.    For the members' benefit, I am going to recognize you in order of your arrival and obviously go back and forth.    Before recognizing Mr. Calvert, General Odierno, can you give us the laydown specifically of where our troops are in Europe? A number of us just came back from Ukraine. There is a high interest in our posture in that area. We never thought we would be in this situation. Could you give us just a laydown? I know the Secretary mentioned the Baltics. We would like to know the numbers.    General Odierno. Yeah. So, Chairman, I think everybody knows we have two brigades left in Europe, an airborne brigade that is in Italy, a Stryker brigade that is operating out of Vilseck/Grafenwoehr, Germany. We also are rotating----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Just the numbers----    General Odierno. Okay.    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Of the men and women in the units, because in some areas you have 150. I assume that there is a captain or somebody.    General Odierno. So in each one of the Eastern European countries, we have a company's worth of capability there that we have been rotating through, different types of units, airborne, Stryker, and now heavy units. And there is a company, 150 people, in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Poland.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. And the numbers in Italy and Germany these days?    General Odierno. We have 20,000 soldiers in Europe total, and we are now rotating a heavy brigade of about 3,500 soldiers there that will continue to rotate that capability as we move forward.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Calvert.                         Remarks of Mr. Calvert    Mr. Frelinghuysen. General Odierno, brief response and then I am going to go to Ms. McCollum.    General Odierno. What I would just add, I think what you are getting at, and we have asked for this, there is lots of pressure on the services to reduce end strength, civilian end strength. And we do believe the fourth estate, which is what we call the rest of the Department of Defense outside of the services, absolutely needs to be looked at in terms of their growth and look at what they need to do in order to reduce the manpower, because they have increased significantly. And we have actually asked within OSD to do that. And Secretary Carter has, in fact, pledged to take a hard look at that, and I think it is very important as we move forward.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Important issue. Thank you for raising it.    Ms. McCollum, and then Mr. Womack.                        Remarks of Ms. McCollum    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Could you move the mike a little closer to your mouth, please?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yes. General, comment, then we will go to Mr. Womack.    General Odierno. Just very quickly. I mentioned in my opening statement actually half a billion dollars. So the number is about what we think it is. And, oh, by the way, these buildings tend to be the older buildings, they are inefficient in many different ways. So not only the access, they are our oldest, most inefficient buildings. Half a billion dollars could buy 5,000 soldiers a year, could provide readiness for 10 brigade combat teams. So, I mean, if we can get after this and allow us to get rid of this infrastructure, the reinvestment of these dollars could be significant.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Womack, and then Mr. Ruppersberger.                         Remarks of Mr. Womack    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you for your strong advocacy. And there are obviously some other platforms that have been not entirely successful, and I will be getting into some of those later.    Mr. Ruppersberger, then Mr. Cole.                      Remarks of Mr. Ruppersberger    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Keep moving.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You have time.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Ruppersberger.    Mr. Cole, and then Ranking Member Ms. Lowey.                          Remarks of Mr. Cole    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Are you nodding your head in agreement or what here?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Let's make sure----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Let's do it outside the building. Thank you very much.    Okay. Mrs. Lowey, and then Chairman Rogers.                         Remarks of Mrs. Lowey    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We are on the public record here, you know that.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey.    Chairman Rogers.                         Remarks of Mr. Rogers    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Israel, and then Mr. Diaz-Balart.                         Remarks of Mr. Israel    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Israel.    Mr. Diaz-Balart.                       Remarks of Mr. Diaz-Balart    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You are a full-opportunity Member of Congress.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Mr. Ryan, and then Judge Carter.                          Remarks of Mr. Ryan    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Very quickly, please.    General Odierno. So the 80,000 are in Korea, Japan, Hawaii, and then also we have some forces that are in Alaska and Fort Lewis, Washington, that are assigned to the Pacific region. As we move forward with this we will look at where we might be basing soldiers. We also have a small footprint on Guam as well.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Ryan.    Judge Carter, and then I am going to go to Mr. Crenshaw, who has been sort of graying here, you have been here so long.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I apologize for not getting to you.    Judge Carter.                         Remarks of Mr. Carter    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Go right ahead.    General Odierno. Because this idea of Task Force Smith. I have gone back and read about Task Force Smith lately, and what really--I get chills just talking about it--it is so indicative of what we are doing today, it scares me.    Thirty percent of Task Force Smith had combat veterans from World War II. All of the leadership. In fact, the battalion commander was a war hero in World War II, a Silver Star winner. And what happened was, is they didn't have the money to train the 70 percent new soldiers that they had. So when they deployed, he did everything right tactically and operationally, he put them all in the right positions, but they didn't know how to fire weapons, they didn't know how to maneuver, they didn't know how to synchronize, and so they were very quickly overrun.    And that is what we face. If we don't get the dollars, we are going to be facing something very similar to that. We are not there yet, we are not there yet, but if we continue along this path, we could be facing that 2, 3 years down the road, and I am deathly worried about that.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Judge. And required reading is ``The Coldest Winter'' by David Halberstam. If you want a wakeup call with what the judge and the general are talking about, it is a remarkable book.    Mr. Crenshaw.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. And then Ms. Kaptur.                        Remarks of Mr. Crenshaw    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Crenshaw.    Ms. Kaptur, and then Mr. Graves.                         Remarks of Ms. Kaptur    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We have a pretty good idea that they are under Suleimani and the Quds Force.    General Odierno. Yeah. So that is concerning. So that is even in addition to what I just told you.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. Kaptur.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. For the record. It may be in the course of further questions. We are going to try to get around to do some more questions. Thank you, Ms. Kaptur.    Mr. Graves.                         Remarks of Mr. Graves    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Graves.    I would like to reclaim my own time here. And in my opening remarks I focused very briefly on the Army's portion of what is now characterized as the Overseas Contingency Operation, which quite honestly ought to be renamed, because I think most Americans today, as we take a step back and sort of look with what is happening around the world, know that there is sort of a global war on terrorism. And if there is a possibility, be in my bill I plan to see that term OCO is replaced.    I would like to focus on the Army's part of that equation. You have always been joined in the fight and you spend that. Let me say, when we bring our bill to the floor, there will probably be more focus on that fund than any other aspect of the budget. And I would like to know how the Army is spending that money. And put into the equation the President's decision to keep 10,000 troops in Afghanistan. That changes the dynamic, because it is, what, a 3-1 ratio in terms of training, deployment.    I would like to know how that all fits together. Run the numbers for me, what the Army gets out of that account. Because when we go to the floor, we have to defend it, and I would like to defend an OCO budget or a war on terrorism budget that actually has something to do with fighting terrorism.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Some have already weighed in, and perhaps, General Odierno, you are going to weigh in. I note Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, by using an average cost of $1.2 million per troop per year, estimates that maintaining 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan through the end of the year, 4,300 more than planned, could result in a bill that could grow to nearly $6 billion.    Is that an accurate assessment?    General Odierno. I think so. How we do this, obviously, is we average it over the year. So I would say it is close, but it is probably a little bit less than that, because we budget for an average number of people. So it will be something less than that, but that is fairly close.    So I think we will have to take a relook at what we ask for in 2016 in terms of OCO budget requests. And we are scrubbing that now, Chairman, based on the recent decision to keep individuals there longer.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So a further breakdown of the $20.7 billion. I know, Mr. Secretary, you gave us some aspects. If you could run us through the numbers. This is the critical mass. This is where the public debate is going to focus, people saying it is being used as--a mischaracterization--as a slush fund. I would like to know where we are.    General Odierno. Sure. We have about $2 billion in retrograde and reset money in there. We have just over about $7.5 billion to support the operations inside of Afghanistan. There is another $4.5 billion for support operations, which includes our operations in Kuwait that supports Afghanistan. And, oh, by the way, it is also dollars that now are supporting the operation inside of Iraq as well and what we are doing to support that operation. And then we have about $2 billion which is general support funds that are used in order to support the operations as they continue to go forward.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Please.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I certainly don't.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I think that Members of Congress would not like that association.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. The European Reassurance Fund.    General Odierno. The Reassurance Initiative.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Part of the package.    General Odierno. That is right. That is almost about $480 million that the Army is spending. That is paying for all of our operations inside of Europe today, our ability to rotate forces, preposition equipment, build appropriate infrastructure so we can sustain that over the long-term. If we didn't have that money, we would not be able to do any of the work that we are doing in Eastern Europe.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, that begs the question, and one of your remarkable colleagues is General Breedlove, who briefed us that--I can't say he endorsed the notion--but non-NATO ally support could change the dynamic for the people of Ukraine. And I am not sure where you have weighed in on that issue, but I do think we are not talking about their possibly winning against the Russians and their capabilities, but at least giving them the resources to at least stop the advance of what apparently is a desire to basically take the whole country down.    General Odierno. And I would argue also that this is an important time to deter and compel. And so we have to start now in our ability as NATO and non-NATO nations to deter.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. But that is always something which we are pushing, a bipartisan push into the base.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We have to back up what we put in there. I can assure you, we are not going to back things up that aren't defensible.    Mr. Visclosky.                        Remarks of Mr. Visclosky    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Womack.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you very much, Mr. Womack.    Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    I want to reclaim my time here. I think this fund, which I am trying to rename, gives all of our services and our Intelligence Community the flexibility they need. I think most of us have sort of reached the conclusion that we live in a far more dangerous world, and who would have thought that we would be evacuating people out of different locations, that the Egyptians would be basically doing some things in the northern Sinai and doing some things in the vacuum that was created in Libya.    And may I say, in terms of some of the tanks that we are talking about, I think the Army has to sign off on some of the tank kits that they need to perhaps do the work they need to remain truly independent.    I would like to talk a little bit, and I say this in a very respectful way, that there is a lot of training and equipment in this account, but I think we need to be mindful that our enemies are doing a fair amount of training and equipping.    It disturbs me. I would like to sort of know from General Odierno, as we look around, ISIL, one projection was 15,000, then the agency suggested it was 30,000 operatives, a certain percentage being foreign fighters. There are training camps all over the place now in open sources identified in northern Africa, and the Quds Force is uncomfortably close to our training and equip operation.    How are we using our investments in training and equipping? Given the fact that a lot of what we are doing is being matched and perhaps overmatched by our enemies.    General Odierno. Yeah. So I think, obviously, our ability to train and equip our partners is critical and it is important for us to continue to do this.    We must be mindful of--one of the things I worry about in the future is the proliferation of technology is occurring at a much faster rate than it ever has been before. We have to understand and acknowledge that. And so, it is important for us to be more agile in our ability to help our partners in providing them capabilities that allows them to assist us in meeting common goals and objectives, wherever it might be, whether it be in the Sinai, whether it be in Iraq, whether it be in Syria, whether it be in the eastern Europe, or wherever it might be. It is important for us to understand that.    What I worry about is we see technology improvements, in ISIL, whether they now claim to have UAVs and other technology. Russia's expansion and the comment about the Arctic, six brigades are adding to the Arctic. They are being aggressive in eastern Europe. They clearly have invested and are increasing their capability. We have to be aware of this.    So we have to be able to not only continue to increase our own capability and capacity, we have to be able to more quickly help our allies and friends as we do this. I think it is important for us to be able to do that as we move forward.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. The account for which I referred to also has an element of ISR, and somebody made reference to, maybe I did to General Rodriguez talking about the vast expanse he had. Some of that is relative to no matter where it is around the world, correct me if I am wrong, relative to force protection, but some of it is relative to keeping an eye on bad people.    Tell us your feeling about where you are, your degree of comfort given the areas that our Army troops are stationed.    General Odierno. So I think as we are--we have to be constantly aware--we have soldiers all over Africa, we have soldiers obviously in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Jordan. And it is important for us to make sure that we have the systems in place that allow them to be able to see the enemy and predict the potential operations to protect ourselves. And as we reduce our size, the fact that we have 3,000 soldiers and Marines in Iraq, we have got to be able to make sure we can protect those 3,000 soldiers. Although they are not doing operations, they are training and advising, and we have to make sure that we are able to protect them, and that requires ISR and some other systems.    In Afghanistan, the same thing. As we have reduced our presence we continue to provide assistance to the Afghan security forces, it is important that we still have the intel and ISR capabilities to support their protection because they become targets. That is key wherever it might be. In Africa, it is just as important as we have soldiers all over, Africa, north, central, west and eastern part of Africa, it is important for us to ensure that we have the systems in place to provide them the protections.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Would you talk in general terms about some of those forces that there is a view that somehow we can reduce the big Army and somehow rely on, and may I say some of the bravest soldiers that ever were, courageous of our Special Forces. Often people think that somehow we can trade that off. Can you comment a little bit about their role in the general sense and how they assist in a variety of ways?    General Odierno. So as--you know, one of the great lessons--first, as we look at this uncertain world, we have to build capabilities to respond in many different ways, and part of what we learned during the last 10 or 12 years is as close to integration between conventional and special operations forces and the ability to them to work together to solve really complex problems. Whether it is training and advising in Iraq, and should we have both conventional and Special Operations Forces conducting those operations. If we ever have to expand that, we have to expand both of those at the same time. That interconnection is essential.    The same thing is going on in Afghanistan, where we have both special operations and conventional forces simultaneously conducting operations together. So this link is key. It is just never just Special Operations Forces, and they are the first ones to tell you that, that they need this support of conventional capability, enablers and combat capability for them to be successful. As we look at these diverse threats, whether it be in Eastern Europe, whether it be in Iraq, whether it be in Syria, whether it be in Africa, wherever you might choose, and place we don't know about that could pop up, it is important to have the ability to do with this with both conventional and with Special Operations Forces. So it is critical--I worry as we continue to reduce our structure if our assumptions are wrong, that we will pay a heavy price.    I worry that we get smaller and smaller, the importance of us being right becomes more important. And unfortunately, we have not had a great history of being able to predict the future. And so it is important for us to understand that as we look at these force structure reductions, are we going to be able to predict the future correctly?    Again, as I said earlier, the burden of this is going to fall on our shoulders, because we make a mistake, it will be them that go, whether they are trained or ready, they will still be asked to go. And it will cost them their lives if we have not--if we have made mistakes. So that is my deep worry. I have watched the bravery and courage of these young men and women up close and personal for 13 years and they have done everything we have ever asked them to do. We owe it to them to make sure that they get the training and systems that are necessary for them to be successful in this very complex world that we live in today.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Further questions for the Secretary? Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Visclosky and I were very pleased to sign off a new reprogramming request for the center, so we expect big things from you.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Hopefully you are working on it with all the other services.    Mr. Womack.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. And many years ago, our Army Chief attended West Point, and we recognize that, and we have superlative force, not only that comes out of West Point, but all of our service academies and all the men and women who make up our Service.    Mr. Ruppersberger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yes, of which you and I serve on the board of visitors for.                                           Tuesday, April 14, 2015.              Opening Statement of Chairman Frelinghuysen    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Good morning. The committee will come to order. This morning the committee holds an open hearing on the fiscal year 2016 budget request for the Defense Health Program.    I would like to welcome the Director of the Defense Health Agency, Lieutenant General Douglas Robb. This is your first time testifying before the subcommittee and we are looking forward to hearing how your relatively new agency is operating under your leadership.    I would also like to welcome back three Service Surgeons General, Lieutenant General Patricia Horoho of the Army, Vice Admiral Matthew Nathan of the Navy, and Lieutenant General Thomas Travis of the Air Force.    All three of you, I understand, are short-timers, and I understand this may be your last testimony before the committee, but on behalf of the committee we want to thank you for your years of dedicated service to military medicine and the Nation and wish you the best in your future endeavors. And may I say thank you for your roles over the last decades in terms of meeting the needs of our soldiers and sailors and all those airmen who have worked so hard on behalf of the work of freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world.    And I know that all of you have been intimately involved in so many cases of issues that relate to those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice, as well as those who have paid with a loss of limb, had issues of traumatic brain injury, and you have been intimately involved in all sorts of things on the battlefield, on various bases in the Middle East, and the very important element of transporting so many of these young people from both Iraq and Afghanistan through Landstuhl back here to the States for the best medical care that they could possibly receive. And on behalf of all of our committee, and I know Mr. Visclosky and all members of the committee, we are extremely grateful for the years of combined service.    I said to you before the meeting you are sort of regarded as the inseparables. And I know that you have been working very closely together. And we admire the whole issue of jointness, but joint dedicated service for that length of time we want to especially recognize this morning.    General Horoho. Thank you, sir.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. This committee has always supported robust funding for the Defense Heath Program to meet the commitment to provide the very best in medical care to the service men and women who defend our country. However, we are once again facing the looming threat of sequestration and reduced budgets. While we continually hear about negative effects on readiness and equipment modernization, we also remain concerned about any effects the declining budget may have on our world-class military health system and how it meets your quadruple aim: improved readiness, better health, better care, at lower cost.    Additionally, as has been the case for the last decade, the Department faces a challenge from the growing cost and long-term sustainability of the military health system. The fiscal year 2016 budget request for the system is approximately $47.8 billion, nearly 10 percent of the entire defense budget request, and includes the entire Defense Health Program and costs related to military health personnel, medical accrual, and military construction, the latter of which is not included under the jurisdiction of this committee, but we are absolutely keenly interested in that aspect.    Once again the budget request assumes savings associated with several controversial TRICARE proposals, propositions that have been rejected by Congress for at least the past 3 years. As a result, this Appropriations subcommittee has had to add hundreds of millions of dollars to cover the assumed savings. We are interested to hear how these proposals may have been improved from the rejected proposals to garner increased support.    Our committee also remains very concerned about the progress on the electronic health records and issues of interoperability between the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs systems. The optics on this matter continue to bother all of us, as 8 years ago we started investing in what we thought was a seamless system. It seems we are far from it.    I understand that headway has been made in sharing records in the legacy electronic systems of both of these departments and that the Department of Defense is currently reviewing some expensive, to my mind, some very expensive proposals for their future system. While it is encouraging to see that we have seen some improvement, it is imperative that the goal of genuine interoperability between the departments is not forgotten, as Congress fully mandated full interoperability and our committee has provided significant funding so that it would be accomplished.    Whatever the national focus on problems facing the VA, of course, we hope we never hear the sort of problems they have that relate to our system.    So welcome. We look forward to your testimony and to an informative question-and-answer period.    Now, before we hear your testimony, I would like to turn to my ranking member, Mr. Visclosky, for any comments he may wish to make.                Ranking Member Visclosky Opening Remarks    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Visclosky.    General Robb, front and center. Good morning. Welcome.    General Robb. Thank you very much. Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear here today. I am pleased to represent the Defense Health Agency and present its request for funding of the medical programs for fiscal year 2016.    On 1 October 2013, the Department established our Nation's newest combat support agency, the Defense Health Agency. I am proud to be its first director.    Our responsibilities are clear: to support the Service Surgeons General and our combatant commanders in the execution of their missions. Much like the Defense Logistics Agency or the Defense Information Services Agency, our responsibility is to offer joint, integrated solutions to the military departments where they make sense and where it provides value.    By building a management structure with an enterprise focus, the Defense Health Agency is helping to ensure a medically ready force and a ready medical force, and we are already seeing results. We have used a rigorous and a repeatable business case analysis and a business process reengineering to improve how we as a military health system deliver services. We have successfully established 10 shared services and achieved $236 million in savings in just our first year of operation.    The budget the Department is proposing for 2016 reflects the improved business processes that the military health system leadership team, led by the Surgeons General and Dr. Woodson, has introduced. The Department of Defense is requesting approximately $32.2 billion for the Defense Health Program. Compared to last year's budget, this request represents an increase of less than 1 percent.    This budget supports the core values of our military health system strategy: improved readiness, better health, better care, and a responsible financial stewardship. As one component of this last aim, the Department has again proposed a series of modest efforts to rebalance the health cost shares borne by the government and the beneficiaries we serve. These proposals ensure the Department will continue to provide one of the most comprehensive health benefits offered in this country.    I want to briefly mention the combined threats faced by sequestration. The Department's commitment to quality of care is sacrosanct. In the event of sequestration, we will not allow quality to suffer or place any patient at risk, period. But there are significant negative long-term effects on the overall military health system that can undermine our means to support readiness.    We understand the Department of Defense must do its part in addressing the Nation's budget concerns. However, it must be done in a responsible and a judicious manner. The Defense Health Agency is part of that solution and will achieve these ends through a responsible management approach.    I am honored to represent the men and women of the Defense Health Agency, and I look forward to the questions that you may have.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you very much, General Robb.    General Horoho, good morning. Thank you for being with us.    General Horoho. Good morning, sir. Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to tell the Army Medicine story. On behalf of the dedicated soldiers, civilians that make up Army Medicine, I extend our appreciation to Congress for your faithful support.    I want to start by acknowledging America's sons and daughters who are in harm's way. Over 141,000 soldiers are deployed or forward stationed. Army Medicine has nearly 2,500 civilians and soldiers deployed around the globe.    This has been a year of unprecedented challenges and accomplishments. Army Medicine trained every soldier deploying to West Africa to ensure their safety. Medical research teams from Medical Research and Material Command (MRMC) serving with our interagency partners spearheaded Ebola efforts on the ground in Liberia and in the lab by developing groundbreaking vaccines. Our U.S. treatment facilities were certified as Ebola treatment facilities by the CDC. We made tremendous strides in transformation to a system for health on our journey to high reliable organization, a model for safety and healthcare delivery.    Our soldiers' health readiness remains our number one priority. We added combat power back to the force by reducing the number of soldiers who were not available due to health reasons. We also significantly increased medical and dental readiness. We are enhancing health readiness by weaving the performance triad into the DNA of our Army. The MHS review validated our pathway to improve safety and quality care for our soldiers, family members, and retirees. The review showed we are either above or comparable to the best healthcare systems in our Nation.    The latest U.S. News & World Report Best Graduate School rankings validate using our bricks-and-mortar military treatment facilities as training platforms for our clinicians and administrators. Our certified nurse anesthetist program is number 1 in the Nation, our physical therapy program is number 5 in the Nation, our Baylor program for administration is number 7 in the Nation, and our physician assistant program is number 11 in the Nation.    Our programs and initiatives that contribute to our success are further outlined in our written testimony. I would like to take the balance of my time to discuss two major threats facing Army Medicine today.    An ever-changing security environment demands that Army Medicine vigilantly maintain a medically ready force and a ready medical force. The first threat is viewing Army Medicine through the lens of a civilian healthcare system. We are so much more than that. We are national leaders in medicine, dentistry, research, education, training, and public health. These are all intimately linked to soldiers' and our providers' deployment readiness. Our hospitals are our health readiness platforms. This crucial link to readiness sets us apart from the civilian healthcare system.    Army Medicine provided the majority of the operational medicine and combat casualty care in Iraq and Afghanistan that led to a 91 percent survivability rate for our wounded servicemembers. The NATO Medical Center of Excellence adopted our key areas from our 2011 Health Service Support Assessment as best practices and lessons learned.    These invaluable battlefield experience permeate our education and training platforms at Uniformed Service University, AMEDD Center and School, the Medical Education Training Center, and in our medical centers. Any radical departure from our combat-tested system would degrade readiness in an environment where the next deployment could be tomorrow.    The second threat to Army Medicine is the return of sequestration. Sequestration would have a significant detrimental impact on our patients, our families, and our medical team. Devastating reductions to both civilian personnel and military end strength would impact every Army Medicine program. Sequestration would cause the MEDCOM to close in-patient and ambulatory surgical centers and a number of our military treatment facilities, jeopardizing our ready and deployable medical force. Reductions driven by sequestration would be devastating and very different than our current rightsizing to correctly align our medical capabilities.    Our valued civilian employees were extremely sensitive to the furloughs and the hiring freeze in 2013. Two years later, we still have not been able to replace all of these highly skilled employees.    Servicemembers go into battle confident because Army Medicine, in concert with our sister Services, goes with them. For the past 13 years, when wounded servicemembers on the battlefield heard the rotors of a medevac helicopter, they believed they were going to survive. We must protect that system that gave them that confidence.    I want to thank my partners in DOD, the VA, and my colleagues here on the panel, and Congress for your continued support. The Army Medicine team is proudly serving to heal and very honored to serve. Thank you.    VADM Nathan Opening Statement    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, General, for your testimony.    Admiral Nathan.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Wow.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Admiral.    General Travis.    General Travis. Yes, sir.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Welcome again.    General Travis. Good morning. Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, distinguished members of this subcommittee, thanks again for inviting us to appear before you today, the last time together, I might add, and that is a meaningful moment for us.    Since 9/11, the Air Force has accomplished over 200,000 patient movements in our Aerovac system, including 12,000 critical care patients. The very high, unprecedented survival rate for U.S. casualties once they enter the theater medical system is a reflection of our combined commitment to the highest quality care of our patients.    Critical care transport teams were developed by the Air Force in the late 1990s and have become the international benchmark for safe ICU-level patient movement, dramatically changing how military operates in a deployed setting. We have adapted that capability to meet the Joint Staff requirements for intratheater and route tactical critical care transport of fresh, perhaps underresuscitated or post-operative ICU-level casualties via rotary and tactical aircraft, many from point of injury.    Our medical response teams include rapid deployable modular and scalable field hospitals that provide immediate care within minutes of arrival. The expeditionary medical support health response teams, which is an evolution of our combat proven EMEDS teams, are now being deployed across our Air Force. They provide immediate emergency care within minutes, surgery and intensive critical care within 6 hours, and full ICU capability within 12 hours of arrival.    Because of our experience with EMEDS in support of Operation United Assistance in Liberia, an Air Force medical team quickly deployed and set up the first healthcare worker Ebola virus disease treatment center utilized by the U.S. Public Health Service.    Our medical forces, as my partners have said, must stay ready through their roles in patient-centered, full tempo healthcare services that ensure competency, currency, and satisfaction of practice while fostering innovation. We can't separate care at home from readiness, as what we do and how we practice at home translates into the care we provide when we deploy, and we have proven we do it well.    In addition, for well over a decade we have had a cadre of our best physicians, nurses, and technicians embedded in world-class Centers for Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness Skills facilities, such as the University of Maryland's Baltimore Shock Trauma, University of Cincinnati, and St. Louis University, in order to train trauma and critical care transport teams before they deploy.    We are now committed to expanding training opportunities for nonsurgical and trauma-related skills to ensure all of our personnel remain ready and current, providing hands-on patient care of greater volume and complexity than we normally see in our facilities. Our first course was recently held at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, in cooperation with University Medical Center in Las Vegas, with more than a dozen classes to follow in 2015. This will further expand the system we have in place to identify training requirements and track completion of training events down to the individual.    I leave the Air Force in June after 39 years. In the Air Force I grew up in, the operators were primarily pilots and navigators. There are many more types of operators these days, as air power is projected through the various domains in very new ways.    Air Force Medicine is adapting and innovating to better support the airmen who safeguard this country 24/7, 365 days a year. In that regard, Air Force Medicine is now focusing on human performance. Our AFMS strategy embraces this, and to focus on this as a priority we recently changed our vision to state our supported population is the healthiest and highest-performing segment of the Nation by 2025. This vision is focused on health rather than health care and is connected to the imperative to assure optimum performance of these exquisitely skilled airmen. We have begun either embedding or dedicating medics to directly support missions such as special operations, remotely piloted aircraft, intel, or other high-stress career fields, and we have had a clearly positive impact on these airmen, their mission effectiveness, and their families.    Patient safety and quality care are foundational to supporting our beneficiaries in their quest for better health and improved performance. In order to improve safety and quality, we are committed as part of the military health system to the high reliability healthcare journey, adopting safety culture and practices similar to other high reliability sectors, such as aviation, something with which we are very familiar.    This is a journey being undertaken by healthcare systems across the Nation. The AFMS joins with our Navy and Army partners as we transform into a fully integrated system that consistently delivers quality health care while improving the health and readiness of our force.    With our vision of health and performance in mind, we are committed to providing the most effective prevention and best possible care to a rapidly changing Air Force, both at home and deployed. I am confident that we are on course to ensure medically fit forces, provide the best expeditionary medics on the planet, and improve the health of all we serve to meet our Nation's needs.    Thank you again for your strong support of Air Force Medicine and for the opportunity to provide further information today.    Remarks of Chairman Frelinghuysen    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, General.    And before I yield to Mr. Carter, who was first in the committee hearing, this may not be politically correct, but I am in awe of the men and women that work for you and have worked for you for decades, from the battlefield, when they are a special operations unit, where every person in that unit has some degree of medical training, they could look after their brothers, to the transport issue, the things that you have done are incredible.    I was at Bethesda yesterday, and the patient count is down, but the lives you put back together, and I think the committee recognizes this, for some of these young people and not so young, whether it is physical or mental, the things that you do collectively we are hugely appreciative of. I know we are the resource committee, but we are also very thankful for the things that we have invested in that you have done some remarkable things with.    General Carter--or General Carter, yes. You are the general from Fort Hood.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Judge Carter.    Mr. Israel, and then Mr. Calvert.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Israel.    Mr. Calvert.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. McCollum. Excellent line of questioning.    Mr. Crenshaw.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Sounds like General Robb is front and center on that.    General Robb. I have got that one, yes, sir.    You are absolutely right. Currently our pharmacy, 0.5 percent of our pharmacy prescriptions now account for, and that is because of compounding, compounding now accounts for 20 percent of our total expenditures in the pharmacy arena. And, again, you were correct, in March of 2014, the compounding cost us about $42 million in that month. It is $330 million in March of 2015.    So to answer your question, why is this, it is really primarily for two reasons. One, it has been a direct and an intensive marketing campaign by those compounding pharmaceuticals, not only directed towards our patients, but our healthcare facilities, both direct care and also in the network, and our providers. And so they have been actively recruiting folks to go out there and get folks to basically switch over to compounding pharmaceuticals as opposed to what we would call the more traditional. That is number one. So that is intense marketing.    Number two is in December of 2012, an average compounding pharmaceutical was about $190 per claim. December of 2014, $2,600 per script, claim. And so that tells you that the price has gone up, the marketing has gone up, and therefore that has driven the volume up.    We started to notice this about 2 years ago, because our pharmaceutical ability to identify the products in our claims, that was a new addition, and so we started to notice that there were products within the compounding pharmacy that were not FDA approved. And so our plan was to, how do we best approach this? And so we have been working together with our constituents, we have been working together with our industry, we have been working together with our beneficiaries, and also our providers to come up with a way ahead.    Express Scripts, which covers about 70 percent of the pharmacy contracts in the Nation, is also the pharmacy contract for the Department of Defense, and they have in place for the civilian sector a series of algorithms where they screen the drugs that come in for FDA compliance and also for safety and efficacy. And the number one priority of the Department of Defense is the safety and efficacy for our patients. So that is one, and then number two is to be good stewards of our taxpayers' dollars.    So beginning 1 May, we will start to screen those drugs with all the input that we have had from the different focus groups, and that is going to be immediately. Takes 5 seconds. And then if we identify a product within those compounding pharmacies that is not FDA approved, we have the ability to go back and ask the pharmacy or the provider if he wants to change the ingredient or change to a different medication. If he does not, there is also going to be a policy in place where they can request an exception to policy, and that will take about 5 days.    Before this, and we have already begun this, is an intensive campaign to communicate to our beneficiaries and to our providers out there in our managed care support contracts that this is the way ahead.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Crenshaw.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yes, sir.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Just for the record, we have been aware of this for 2 years. General Robb, you are in charge of the cost curve.    General Robb. Right.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So it is not new. And just for the record, I always thought compounding existed when traditional generic or traditional drugs weren't meeting the needs of the patients, that is why you did compounding. Is that correct? Or is this another version of compounding, just for the record here?    General Robb. You are right.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. In other words, there are traditional drugs that you get.    General Robb. Traditional pills and----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. But then when you can't meet the patient's needs, then you go into a compound mode, right?    General Robb. Right. Some of it is for ease of delivery. Most of it is for pain. But we have known about the compounding pharmacy for 2 years, but the actual astronomical growth in the cost has really only been over the last 4 to 5 months.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay.    General Robb. And then I would like to add one real quick thing on ESI. One of the things that they are currently doing that will also help not only screen it for, again, approved medications, but number two is they are now currently negotiating cost caps for the medications, and so we will bring the competition and the price down with the pharmaceuticals.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay. I just wanted to get to Mr. Visclosky. I apologize for jumping in here, but I think we need a little bit of clarification. Thank you.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Judge Carter.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Carter.    Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Consider it done.    Ms. Granger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. Granger.    Mr. Ruppersberger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I want to put in a plug for those who do the search and rescue at C-STARS too.    General Travis. Yes, sir.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. They do some pretty remarkable, courageous things.    Mr. Womack.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. For the record, could you break down the acronym you referred to? I am searching for it up here, but it has obviously done some remarkable things.    General Horoho. It is AFIRM, Armed Forces Medical Research----    General Robb. Institute of Regenerative----    General Horoho. Medicine. Thank you.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you very much.    General Horoho. Thank you. It takes a team to get an acronym.    General Travis. Sir, just a comment, if you don't mind.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yes, sir.    General Travis. Sequestration is a threat to research dollars. You know, we try to protect health care as best we can in our facilities. You don't want to close your doors, because if they don't come to see us for their health care, they go downtown to TRICARE, to the network, and that costs DoD still money.    So with sequestration pressures, things like restoration and modernization, sustainment of our facilities, and research dollars take a hit. And not just the organic research dollars for the military medical community, but also, frankly, some of our partner institutions were impacted by sequestration last time.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. General, I can assure you that everybody on this panel hates sequestration, and we firmly agree with you it is a straitjacket we would like to get out of sooner rather than later. But we are under the Budget Control Act, the President signed it into law. So we will try to extricate ourselves in a way that does minimum amount of harm to the important work you do.    Mr. Ryan.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I want to get to Mr. Diaz-Balart just before he has a conflict. But I do want to get----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Certainly not. No one is more important than you as a Buckeye.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. There will be a response, Mr. Ryan. There is a program, requirements that Congress has directed that certain things be done.    And you are going to be more specific in response at the next round of questioning.    Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We will call you out any time, but let's get moving here.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay. I didn't know you were leaving.    Ms. Kaptur.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay. Let's get Ms. Kaptur first and then we will get to others.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. We are going to have another round in a few minutes here.    Mr. Aderholt, thanks for your patience.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Let's hope we have a complaint line. If we don't, we should establish one immediately. I am sure we do.    General Horoho. We do.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Aderholt.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Would the gentleman yield?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We don't have a response. Who is grandfathered in?    General Robb. I would have to get back to you on that.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay. Does anyone on the panel know that?    General Horoho. My assumption, and we will make sure that it is accurate, is that those that have it today would be grandfathered in, and then it would be the new population that would age into it.    General Robb. Yeah. But I want to make sure we have that.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    To General Robb, we have talked about one of the main cost drivers, which is pharmaceuticals. What are two other cost drivers?    General Robb. For the military healthcare system?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yeah. Absolutely, yeah.    General Robb. Well, pharmacy is the big one, absolutely. And I think the other large areas are the execution of our direct care system, in other words, our direct health care----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, let me help you out a little bit here. In your testimony here you say the fiscal year 2016 Department of Defense is requesting $32.2 billion for the Defense Health Program. Of this request, nearly $24 billion will support direct patient care activities in our military hospitals and clinics, as well as care purchased from our other civilian sector partners. Surely that is one of the cost drivers.    General Robb. Yes, sir.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Could you talk to the committee about why that is a cost driver and how we are going to lower the cost curve?    General Robb. Well, that is precisely. So we are in the healthcare delivery business, and the direct care system, which is our brick and mortar, along with our TRICARE health network are two primary expenditures in the delivery of health care.    So as far as the TRICARE bill, as you know, we have put out a proposal for what we call the next-generation TRICARE contract, and many of the lines of effort in that new proposal will address continued cost containment in the TRICARE network. Some of the advances that we are looking at for our new managed support care contracts, number one is going from three regions to two, which should decrease the overhead, but it will also make it easier for us to transition from region to region. Another area that we are looking at----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Maybe a few more specifics here. I do want to ask about the viability of our military hospitals and clinics, but I am interested in the dollar figures that we purchase from civilian sector partners. Do we have any figures here?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yeah. And actually how do we know, for instance, that the money is well spent? I assume that we have the quality of care in our facilities, which I will ask about specifically.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. But how do we know and judge where 50 percent of the people go?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So how would you judge, since I know you do a remarkable job, all three of you do, how would you judge the track record of some of these facilities where we make substantial investments?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So it is not only a question of visibility, there is a question of cost. And I am trying to nail just for the committee here, besides the high spike in pharmaceuticals, is this one of the areas where----    General Travis. Yes, sir.    Mr. Frelinghuysen . There is some uncertainty as to----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . What the bills would be?    General Travis. We are pledged to total transparency on our costs and the quality of our care. And the MHS review, frankly, was a real positive energy source for that.    On the other hand, with the folks that go outside, and as Admiral Nathan said, it is a higher percentage go outside in certainly some of our networks for that care, and one is they may or may not participate in the voluntary reporting that we participate in where you can see the quality of the care you provide.    And the same pressures that have raised healthcare costs across the Nation certainly impact our networks. So the next TRICARE contract, the MHS review and the opportunity to have visibility into cost and quality and safety, that is part of this discussion.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So the aspect that is sort of escaping here is that we don't have a dollar amount, or do we have a dollar amount, for what we do on the civilian side for the very people that all of us are----    General Robb. Yes, we do.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. What is the dollar amount?    General Robb. I can get that, the exact number for you.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yeah, I would be happy to yield to the Congresswoman.    Mr. Chair, as part of the contract, we should be able to ask for that information, because many States are starting to provide that now. And I think you have a great line of questioning there.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, let me say just for the record, in your operations and maintenance portion in your budget, price and program, I see a private sector care amount of, it says $14 billion? $14 billion. Does that strike a bell here, or is that an accurate figure?    General Horoho. Yes, sir. And I think it has been between 14 to 16.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I am not only concerned about the figure. I am concerned about whether, to you, whether the care that our good people get, our men and women in the military, are you satisfied with care you are getting for that type of investment?    General Horoho. Sir, if I could just comment a couple things. I will put it a big picture, maybe bring it down.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yeah.    General Horoho. So when we did the MHS review, one of the challenges when we were trying to compare ourselves to the civilian sector was to have transparency of data. So when we looked in the area of perinatal care, only 84 hospitals out of 5,000 in the U.S. actually share their data, and those are the 84 hospitals across the U.S. that want to be the leaders in OB and perinatal care. Then when we looked through the lens of surgical care, less than 10 percent of the facilities in the United States that actually provide surgical care provide their data.    So there isn't transparency of data within the U.S. system except for certain States that have made a decision that that data is there. So when we look at quality and safety, we are not comparing apples to oranges. When we look at, there are places, TRICARE in itself, when they just had the survey of the top healthcare plans in the Nation, TRICARE actually was the number one healthcare plan in the Nation, that just came out of the report, and the second one was Kaiser Permanente.    So I think when we look at our servicemembers or family members going into the civilian sector to these pre-approved places, we believe there is a certain level of care, but you can't validate that through. When you look at it for cost, that is a different issue.    When we look at any patient--I will give the best example--when a patient goes out into the civilian sector for physical therapy, they on average get about between 20 to 24 visits. When we look at the same injury and the same type of care that is provided within our military treatment facilities, it is seven to eight visits. So you look at the additional cost of those visits. And I think that is what multiplies the cost of care in the civilian sector.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. But you would have to take it as a layperson to say that if you have 24 visits, it must be related to the person's disability or condition, and certainly 24 visits would be better than maybe seven or eight.    General Horoho. But not when you look at health outcomes.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay.    General Horoho. And that is the most important thing, not the episode of care.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Let's look at health outcomes.    General Horoho. Yes, sir.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Can you tell me, of the 56 hospitals, the 359 medical clinics, the dental clinics that we have, what are the outcomes there? I have an interest. I am sure members do. I know our civilian hospitals are rated. How are our hospitals rated?    General Horoho. Sure.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Anecdotally, of course, from time to time we hear of issues, i.e., you certainly don't want to have a baby delivered where they only deliver 90 babies a year. It might be good to go to a place where they have several thousand.    Is there a rating system for our hospitals, and where do we stand, if there is a rating system, in terms of similar systems for the civilians?    General Travis. The reporting that General Horoho indicated are exactly what we did the deep dive on last year to where we know the quality of our facilities where we do OB and perinatal care, where we do surgery and what the outcomes are.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So how are we doing?    General Travis. Overall we are doing very well.    General Horoho. Very good.    General Robb. Very well.    General Horoho. So if I could just kind of, sir, put it in perspective. What we compared, and I talked about the 84 hospitals, so that is the best of the best, our military treatment facilities were, when the Secretary of Defense used the word ``average,'' it wasn't average in the sense that we think of average, we were average of the best of the best. And then there were some areas where we exceeded the national rankings and there were some areas where we had outliers. That doesn't mean that it was poor quality or lack of safe care, it means that we were not in that band of the very best of the best.    And we all have plans that we have been working. Every single one of our facilities are accredited by the Joint Commission, there isn't one that isn't accredited, and we have met many of the outcome measures that we have identified. And those that we want to continue improving, because we believe for continual improvement, we have got those plans and we are monitoring each of those very, very closely.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yeah. We are on your side.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Because the NDIA has sort of changed the whole----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Scope of our review and leadership around here. I just want to make sure that we are getting the best bang for the buck.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, I don't mean to mix apples and oranges here, but in reality the private sector in some ways is way ahead on the electronic medical records, far ahead apparently than perhaps what we anticipated the relationship between the VA and the Department of Defense. Sometimes I think I know where I am going.    Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Visclosky.    Ms. Granger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Whoa.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Would the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. On our committee, we subscribe to the notion full steam ahead. We don't like to hear about pauses.    General Robb. Right.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. The committee has been making this investment since I think 2007 or 2008. I think it is, quite honestly, a little bit inexcusable that we are still mucking around here trying to get this right. Chris Miller gave Ranking Member Visclosky and I a very upbeat view of the Department of Defense effort, and I want to give credit to the things that have been done.    But the whole notion that--these words may come back to haunt you here--a virtual wind tunnel, there will be a whirlwind of hurt unless we get some progress here. And we will build into this bill, the same we way we did last year, some sort of language to push this ahead here.    Now, the VA system may be archaic, because they have all these hospitals with whole different legacy systems, but we have a more optimistic view of what you can do, and so we are counting on you. And I think in Ms. Granger's questions, if she will continue to yield, was a more specific question about what this whole thing is going to cost and the timetable. I know you talked about lower costs. Let's talk about what you consider to be the lower costs for the next couple of years.    So is it $11 billion, $9 billion, $13 billion? This committee is interested in how all that money is going to be spent, but we would like to get sort of a general idea of the entire cost of this whole thing. I mean, just for you.    General Robb. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. The entire cost for the total life cycle, and that is when you hear the $30 billion number, is through the entire life cycle that runs through fiscal year 2032, fiscal year 2032. So in other words, that includes the sustainment, that includes the sustainment.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, fiscal year 2032.    General Robb. 2032. In other words, when you look at the cost of the electronic health record, which includes the interagency cost for both the DoD and the VA.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. On this committee, we are interested in 2017.    General Robb. Right.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I thought that was going to be the goalpost here. I am a little bit concerned. Where do we get 2032? We will all be dead and buried.    General Robb. Well, no. The question was asked what is the total life cycle cost of the electronic health record and that was the number I gave you. In other words, the program sustainment of this acquiring of the new electronic health record is through fiscal year 2032.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. All right.    Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. McCollum. Good line of questioning.    Mr. Ryan.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You took a dig at Navy chow.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Admiral was sucking it in there for a few minutes.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. No equal time here, I guess.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yeah. This is on the record, and God only knows you have done irreparable damage to Mr. Visclosky's reputation.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Ryan. You got your time. You reclaimed some good time, though, didn't you?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Ruppersberger, Ms. Kaptur, any additional comments?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Ruppersberger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Let me assure the gentleman, if he will yield, that there is a keen interest in the congressionally directed funding. I think there is some concern as to whether the new Defense Health Agency, I won't say the chain of command, because you represent the top of the heap in some regards, want to make sure that we continue that funding stream for these very important investments and not get choked down by too much extra bureaucracy. So I could assure you we will be addressing this issue and other congressional adds as appropriate.    Ms. Kaptur.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. If the gentlelady will yield. This is to address the needs of an estimated 9.2 million beneficiaries that are in this system?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Families too?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you. Thank you for the time.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. If you can provide that for the record.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. Kaptur.    In closing, we haven't alluded to it, in January the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission released their recommendations. I assume you are intimately familiar with some of those recommendations. And I guess this is directed towards the Surgeons General who are here. And you have had remarkable careers and dedication and done some incredible things on behalf of our soldiers and sailors and airmen.    One of those recommendations is the Joint Readiness Command billet. I know that you have a chain of command, but since you have done some incredible things for our Nation, what is your view of that recommendation? What are you at liberty to say relative to that recommendation from this rather distinguished group?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, you have been remarkable stewards of all those who serve our Nation in uniform, all those who volunteer. And your concerns and your voice and your opinions matter. I want you to know that the committee feels very strongly that your opinions do matter. And I hope that this isn't the last of your offering your good opinions and professional judgments into the process.    Anything further, Mr. Visclosky, before we conclude?                                         Wednesday, April 15, 2015.HON. JAMES McGOVERN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF               Opening Statement of Chairman Frelinghuysen    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Good morning. The committee will come to order.    This morning the Defense Appropriations Committee holds an open hearing during which Members of the House of Representatives are invited to bring their concerns and issues regarding the future posture and force structure of the Department of Defense directly to our attention.    My ranking member and I are here today to take testimony from our colleagues in an effort to provide maximum Member participation as we work to draft the Department of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2016.    At this time, I would like to recognize my ranking member, Mr. Visclosky, for any comments or statement he may wish to make                   Opening Statement of Mr. Visclosky    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Visclosky.    Our first guest this morning is Jim McGovern from the great State of Massachusetts. Thank you for being with us. And we are prepared to hear your testimony.               Summary Statement of Congressman McGovern    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. McGovern, we thank you for your strong advocacy. I have a number of veterans in my home State of New Jersey. Very therapeutic to have these incredible canines who link up mentally and physically with some of these remarkable soldiers with very, very bad physical and mental wounds. So we are strongly supportive of this program and appreciate what will hopefully be your annual advocacy, that all Members hold the program dear.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Any comments, Mr. Visclosky?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, thank you. That is the idea behind this opportunity. Thanks so much.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Pleased to welcome Congressman Alan Lowenthal from California. We started a little bit early, but a little bit early is not bad down here.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule to be with us this morning.               Summary Statement of Congressman Lowenthal    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Lowenthal, thank you very much for your advocacy. We certainly know over the years that they have built things other than rockets. And I am glad they are doing it.    And, as you are aware, when the President's budget comes over, the last couple of years it has been absent this STAR program. I can assure you that we will put the money back. It is something which is very important, I think, to all of our Members of Congress irregardless of political affiliation. And I think the proof is in the pudding.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, it is a national program and a congressional add that I think we can strongly support.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Pleased to recognize one of our colleagues from the Appropriations Committee, Congressman David Jolly.    David, thanks for being with us this morning.                 Summary Statement of Congressman Jolly    Mr. Frelinghuysen. The committee would like to thank Mr. Jolly for his advocacy in a number of areas, the areas that you have mentioned this morning, as well as other important aspects to our committee. Considering the size of our Navy, which is probably the smallest it has ever been, we need to make sure that our Navy has every capability. So certainly your bringing this issue of this extra technology, which makes the existing program even more worthwhile and capable, it is important for us to be aware of that and we certainly will consider that.    And when you talk about science and technology, those are the initials, just to break them down, those types of investments for the special operations community, considering the burden and responsibility that has been placed on them by our Commander in Chief and by Members of Congress to do some exceptionally difficult tasks around the world, often unheralded and not well known. So certainly that is an aspect of our work that, I think, historically we have been supportive of, but it is good to have some greater advocacy for that as well.    And lastly, just being in this room, for Mr. Visclosky and all of us who work on behalf of the committee, the staff, one of the most remarkable things about my predecessor and actually your predecessor, the late Congressman Bill Young, was his advocacy for this bone marrow program. And the science that has come from that program, besides the whole issue of bone marrow----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Has been transported into other parts of defense healthcare support and into the private sector in ways perhaps you know better than most of us. We had quite a long hearing, 2\1/2\ hours yesterday, with the Surgeon Generals, one of whom, Admiral Nathan, worked particularly closely----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . With Congressman, former chairman Bill Young, and I think he was one of those who was a very strong advocate and supporter of the bone marrow registry program.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So we will be supportive of it, knowing that it helps a lot of those in military life, as well as obviously in civilian life.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Pleased to welcome Congressman Ted Lieu from California. Thank you very much for being with us. We got a little earlier start than we anticipated, but that is not all bad. But we are very pleased you took the time out of your busy schedule to be here with us.                 Summary Statement of Congressman Lieu    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Lieu, thank you for being with us. Obviously, the F-18, in all of its capabilities, we are certainly supportive of the program, and your advocacy here today reinforces that. I want to thank you for being with us.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Absolutely. Thank you so much.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Pleased to welcome Congressman Denny Heck from Washington State. Thank you very much for being with us. We got off to an early start, but we are very glad to have you here.                 Summary Statement of Congressman Heck    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, thank you, Mr. Heck. And thank you for remembering that. And I do remember you coming before the committee last year and telling us what a deplorable situation the schools were in. I mean, that is not the sort of optic we want to have identified with the education facilities of some very key young people.    Let me say, the committee, we don't believe in gridlock here. We actually, as you say, we get some things done, and we are highly appreciative of your advocacy.    First of all, let me salute the good work of the Joint Base Lewis-McChord. I have been on Interstate 5, and it is congested. It has been a few years since I have been out there. But let me salute the work of the men and women who come out of that joint base that have done so much to protect our freedoms around the world. And we will take under consideration your request for $25 million to see what we can do to maybe make the infrastructure, assure better access for the surrounding communities, as well as people onto the joint base.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Look forward to it.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yes, Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you very much, Mr. Heck.    And may I thank the members of the committee, Mr. Graves, for being here, Judge Carter, Mr. Womack, Ms. Kaptur, and Mr. Ruppersberger.    People often ask why we have this opportunity, and it actually gives people an opportunity to sort of lay down some of the issues confronting either their military base or their support for a local or national program. It is an opportunity for people to vent and advocate, and so we are pleased to provide this.    It does surprise me, although this may instigate something for next year, how few people take advantage of this rather public opportunity to demonstrate their support for a particular military platform or for their military base. But I think it is a good opportunity for us to listen and learn. So really appreciate your taking time out of your busy schedules to be here.    Pete and I would definitely be here. But to have you here, we are blessed.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Ms. Kaptur, you have got to use your microphone if you want to be on the record here.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, we know your tenure in Congress has been distinguished and for many years.    I would just like to point out we did try earlier this year, even though it wasn't in the public arena, many of us had an opportunity to meet with, I think, the 13 or 14 new Members of Congress that came in, both Republicans, Democrats who have served in the military and sort of hear what they had on their minds. For those of you who had the chance to find time in their schedule, it was most interesting to hear, including one of our Members who is a member of the Special Forces, just to get their take on their view of our defense posture and some of the things that the Department of Defense ought to be doing. It is a very interesting perspective, very valuable perspective.    So I guess we are going to take a short recess until our next Member comes.    Mr. Carter of Texas. Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Jump in.    Mr. Carter of Texas. I think that the appropriations process is the most misunderstood process in the entire Congress. I think that when you talk to people about appropriations, Members of Congress, it is amazing how little they know about how this works. I don't know what we do to fix that. And when I was in the leadership it was just a dive room vacancy in the understanding of the appropriations process. I don't know how we fix that.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. And it is interesting--I guess I could say this into the record--we look after the needs of all Members of Congress, irregardless of political persuasion, and we look after members of the committee, and we are hugely accommodating. But this is another opportunity for people to sort of come forward, front and center, to be an advocate for their congressional district.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Congressman Jeff Miller, thanks very much for being with us.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We warmed up the room in the brief absence we had between you and the last witness, but we are very pleased to have you here.                Summary Statement of Congressman Miller    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Miller, thank you very much for being with us today. This is a huge issue. This is way beyond what we would call the normal stress. What our pilots and divers go through is a remarkable neurological and probably chemical reaction as they go through a variety of different degrees of elevation or submersion. I think your being here as a strong advocate for this is sort of a wake-up call, and it has been highly educative to me, let me put it that way. And I think this is something that we should be taking a close look at.    I did mention before you came in, we did have the Surgeon Generals of the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy come in yesterday for 2\1/2\ hours for testimony. And I sort of wish that we had had this as a question for Admiral Nathan and General Travis. But it is something that you have raised for our attention, and I think we are highly appreciative of your doing that.    Ms. Kaptur, I did hear the word ``Ohio'' too.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. All right. Thank you very much, Mr. Miller.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Pleased to welcome Congressman Bradley Byrne from Alabama. Thanks for being with us. I guess we are sort of doing this in order of arrival, even though we gave you a specific time.    Welcome. Thanks very much for taking time out of your busy schedule.                 Summary Statement of Congressman Byrne    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Byrne, thank you very much for your testimony. The committee welcomes it and your strong advocacy for the Littoral Combat Ship.    As we have the smallest Navy in our history, we need every ship. It has amazing capabilities. And we obviously on this committee recognize your good work on the Armed Services Committee and the need for more rather than less just because of tyranny of distance, as you mention, to the Pacific, and also your advocacy for the Joint High Speed Vessel, which is a Navy-Marine combination platform, which is also very badly needed.    So we will do our level best to be of support of both of these programs, understanding that we live within some restrictions of the Budget Control Act.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Absolutely. Look forward to it.    Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you very much.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Pleased to recognize Congressman Hank Johnson from Georgia. Welcome. Welcome back. You were here last year.                Summary Statement of Congressman Johnson    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, thank you, Mr. Johnson, for being here once again. And I think the support for this program has been bipartisan each and every year for the many years I have served on this committee, and we know it is a good investment. I think Members of Congress have been supportive of it. And we appreciate your being here as a strong advocate. We are not going to get anywhere in our society without STEM education, and that needs to be in the hands of everybody. And thank you very much for being here.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Pleased to recognize another one of our colleagues who serves in the Armed Services Committee, Congressman Paul Cook from California. Thanks for being with us. Thanks for your patience.                 Summary Statement of Congressman Cook    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Cook, we will do our best. First of all, thank you for your distinguished military service. And may I say the committee has discussed--and there is obviously strong bipartisan support--more investments with ISR, you know, intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance. I mean, that is really where we need to put some more money.    And we know--of course, I will be solicitous--the Marines are the tip of the spear, and when there is a problem around the world, you guys and gals are out there doing it. So this is something we will take a very close look at, see if we could do a little better than we have in the past.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Carter from Georgia, welcome. Thank you for your patience.                Summary Statement of Congressman Carter    Mr. Carter of Georgia. Thank you, sir.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members of the committee. I appreciate you all having me here today. And it is a great opportunity to share with you my concerns and priorities for the military installations within Georgia's First Congressional District.    It is an honor to represent a district which houses four major military installations, every branch of the military, and thousands of veterans who have served our country so honorably. With this unique military footprint, the district's defense elements are important not just to our State and region, but also to our Nation and America's interests around the world.    The First District is the proud home of Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield. As the largest Army installation east of the Mississippi River and home to the ``Rock of the Marne,'' the 3rd Infantry Division, Fort Stewart has a long and storied past as well as a vibrant role in today's national defense missions. Its level of significance and contributions continues to be a point of pride for the district, from spearheading of the events into Baghdad during Operation Iraqi Freedom to the deployment of soldiers to West Africa to help contain the Ebola outbreak. Today, as I speak, the 3rd ID is deployed to Afghanistan and Eastern Europe.    With the Army's planned manpower drawdowns, the maintenance of effective troop levels and mission sets at Fort Stewart has become a very concerning issue. I have heard discussions about reducing the total number of Army brigade combat teams nationwide and additional manpower cuts which could affect the 3rd ID by the reduction of one or even two BCTs. Such reductions would be a severe blow to the ability of the 3rd ID, Fort Stewart, and Hunter to provide their extraordinary capability to our national defense.    Fort Stewart and Hunter are uniquely equipped and strategically located to deliver a devastating blow to our adversaries worldwide. Let me touch on that very quickly. As you know, Fort Stewart and Hunter are located in the Savannah area, in the Coastal Empire Area near the Georgia ports, near the Savannah Port. That gives them quick access to be deployed, and that is very important and something that we are very proud of and we view as a great asset, not only to Hunter and Fort Stewart, but to our Nation as a whole. It has vast training areas, modern facilities, and extraordinary network of intermodal deployment options through nearby ports and on-base and nearby airports.    For those reasons and more, I am requesting that the Army broaden its evaluation of Fort Stewart and Hunter with regard to BCT reductions. That should include factors such as cost efficiencies of operations and speed of deployment. Speed of deployment, what I was just talking about, by being that close to a major port like the Savannah Port, the regional training capabilities with other installations, and community support.    The regional capabilities and multiservice resources include another unique resource of national significance located in the First District, the Townsend Bombing Range. The Townsend Bombing Range is itself owned by the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort and operated by the Georgia Air National Guard. Townsend is integral, not just to the State of Georgia, but also to the Air Force, Navy, Army, Air National Guard, and Marine Corps elements that use it.    Recently, I have learned that the Air National Guard headquarters has signed over the operational control of the Townsend Bombing Range to the USMC because of the apparent ANG inability to devote the necessary personnel resources for the expansion of the range.    While we are excited that the range has expanded to accommodate fifth-generation fighters like the F-35s, there are concerns about access to the range by other services and the provisions of adequate resources to address community concerns. Two counties in my district, Long and McIntosh, are in discussion with the Marine Corps about compensation for losses to their tax digests, and I am working with the Marine Corps to secure clarification on a number of related questions and issues.    Nearby Fort Stewart, my district proudly includes the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base, located in Saint Mary's, Georgia. Kings Bay is the home port for the Atlantic ballistic missile submarine fleet. The fleet of submarines located at Kings Bay plays an indispensable role in our Nation's security as an element of the Nation's nuclear triad. It is currently home to eight Ohio-class submarines, six of which are ballistic missile submarines and two of which have been converted to guided missile submarines.    While these submarines fulfill a critical role in nuclear deterrence and readiness, they will soon be reaching the end of their expected timeline and the replacement will be needed. The last guided missile submarine is expected to be retired in 2028, leaving the Navy with a 60 percent reduction in its undersea strike capacity. Again, the last guided missile submarine is expected to be retired in 2028, leaving the Navy with a 60 percent reduction in its undersea strike capacity.    The first Ohio-class replacement submarine was originally scheduled to be procured in fiscal year 2019, but necessary deferments by the Navy has pushed back that timeline. This means that there may be a gap in the retirement of the Ohio-class boats and the procurement and production of its replacement class of boats. Because of this, I submitted a programmatic request in support of the Department of Defense's budget line of $1.391 billion for the Ohio replacement development in accordance with the President's budget.    The Virginia-class fast attack submarine is another major program with a critical role in defense of our Nation and our Navy. With the Ohio-class replacements on the horizon, Virginia-class submarines will continue to fulfill a larger role in the submarine fleet, especially with their life expectancy projected to reach as far as 2070.    The Virginia Payload Module is a cost-effective way to preserve our undersea strike capacity by adding expanded capabilities and armaments to the Virginia-class submarine fleet. With the rise in deployment and procurement of anti-access and aerial-denial systems, undersea strikes will, through necessity, assume a more dominant role in the future conflicts. It is through an expansion program like the Virginia Payload Module----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Carter, we are highly supportive of and recognize Georgia's incredible role for the Army, the Navy, and the Marines. I don't think there are many States that could match the capabilities of your warfighters who do some remarkable things on behalf of our country.    We want to make sure that we give all of our colleagues an opportunity to speak. But I want to assure you we are focused on the issue of end strength. We know your pride in your congressional district, the incredible work at Fort Stewart, Hunter, Kings Bay. I have been there. They do some incredible.    We are also focused on the submarine, the next generation of Ohio-class. You should know our committee has made that commitment in terms of technology. I think we are headed in the right direction. And with your advocacy, we will get across the finish line.    Mr. Carter of Georgia. I apologize for taking so much time. But when you have got four military institutions in your district, it is all important. And I didn't get to mention the most important one, and I apologize.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Go right ahead. Just briefly now.    Mr. Carter of Georgia. Moody Air Force Base located in Lowndes County, also in my district, home of the A-10s, I just have to mention to you how important that is and how important the A-10s are to our national security. And I just have to get that in, and I apologize.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You did it. There is no reason to apologize.    Mr. Carter of Georgia. Okay.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Carter.    Mr. Carter of Georgia. Thank you very much.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You are a strong advocate. Your constituents can be proud of the good work you do on behalf of our country.    Mr. Carter of Georgia. Okay. Thank you all very much.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Rothfus from Pennsylvania, thank you for your patience.                Summary Statement of Congressman Rothfus    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Rothfus, thank you very much for your strong advocacy. I can ensure you that inside this room in a very public manner there are many members, including yours truly, that are very concerned about this whole transformation and where the Army is going in terms of its aviation goals. And we have a sharp debate, and I think most of us are very highly supportive in recognizing the incredible work of the National Guards throughout all 50 States. And so it is a work in progress. We have slowed down a lot of what the big Army has wanted to do. And we will continue to focus on this issue with a lot of the things that you have continued to bring to our attention.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence from Michigan, thank you very much for being with us. Thanks for your patience.              Summary Statement of Congresswoman Lawrence    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You have good reason to be proud. And may I say that all the members of the committee may not be here, but Mr. Visclosky and I representing them, along with Mr. Ruppersberger, feel that we are actually committed to removing barriers to any position in the military for women. You should be aware that we feel very strongly about that.    The committee has made a substantial investment, if we need to do it, relative to the inexcusable issue of sexual assault. We are not going to stand for it. We have been quite strong, very strong in that regard. It doesn't matter what the service is, what the circumstances are.    And in terms of equipment, we obviously need to recognize that the equipment needs to be adjusted----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . And done in a way that allows more women to serve in more positions. And I will agree with you, I think we need that to have a review as to who is in leadership and to make sure that we have a fair representation. Because certainly, given our commitment over the last couple of years to two wars, women have stood with men in every way, both domestically here at military installations, but in a lot of different, rough, horrible environments abroad. And so I just want to assure you that our committee is committed to those types of goals that you advocate for and have advocated so well for today.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mrs. Wagner, Congresswoman Ann Wagner, thank you for being with us.               Summary Statement of Congresswoman Wagner    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, Mrs. Wagner, thank you for your testimony and congratulations on your son's promotion and his service to our Nation.    I can assure you we are working very closely with the Navy. We obviously have some of the oldest aircraft across the broad spectrum of aircraft that we have to deal with and we will do our level best to address the issues, because obviously the F-18 has incredible capabilities and we still need its capabilities.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, congratulations to you.    Committee stands adjourned. Appreciate everybody showing up and for their support of this hearing.
