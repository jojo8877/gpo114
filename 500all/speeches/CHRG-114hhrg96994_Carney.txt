    Mr. Carney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Maloney for holding this hearing today. And thank you to Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Schweikert for these proposals.    I would like to--I have to admit I don't know a lot about BDCs. And so I found your testimony very interesting. And I just have really two questions.    One is to you, Mr. Foster. On page five, I would like to understand a little bit about how these BDCs are operating in my area. I am the Representative from the State of Delaware, the whole State, which is a very small place.    But I notice on here that it has a pretty big number under it on your map on page five, particularly relative to States that are much, much larger. Can you explain that? Is that a function of our fact that we are the State to incorporate your business? Does that have anything to do with that? Or is that a function of greater BDC activity in my State?    Mr. Carney. Yes. We are doing better than New Jersey--    Mr. Carney. --Connecticut and Maryland, just about.    Mr. Carney. Anybody else? Mr. Gerber, you are from our region, right?    Mr. Carney. All right.    Mr. Carney. Flattery will get you everywhere.    Mr. Carney. It is more a question that these are domiciled in some kind of way.    Mr. Carney. Can you--obviously you are located in our region. Is most of your activity in the region?    Mr. Carney. I think this is a pretty reasonable approach to updating regulations from BDCs. I do share Mr. Himes' concern about the leverage question.    So I would like to kind of follow up where he left off, which was, is there a way--Mr. Gerber, you started to respond to how you might consider addressing that concern. Would you like to follow up on that, or Mr. Arougheti, or Mr. Foster, would you like to address that?    Mr. Carney. Please.    Mr. Carney. It just gives us a little heartburn.    Mr. Carney. He mentioned that.    Mr. Carney. There are market-based controls on that, is that what you are saying?    Mr. Carney. Sure. Absolutely.    Mr. Carney. Great. Anybody else?    Mr. Carney. So maybe what we could do is get some feedback to those Members who have concerns. I am looking at the sponsor just to give us some level of comfort. That is great.    I yield back. Thank you.
