    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Thank you both for being here.    I, too, want to express my concern regarding the allegations reported by ABC, the channel I watch in Chicago, the city that I represent.    But I also want to give you the opportunity, Director Allison, to talk more about the positives. You shared with the chairman about the program dealing with alcohol, but can you talk more about the townhall meetings or the thank-you campaign that you are doing? What are some of the good things?    Ms. Kelly. And can you share just some of the medical and psychological assistance programs that are available?    Ms. Kelly. Well, I just want to thank you for your leadership, and I am sure things will continue to get better and better.
