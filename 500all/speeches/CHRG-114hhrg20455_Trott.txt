    Mr. Trott. Thank you, Chairman, and----    Mr. Trott . I want to thank Ranking Member Deutch for scheduling this hearing.    And obviously, a discussion of the relationship between Egypt and the United States is very important because there is a strategic importance to the relationship.    I didn't get here in time to make an opening statement, but I wanted to mention to the panel that I am very honored today. I have a large Coptic community in my district, and so for the first time in the history of the House, Father Mina from the Orthodox church in Troy, Michigan, is here. He is going to open the House and lead the House in prayer later this morning----    Mr. Trott . So it is a wonderful honor, and I will be happy to welcome him with the Speaker in about an hour.    My question goes to the events that happened a few weeks ago in Minya when the elderly woman was stripped naked and paraded around the city, and I just want each of the panelists to speak to, you know, what is going to be done in response to that outrageous incident? Is President Sisi going to be supportive of a rule-of-law solution? Are we going to engage in ridiculous reconciliation sessions? What is going to happen there? What can we do to help get the right result with respect to that outrageous behavior and incident?    And then generally with respect to religious minorities, how can Congress help move the needle to make sure the situation continues to improve particularly for the Copts in Egypt?    Mr. Trott. Thank you. I think that is a great answer and a great suggestion and I appreciate it. And I have limited time, so I have just one other question I will follow up with you.    So if the Muslim Brotherhood have an exclusive ideology and democracy is an inclusive process, is the Muslim Brotherhood compatible with democracy?    Mr. Trott. Thank you. I yield back.
