    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    To follow up on your questions about the need for our country to invest in a fifth generation of aircraft to take over from the legacy aircraft that have been flying for decades now, the F/A-18, the A-10, and the AV-8B, would all be replaced by our investment in the F-35 fifth generation.    And it is important to note that other nations are investing in fifth-generation aircraft--the Russians, the Chinese--and that is what we mean by a changing threat environment, which America must step up to the plate. And if it intends to remain superior in the air, we must step up to the plate and invest and prepare for the long term. And that is what the F-35 enables us to do.    With respect to those who may have participated in the poll that Chairman Turner referred to and were of the opinion that we should extend the legacy fleet and rely on it for our future protection, isn't it--and I assume they want to do that because it saves money. So penny-wise, pound-foolish, that would apply in this kind of a situation here.    Isn't it a fact that if America were to do what some prefer, which is to extend the life of the legacy fleet, isn't it a fact that operations and supply costs to extend the legacy fleet would cost approximately four times what operations and support costs would be for the F-35 over the next 50 years? Isn't it a fact?    Mr. Johnson. Approximately.    Mr. Johnson. Anyone else want to add to that?    Mr. Johnson. Thank you.    Lieutenant General Bogdan and Secretary Stackley, the Marine Corps declared initial operational capability last year for the F-35B and the Air Force is planning to do the same this year. This, to me, demonstrates a program that is maturing and reaching a point where it would benefit from increased production. Do you agree? And if so, what are some of the benefits and increased production rates for the F-35 program?    Mr. Johnson. Thank you.    I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
