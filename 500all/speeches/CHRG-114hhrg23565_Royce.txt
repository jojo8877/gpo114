    Mr. Royce. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that.    I guess the real surprise here is just how much money we are talking about in terms of revenues to these governments in the Western hemisphere, and across the developing world. You are talking about hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in terms of helping us balance our books and helping those governments as well.    So I think civil society, if it was really focused on just how much money you are talking about here, would bolt upright in terms of trying to figure out a structure in which to capture this information in order to try to capture the revenue flows back to the governments related to this.    The World Customs Organization, is that the entity that we should consider may be the platform for enforcement if we were to work internationally or is it the OECD? Is it their financial action task force that has that 40 plus 9 recommendations?    Is there a way to maybe incorporate this into that entity with the understanding there of how much we are talking about in terms of potential revenue? And therefore, that certainly could compensate for taking on that added burden on the part of that institution.    Where would you begin, and first, what would be the practical problems with establishing such a platform? And second, what would be the political problems maybe in doing it?    Mr. Royce. Would anyone else care to comment?    Mr. Royce. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the panel and I thank you for your continued focus on this. And I think later we can have some conversations between the Members here who--some like Mr. French Hill, who got a little bit of understanding from being over in Treasury as to some of the bureaucratic impediments.    Maybe we can keep a dialogue going, Mr. Chairman, with the panel, as we try to work with some of the government agencies here on the next step. But thank you again for the hearing.
