    Mr. Keating. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Engel, for conducting this timely hearing. I would also like to thank our witnesses for being here today.    It is an important presence that we will be able to discuss with your expertise the intricacies of this framework and I know that my colleagues will benefit from your testimony.    The indefatigable work of Secretary Kerry and Secretary Moniz have helped to advance us to a historical juncture and yet the history of Iran's actions in the nuclear arena do not inspire confidence.    For any agreement to succeed, it is critical that Iran's compliance is verifiable. This will require so-called invasive inspections and monitoring that, to me, are the key to any framework.    There remain further details and questions that I am confident will be addressed this morning and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
