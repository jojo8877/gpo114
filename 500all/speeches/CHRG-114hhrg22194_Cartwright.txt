    Mr. Cartwright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thanks to you, Inspector General Horowitz, for being here today ----    Mr. Cartwright. Sure. To get to the whole truth, and I totally ----    Mr. Cartwright. It is obvious, and I thank you for that. We have smart reform-minded solutions right at our fingertips that could help keep guns out of the wrong hands. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to give these solutions a chance and at least bring them up for a vote.    With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
