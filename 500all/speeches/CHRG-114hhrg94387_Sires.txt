    Mr. Sires. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today to evaluate the state of the affairs in the Balkans. Since the mid-1990s, the region has undergone a great transformation as the wars have ended and political and economic reforms have set in. The region also progressed toward greater integration with European and transatlantic institutions. While great improvements have been made in the Balkans, various challenges still remain including dealing with the impact of Kosovo's independence and the on-going fight against organized crime and corruption in the region.    As we have witnessed over the past year, Russia continues to get influence outside of the borders, forcing the surrounding regions, including the Balkans to be on high alert. More than ever, it is imperative that we continue to be engaged in the Balkans to ensure democracy, security, and prosperity in the region. And I look forward to hearing from the esteemed panels that we have today. Thank you.    Mr. Sires. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you tell me what the level of influence, Russia's influence is in the Western Balkans today, the Russian influence?    Mr. Sires. Are they nervous at all on what has happened with the Ukraine? Are the Balkans nervous at all after seeing what happened in Crimea and Ukraine?    Mr. Sires. But, you know, it struck me that you said the Russians have been helping these countries, and you have been working with the Russians, so which is it? I mean----    Mr. Sires. Ms. Fritz, do you have anything to add to this? Can you add something to this?    Mr. Sires. You don't want to say anything. Can you tell me what progress has been made since Serbia and Kosovo signed the agreement of principles governing the normalization of relations in 2013?    Mr. Sires. Any progress that they have made. I mean, obviously----    Mr. Sires. Do you feel that in 2015, they remain fully committed to this?    Mr. Sires. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
