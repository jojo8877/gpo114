    Mr. Denham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Darcy, the folks that I represent are following two Federal actions that could have significant impact on flood control projects and the flood plain in my district. Can you tell us what impact you perceive from the proposed Clean Water Act rule and the new Federal flood risk management standard on the Lower San Joaquin River Feasibility Study that is now in its final stages?    Mr. Denham. Thank you. I would look forward to that followup.    Mr. Denham. These actions call for all waters in the flood plain to be jurisdictional and allow Federal agencies to have varying interpretations of where the flood plain is, possibly far greater than a 100-year flood plain identified by FEMA. How does this affect the Corps' planning for flood projects in the additional water subject for 404 permits?    Mr. Denham. I would like to follow up with you on that because I have a specific concern, especially for French Camp, a new VA facility that we are looking at putting in in that very----    Mr. Denham . Footprint, yes. One other thing. Can you describe the role that the Corps played in the development of the new Executive Order 13690 regarding flood plains and the new flood risk management standard?    Mr. Denham. Thank you. I have no further questions, but I would like to follow up with you on this project in particular because there does seem to be some, I would say, confusion. I think the Corps probably would define it differently, but certainly there is one area that is covered under the Corps and another area that we are going to cease development in even though it is in the Corps' jurisdiction, and French Camp, which is a project that I have been championing for quite some time along with Congressman McNerney, and our concern is that it is in that area, so I look forward to following up with you. I yield back.
