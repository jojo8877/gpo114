    Ms. Tsongas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all of our witnesses today. And in particular, I would like to welcome you, Mr. Lombardi. As we know, I came to know you in your work at Hanscom Air Force Base, and it is great to see you here in this new capacity. I appreciated very much the work we were able to do then, and I know coming from the Massachusetts environment, you do recognize the opportunities presented by working with the academic communities as well as the private sector and the federally funded research facilities and the opportunities that that creates given the rapid-change environment we live in.    I wanted to revisit some of your testimony and what you talked about the Air Force's efforts to contract with companies that have not traditionally worked with the services. I know this was a pilot project that actually took place at Hanscom. I am just curious as to what your experience was with this type of outreach, and what are some of the best practices and lessons learned that came as a result? Given the universe of companies that are out there, I am also curious as to how you identified and solicited those companies to become part of this effort.    Ms. Tsongas. But how did you identify the people you brought into this effort? How did you reach out to them?    Ms. Tsongas. And this was an experiment, so you weren't really wrestling with the companies' concerns that Mr. Stackley referenced about nontraditional defense companies that don't know how to wrestle with the data rights issues or are concerned about them or the oversight issues. It was really more an experiment that sort of put those things aside?    Ms. Tsongas. And you are taking this into account as you formalize this process and broaden it?    Ms. Tsongas. Thank you.    I yield back.    The Chairman. Mr. Turner.
