    Mr. Carson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we all can agree that we want to keep our skies the safest in the world, period. And I am not convinced that the comparison really to Canada or European models is necessarily accurate. We have twice the airspace and the volume of air traffic in the U.S.    My question is for Mr. Bolen. What are your thoughts, sir--what are your thoughts concerning what my colleagues cite compared to the airspace we see in Canada?    Mr. Carson. Thank you. And this question is for everyone. I would like to hear your concerns and your views about the addition of a physical barricade outside of the cockpit. We have heard from proponents who point out that this measure could be effective and not so expensive, but I have also heard objections. And I am planning to offer an amendment to add a secondary barrier to help with this effort. What are your thoughts, in terms of it being an additional safety procedure?    Mr. Carson. Sure, sure. Yes?    Mr. Carson. Yes, sir. Good job. Thank you, gentlemen. I yield back my time, Mr. Chairman.
