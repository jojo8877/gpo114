    Chairman Royce. This hearing will come to order today on the nuclear agreement with Iran and we continue our consideration of the possible final nuclear accord.    Earlier this month, the administration and our negotiating partners announced the ``framework'' of a final agreement that has to be hammered out by the end of June. Now, all of the essential elements of this inspections regime still need to be negotiated.    But I will mention that it was this committee that passed sanctions originally in the Senate which brought Iran to the table and it was this committee last session that passed unanimously legislation authored by Mr. Engel and myself that would in fact have given the clerics in Iran a choice between economic collapse or real compromise on their nuclear program. That bill passed the House floor 400 to 20 but that bill was held in the Senate.    So today, the ink isn't even dry on this month's announcement but we saw 2 weeks ago the chants led by the Supreme Leader in Iran, ``Yes,'' he said, ``Yes, death to America'' and then later asserted that Iran would not allow international inspectors access to Iran's military facilities.    This weekend, the deputy head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps reiterated, ``They will not even be permitted to inspect the most normal military site in their dreams.''    The administration has shrugged off such comments as Iranian domestic spin but the issue of inspections and verification will be central to how Congress judges any final agreement.    Will inspectors have quick, unimpeded, go-anywhere, anytime access? Who can these inspectors interview? What documents can they review? Can they take environmental samples? Does the IAEA have the qualified manpower and resources to take this on? Can the framework's limited centrifuge research and development restriction really be verified?    Now, Iran's long history of clandestine activity and intransigence prevents the U.S. from holding any trust whatsoever in the clerics who run Iran. Indeed, deception has been a cornerstone of their nuclear program since its inception. So when it comes to negotiating and inspections regime over the next 2 months, the U.S. must gain ground, not retreat.    A key piece of verification includes Iran coming clean on its past bomb work. We recall that the IAEA asked those 12 questions about their testing. They got an answer back up half of the first question and none of the others were responded to. That still has not happened despite long-overdue commitments on the part of Iran to international inspectors.    The IAEA remains concerned about signs of Iran's military-related activities; including designing a nuclear payload for a missile--a nuclear weapon for an ICBM missile. Iran hasn't even begun to address these concerns, and last fall 350 members wrote to the secretary of state expressing deep concerns about this lack of cooperation. Yet, the framework agreement is vague on this critical verification step.    Intrusive inspections are even more critical when you consider a recent Department of Defense study. It points out that the U.S. capabilities to locate undeclared nuclear facilities or convert nuclear programs are ``either,'' in the words of the Department of Defense study, ``inadequate, or more often, do not exist.''    And, critically, that study also reminds us that, ``verification is principally the political judgment,'' in the words of the study, ``to which monitoring and other means contribute.''    The IAEA and its inspectors will play an essential role in monitoring Iran, but it will ultimately be up to the administration and its negotiating partners, which includes Russia and China--likely acting through the U.N. Security Council or another international body--to decide whether Iran is complying with its commitments.    And this is another weak link. If Iran is caught cheating, will this or the next administration be prepared to call them out? I am not confident. Why? Because during the interim negotiations when Iran was caught testing an advanced supersonic centrifuge it faced no consequences. As one witness will testify, international inspectors can be no tougher than the countries that back them.    The history of arms-control inspections is that they are easy for political leaders to tout as a solution, but are difficult to fully implement. What looks good on the chalkboard often fails in the real world.    Even if verified, as one witness will note, this agreement still puts Iran on the path to being an accepted nuclear weapons state. And beginning in 10 years, the administration's lauded 1-year breakout period begins to fall away and Iran will be able to enrich on an industrial scale. At the same time, Iran's Revolutionary Guard is advancing its ballistic missile capability under orders from the Supreme Leader to ``mass produce'' and he has been publicly quite vocal about the need to ``mass produce'' ICBMs.    In announcing this framework agreement with Iran, the President boldly declared that ``If Iran cheats the world will know.'' Today, we will hear from former top weapons inspectors and nonproliferation experts to learn what it would take for that assertion to be true and to be credible.    And I will now turn to the ranking member for any opening remarks he may have.    Chairman Royce. Thank you, Mr. Engel.    We are going to go 1 minute to Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, chair of the Middle East Subcommittee, and then 1 minute to Mr. Ted Deutch, who is the ranking member of that subcommittee.    Chairman Royce. Thank you.    Mr. Deutch.    Chairman Royce. Thank you, Mr. Deutch.    Now we will go lastly, 1 minute, to Judge Ted Poe, chair of the Terrorism and Nonproliferation Subcommittee, and then 1 minute to Mr. Bill Keating, who is the ranking member of the Terrorism and Nonproliferation Subcommittee.    Chairman Royce. Mr. Keating.    Chairman Royce. Thank you.    This morning we are pleased to be joined by a distinguished group of experts. Mr. Charles Duelfer was a top official of the U.N. weapons inspection organization. Mr. Stephen Rademaker is the former Assistant Secretary at U.S. Department of State for the Bureau of Arms Control and Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation.    By the way, Mr. Rademaker is a national security project advisor at the Bipartisan Policy Center and formerly served as chief counsel to this committee and we welcome him back.    And Mr. David Albright is the founder and president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, DC, and has appeared before this committee on numerous occasions and we welcome him back as well.    And without objection, the witnesses' full prepared statements will be made part of the record and members will have 5 calendar days to submit any statements or questions to them or extraneous materials for the record.    And, Mr. Duelfer, please summarize your remarks.    Chairman Royce. I am going to suggest that you get that mike a little closer.    Chairman Royce. Mr. Rademaker.    Chairman Royce. Well, we are going to go to Mr. Albright. But on that cash dimension, what they are doing with that signing bonus in today's Wall Street Journal tens of millions of dollars to--Iran's Revolutionary Guards are transferring tens of millions of dollars this week to the--to the Hamas brigades.    So but anyway, Mr. Albright.    Chairman Royce. So if I can go back to Mr. Rademaker, as I--as I mentioned this morning in the press is this report, and I talked about viewing this sanctions relief as a signing bonus, basically, what are they doing with the relief they already have?    And the fact that the Iranian regime is so engaged right now with the anticipation of getting the relief--the remarks by one of the ministers that, you know, they control four Arab capitals today. He was speaking of Yemen as well as other countries that have fallen under the sway of the Quds Forces.    The Quds Forces is very active and this week, according to Western intelligence, Iran's Revolutionary Guards during the past few months have transferred tens of millions of dollars to Hamas' brigades.    Intelligence reports show that the funds have been transferred on the direct order of the commander of the Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force who also dedicated an annual budget to finance Hamas' military operations.    The funds, according to the intelligence report, are being used primarily to help Hamas rebuild the network of tunnels that were destroyed, and apart from using Iranian aide to rebuild the tunnel network the brigades are also replenishing their depleted stocks of medium-range missiles, according to officials.    So the consequences of this negotiation--this olive branch, to put it in the words of the administration, that is being extended--is not an Iran that is changing its behavior. If we read anything from attitude, you know, you take a look--and I am going to quote Dennis Ross this week from something he wrote:        ``The more the Supreme Leader makes specific points         about the content and purposes of the negotiations in         public the more his comments are likely to tie the         hands of his negotiators.''    I think his point is that, you know, that is what has happened so far. The Supreme Leader insisted in public that Iran have enrichment and what happened? They got enrichment. That they not dismantle the facilities, which I thought was part of the original plan--he succeeded.    That they be allowed to continue R&D, so they succeeded. That they have an industrial-sized program--on all of these points, the U.S. negotiators conceded.    So when the Supreme Leader talks, whether it is on negation positions in terms of the agreement or it is on the position of death to America, a chant that he still leads every week, apparently people listen. And I wanted to ask your opinion and the other panelists' opinion on that point.    Chairman Royce. It is funding.    Chairman Royce. And Mr. Albright, you had a point you wanted to make?    Chairman Royce. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Albright.    Mr. Engel.    Chairman Royce. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.    Chairman Royce. Mr. Brad Sherman of California.    Chairman Royce. Chris Smith of New Jersey.    Chairman Royce. And quit saying ``Death to America,'' if they were rational? Gregory Meeks of New York.    Chairman Royce. I have talked to the chairman too.    Chairman Royce. Mr. Dana Rohrabacher of California.    Chairman Royce. Thank you, and there is the legislation that myself and Mr. Engel have that will overhaul the Broadcasting Board of Governors, especially with a focus on transmitting information into Iran in the same fashion as was done during the 1980s into the former Soviet Union in order to give people access to views on political pluralism, on freedom of speech, on the real stories of what is happening inside that country as well as the rest of the world and that may do a lot.    At least, it did a lot in Eastern Europe to reach audiences. But it is--we need to all work to go on offense in order to get that tool of communication so that those inside Iran can hear information from Surrogate Free Radio. We now go to Mr. Ted Deutch of Florida.    Chairman Royce. Thank you, Mr. Deutch.    Mr. Darrell Issa of California.    Chairman Royce. Well, we can do that in writing. But at this point we are going to need to go to Mr. David Cicilline of Rhode Island. Thank you, Mr. Issa.    Chairman Royce. We go now to Mr. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina.    Chairman Royce. Thank you, Mr. Duncan.    We go now to Dr. Ami Bera of California.    Chairman Royce. Okay. We go to Mr. Lee Zeldin of New York.    Chairman Royce. We go now to Gerry Connolly of Virginia.    Chairman Royce. We go now--thank you very much, Mr. Connolly.    We go now to Ted Yoho of Florida.    Chairman Royce. We go now to Mr. Alan Lowenthal of California.    Chairman Royce. Thank you.    We are going to go to Mr. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania followed by Lois Frankel of Florida.    Chairman Royce. Okay. Lois Frankel, Florida.    Chairman Royce. Thank you.    Now we go to Mark Meadows from North Carolina.    Chairman Royce. Thank you, and let me just express our appreciation for our witnesses for being here today and for the time they have given us and also on this issue of inspections, this verification component and the other parts of this program that we have talked about today.    An understanding of that is going to be critical to Congress as it judges any final agreement. So we are going to have a series of additional hearings on different aspects on the agreement. But it is clear when it comes to the issue of verification that the administration has a long way to go.    So this hearing for now is adjourned. Thank you.
