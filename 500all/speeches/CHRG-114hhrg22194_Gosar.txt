    Mr. Gosar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Inspector General Horowitz, good seeing you again.    Mr. Gosar. In March 2016 you released a report showing you audited three BOP armories in my home State of Arizona: FCI Phoenix, FCI Tucson, and USP Tucson. Did your audit find that firearms and munitions were secure in those three locations?    Mr. Gosar. Any other findings that you feel are important in regards to those three facilities?    Mr. Gosar. Got you. Now, you testified in fiscal year 2014 the Bureau of Prisons recovered 2,410 weapons in BOP institutions, a 5 percent increase from the fiscal year 2012. That is an astronomical number in that many weapons shouldn't even be making their way into these secure prisons. It begs to highlight this. Can you quickly reiterate some of the important recommendations your office made to prevent contraband and firearms from making their way into the BOP facilities?    Mr. Gosar. Mr. Kane, were you paying particular attention to that?    Mr. Gosar. So some of the things that were brought up 13 years ago, why are we still even talking about them today?    Mr. Gosar. So, Mr. Ellis, were you paying attention?    Mr. Gosar. Because it seems like all I get and this committee gets from you is doubletalk in regards to inventories, numbers. You know, we get handbook, pieces copied out of handbooks. So I want to ask you again, were you paying attention?    Mr. Gosar. Okay. Let me interrupt you. I have got a limited amount of time. Do you know how many firearms have been lost since 2005 from the BLM?    Mr. Gosar. How many?    Mr. Gosar. And how many were ultimately recovered?    Mr. Gosar. Do you know how many of these lost firearms are actually connected to any criminal activity?    Mr. Gosar. Well, I am running out of time here, Mr. Chairman, but thank you very much. I yield back.
