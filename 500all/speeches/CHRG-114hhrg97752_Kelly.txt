    Ms. Kelly. Since my day has started, it seems like I have been in meetings dealing with this topic. And one thing that came up was about Turkey and their questionable partnership, are they really true partners. Another meeting I was in, they spoke about how porous their borders are and a lot of things are going through Turkey that are causing problems for the United States and others.    What do you think that we can do to truly get them committed to defeating ISIS, or what can NATO do, if you think they aren't true partners or really committed?    Ms. Kelly. That is very disappointing.    Anyone else have a comment?
