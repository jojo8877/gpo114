    Mr. Bera. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member. And I look forward to hearing from the witnesses.    Obviously, this is an exciting time in the U.S.-India relationship. I mean, it is a remarkable time in terms of the level of economic cooperation and defense, the defense cooperation, and the possibilities are endless.    Working with the chairman, you know, a logical next step in the development of India and, you know, more broadly, South Asia, is India's membership in APEC, and certainly, this body looks forward to working with the Department of State to push for India's membership in APEC, and we continue to encourage that. That not only is beneficial to India, obviously that, you know, sets the stage for the next step, as potentially getting bilateral investment treaty. This also is beneficial to the entire region of South Asia. Obviously, India is an economic powerhouse, but, you know, as India's economy rises and develops, hopefully, that, then, spills over to Bangladesh and the other countries in the region.    So, yes, I do see this, both from the USAID perspective, but also from the U.S.-India perspective and U.S.-South Asia perspective as a great next step to really start to accelerate the South Asian marketplace and the countries.    So thank you. I look forward to hearing that, and I will yield back.
