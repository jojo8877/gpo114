    Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing. It's very important.    As I'm sure everyone has talked about the--how critical it could be to--you know, producing energy in so many areas if we can figure this out.    I visited the NIF--I visited NIF at Lawrence Livermore a few years ago, but I'm going to leave that to Ms. Lofgren to talk a little bit more about that. I'm sure she has some questions and comments about that. But I want to look at what we've been doing over the past few years looking at promising alternative approaches to achieving a viable fusion reactor. They have emerged from some small and midsize startups, as well as academia and our national labs.    And Dr. Hsu, you know well ARPA-E recently established a three-year program to further explore the potential for some of these concepts, particularly on an approach called magnetized target fusion. But like all ARPA-E initiatives, this program is temporary. It does not cover the full range of emerging alternatives that currently receive no federal support.    So I want to ask Dr. Hsu and Dr. Prager, does the Office of Science's current fusion research program have the flexibility to shift resources to promising new approaches if they don't align with the conventional tokamak research pathway? And if not, what can we do to provide the office with the flexibility?    Mr. Lipinski. Dr. Prager, do you have----    Mr. Lipinski. All right. Thank you. I have to run off to a markup, so I yield back. Thanks.
