    Mr. Ruppersberger. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I know it is redundant, but I think it is extremely important. I know our chairman, our ranking member, members of this committee continue to talk about sequestration, which probably is one the biggest threats to our national security. If the American people could sit here and hear the testimony of all the members talking about what sequestration would do, I think they would be very concerned that Congress is not acting. And this is not a partisan issue. We need to get the record where our leadership, Republican, Democratic side to resolve this issue.    When me met last week, you mentioned that a sequestration-level budget will have a detrimental impact on your agency's ability to maintain our missile interception abilities at a level that is ahead of Iran and North Korea missile threat. Now, if your agency is provided with a budget that is at sequestration level, how quickly would you expect our missile interception capabilities to be outpaced?                                ------                                    Mr. Ruppersberger. Okay. Very serious.    Now, let's get to cyber threat to missile defense. Cyber is the future of warfare, and, you know, we are anticipating where we are going to be in the future. Hundreds of thousands of cyber attacks occur every day, many of which are aimed at our military. Please provide us details on what the cyber threats are to the Missile Defense Agency and what you do. Is the primary goal of these attacks to shut down missile defense capabilities or to gather information on our capabilities, and, you know, what are we doing to try to deal with the issue of cyber attacks on what you do?                                     ------                                    Sir, as we discussed, we have a layered strategy that is at the very top with cyber command. Missile defense is at the very top of the priority list, or near the top of the priority list in terms of active monitoring and defenses in a layered way in terms of how that is protected. We monitor it 24/7 and we take it very seriously.    Mr. Ruppersberger. You know, it is unfortunate, especially the Chinese have stolen so much of your space programs and all of our different programs, saving them probably billions of dollars, but also understanding what we do, how we do it, and a lot of their technologies are ours now.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Do you agree with that?                                ------                                    Mr. Ruppersberger. Another reason why Congress has to move ahead in the area of cyber legislation.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Yield back.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Just us and the walls.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Just one thing very quickly, and I want to get into the--China introduced the world's first operation anti-ship ballistic missile, and Iran demonstrated a short-range anti-ship ballistic missile also. I think it is Fateh 110. It is well known that the Chinese ASBM could potentially pose a threat to U.S. ships. How credible of a threat is the Iranian ASBM? And it is my understanding that China is currently developing a next generation ASBM that is based on hypersonic live vehicle technology.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Does the MDA have an estimate on when this technology will be operational and is the MDA currently positioned to be able to provide defensive technologies for next generation ASBM threat?                                     ------                                    Mr. Ruppersberger. We would. Okay.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Does sequestration help, hurt us in this regard also based on----    Mr. Ruppersberger. For the China and Iran----    Mr. Ruppersberger . Iranian threat?    Mr. Ruppersberger. Okay. Yield back.    Mr. Ruppersberger. I don't think we can get into it, but there has been a debate and an issue about east coast missile defense site, and I know at this point you feel that that is not necessary. You have so much population on the east coast. Could you just explain why you feel that is not a priority now, and does that put the east coast at more risk than other areas of the country?    Mr. Ruppersberger. What inventory?    Mr. Ruppersberger. Okay.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Okay. Yield back.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Thank you.    I agree with some of your issues, and I would like to work with you on that too.    Well, first thank both of you, Mr. Secretary and General Odierno, for your leadership. John, I think we served together on the Intelligence Committee years ago, and I hope that your experiences in Congress have helped you doing your job here, which I know it has, because you have done a lot with a lot on the table.    I say it over and over and everyone here talks about it, I don't think anybody on this Committee disagrees, about the issue of what sequestration can do. Now we have before us Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, you are the final here, saying what sequestration is going to do. And I just hope the message gets out to our leadership, Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, that we have to do something about this. We are making our country weaker.    And I would ask this question. Do you feel that this is one of the most dangerous times for the United States of America as far as risk between terrorism, between Russia/China threat, between cyber issues, all of those type of issues?    General Odierno. I think it is one of the most unpredictable times, which cause us to take significant risk.    Mr. Ruppersberger. I just want that for the record.    I am going to get into an area, I started working years ago on this with Jack Murtha, who is no longer with us, that really focused a lot on the military members coming back after being injured, Iraq, Afghanistan, trauma issues, spinal cord injuries, the loss of limbs. And there has been a lot of research with some major hospitals in the United States working with the military. I think right now you have the, it is called the DOD Combat Casualty Care Research Program within the Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, and they do all sorts of research, clinical trials.    There is another group right now that I am going to try to focus on and make a priority, and that is the National Trauma Research Center. They study trauma care. And the purpose of this is to get all of the military, whether it is Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, coming together with some of the best trauma centers we have in the United States coming together. And you will leverage the military and civilian partnerships, merging the hospitals and doctors with that.    Are you aware of that National Trauma Research Center, and if not, would you be in support of it?    General Odierno. No, I am. And I think it is very important for us.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Okay.    General Odierno. Especially as we go forward.    Mr. Ruppersberger. That is great.    Now, the other question I want to get, if I can time----    Mr. Ruppersberger. Keep moving.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Okay. I have two Army bases in my district, Fort Meade and also Aberdeen. And you have Cyber Command, NSA. But also you have Aberdeen, which does all the testing for the Army but also performs a lot in the chemical/biological area and other topics like that. Of course, they are on the list because of sequestration to have cuts in personnel cuts.    Are you aware of those two installations, and what is your focus as far as the future with those installations, and where are we right now as far as cuts?    Mr. Ruppersberger. And these two installations are your priorities and there is a future there, it is a matter of funding.    General Odierno. Fort Meade obviously with CYBERCOM is increasing, actually. Aberdeen obviously is important to us. They do a lot of--you mentioned some of it. They also do a lot of our mission command, command and control work there as well with CECOM located there.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Right.    General Odierno. So they are key installations.    Mr. Ruppersberger. What I tell our Army alliances and the advocates for both of those bases is that there is a sequestration budget, that is Congress' fault, we have got to deal with it, but the budgets you are putting out are budgets that you have to put out on every installation in the country in order to deal with the law the way it is now.    Thank you.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Does that include the Naval Academy?    Mr. Ruppersberger. I have a problem because I am co-chair of the Army caucus over at the Naval Academy board so I can't go to an Army and Navy game, or I am going to get shot by both sides.    The ranking member just talked about the cyber issue. I know you focused a lot in that. General, can you tell us how you feel how serious the cyber threat is to our national security? And secondly, more specifically, what your role will be, I mean, we are fusing information, we are getting the information out, but to national security and also from your point of view on the battlefield?    General Odierno. First, from an institutional perspective, we have much work to do in terms we have it to reduce the number of systems that we have, networks that we have, we have to reduce the number of networks to protect those. We are in the process of doing that. It is going to take investment on our home stations to do that. We have a program in place to do that. That is critical. We have to raise awareness in all our units, the importance of cybersecurity, and computer security and so we limit the ability for people to access.    It is a significantly important issue for us, because frankly, it is a fairly cheap and inexpensive way to attack the United States. If you are able to somehow understand how to attack our systems, whether it be militarily, or institutional systems, or our civil society, name it whether it be financial or our infrastructure, you could have quite a significant impact.    So, it is incumbent on all of us to understand that there is a threat and we witness it every day as we get more and more reports of people trying to attack. So it is critical for us that we work together on these issues.    You know, I think one of the things we have to continue to have, and this is my personal opinion obviously, is a discussion on policies and law, domestic and international law as it relates to this, because we have groups, specifically, non-state actors who are taking advantage, the fact that they are not held accountable of international law because they are not a state. So I find that to be concerning.    In the future for us operationally, I believe that we have to develop capabilities that allow us to tactically use our abilities in order to give us advantage on the battlefield and to protect ourselves against potential attacks of our adversaries. It is going to be critical for us as we move to the future.    Mr. Ruppersberger. You raise a good point. I think cyber command has estimated we would lose over $1 billion a year. Information is being stolen from all of our businesses, our medical, our academia, our space areas and that type of thing. But then there is a destructive attack, with Sony where really they can shut down operations and steal information. And yet, you talk about not only the United States passing legislation, Congress, to deal with this issue, but also we need to do it on a global area, including China, who is probably the most aggressive in stealing from us. You know, Russia is very good in this field also.    But I think--I will say this, under the Intelligence Committee I think is marking up today an information sharing, which will hopefully deal with the issue of the attack like we had with Home Depot and Blue Cross and that type of thing. By this June, this Congress has to pass the PATRIOT Act as it relates to the cyber issue or we will be in a really bad situation where our country will be less safe.    So, just as sequestration is, a lot of what we are doing now is based on what Congress is doing. I am just glad that you are focused on this threat and understand that the training and working together as a team.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Yes. First, thank the panel for your leadership in managing our defense health programs. For the last month or so, we have been having hearings with our military about military modernization, procurement, ongoing engagements, but the need for adequate funding for what you do and the defense health programs could not be overstated. And as you are well aware, these programs are not only important to our men and women in the military, either post-injury or current injuries, trauma, those type of things, but the research and medical technology benefits our citizens also.    I think, General Robb, I am going to talk to you about the National Trauma Clinical Research Program. Research into trauma treatment and prevention remains a top priority for the military, but it also has to compete with many other areas of research. And many advancements in trauma care are a result of extensive deployments on the battlefield, and we must maintain that momentum in trauma research.    I am aware of the Department's efforts to create a coordinated, multi-institution, clinical research network to advance military-relevant topics in trauma care and trauma systems that would allow the Department to maintain the advancement and skill sets critical to progressing in this area of research, even as our combat deployment decreases.    Now, the questions are, number one, could you explain the importance of creating such a network, the value it will provide to maintain military and, transversely, to the civilian communities, and what role the Department should play?    General Robb. Yes, sir. I think if you look at the signature advance in these current conflicts and that is the rapid advances in survivability in our trauma system. And if you roll back time to around the 2005-2006 timeframe, we stood up and placed in theater what was called the Joint Trauma System, and that was the brainchild of then Colonel John Holcomb with colleagues from the Army and the Air Force and the Navy to do an overarching management of the trauma system in the theater, not just in the OR, but pre-hospital, hospital and en route care, and to get all those folks working together for what we call a seamless integration across the continuum of care.    What was just as important during that time was the creation of the Joint Trauma Registry, and that is to collect the data that will back up the outcomes that we were trying to achieve.    One of the other things that happened during this conflict was the Visiting Professor Program, where we invited the senior trauma orthopedics and general surgeons from around the country to participate in the delivery of health care in Landstuhl and at times in our forward locations. So what we started to do was create an incredible alliance and strategic partnership with the trauma community in the civilian sector.    They saw our advances, they saw our data, many of which through damage control resuscitation and damage control surgery have translated back to the civilian sector. Many of the physicians who wore those uniforms in those ORs in the theater also were Reserve doctors who then went back to the University of Cincinnati, went back to the University of Houston, went back to the Baltimore Shock Traumas to deliver those advancing health cares.    Now, that same group of folks, because of those relationships that were built during our conflict, they see that we need to continue this. And so what we are seeing, sir, exactly what you saw, is there is a request out there for research and trauma coordination.    And that is where we create, again, one of our lines of effort, Dr. Woodson's lines of effort, strategic partnerships, with the trauma community out there where we also work together, our military healthcare system working side by side with the civilian healthcare system to continue to advance medicine. They learn from us and then we learn from them in the inter-war years. And that is what I call keeping the pilot light burning and continue the advancements in health care.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Can you tell the committee what additional resources are required for fiscal year 2016 to advance this program forward and what efforts are underway to program for it in the POM, the Project Objective Memorandum?    General Robb. Sir, I will have to get back to you on the specifics.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Okay. You mentioned Maryland Shock Trauma. Could you tell me about it?    General Robb. Well, one of the places--and, again, in fact, I will potentially succeed here the question over here to General Travis--but one of our places where we get great trauma experience is up at Baltimore Shock Trauma.    And, General Travis, I will pass it on to you to give the specifics of that.    General Travis. Yes, sir.    Of course, we are very proud of that, that C-STARS training platform, which provided so much just-in-time training, but we have an embedded cadre of folks up there who are not only teaching our high-acuity or trauma teams, not just doctors, but nurses, technicians before they go downrange. They are also now collaborating in a lot of research, and have been for years.    So the effort you talk about, and we have similar institutions or agreements with Cincinnati, St. Louis, and now University Medical Center in Las Vegas.    Mr. Ruppersberger. That is good. It is expanding. For the record, Maryland Shock Trauma saved my life and I am on the board there.    General Travis. Yes, sir.    Mr. Ruppersberger. And how long has the military been at Shock Trauma with fellows?    General Travis. Got to be going on 20 years.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Twenty years at least, and it has been very beneficial.    General Travis. Dr. Scalea has been incredibly supportive.    Mr. Ruppersberger. No question.    General Travis. And he has participated in the visiting professor discussion that General Robb brought up.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Okay. Yield back.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Yes.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Quickly. Interesting conversation about food. I do enjoy food. And I think one of the things that you are talking about, the serving someone, because buffets are very dangerous. And I think that really makes a difference. So, Tim, I am glad you raised the issue and I think it is important.    I want to get into something Steve Womack talked about, and that is dealing with our men and women coming back who have had severe injuries. I was involved at Maryland Shock Trauma with a face transplant, which took about 10 or 12 years to develop. The people who have to wear masks, because when they come back, they are embarrassed, their faces are blown off. The issues with hand surgeons, losing legs, paraplegics.    I want to talk to you about the issue of the Peer-Reviewed Orthopedic Research Program. Now, I strongly support the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Combat Casualty Care Research Program--did you get that, what that is, okay--to advance cutting-edge battlefield care that has truly saved lives and helped our military coming back home.    I am particularly impressed by the clinical trials and research data coordination being conducted by a consortium of clinical centers that are studying major extremity trauma for the Peer-Reviewed Orthopedic Research Program. And it is my understanding that the program itself, the Orthopedic Research Program, and cooperative agreements for this consortium, which were originally funded in 2009--and I worked in 2009 with then at that point Jack Murtha, who is no longer with us, and he was very involved and active in that plan, and there were a group of us that worked on it--but I understand that the money is running out for that plan.    And it is so important, because we have so many of our military who have lived because of the protection of the vest, but their extremities have been really damaged or they have lost their extremities. And I am really concerned about this program that has so much potential in the future to help our men and women that come back.    And we know we owe them to come back that do not come back whole and how we deal with them and work with them on prosthetics. I remember an issue involving at one time you could only use a hook, and now you can literally start, because of programs such as this, you can literally use fingers to do that. And these are the type of things that we must continue to do.    This also helps the private sector too and the partnership between the private. I keep referring to Maryland Shock Trauma, but I know the Air Force especially working in these programs on research together.    So I have two questions. Please describe for the committee the importance of the role these consortiums play in the medical research field. And secondly, would you support additional funding to the Peer-Reviewed Orthopedic Research Program in order to ensure that this consortium continues and we can help our men and women from the military? Because I understand the money, again, is running out from the original 2009.    Mr. Ruppersberger. It is my understanding Kennedy Krieger, who does a lot of spinal cord research, is working closely, and they feel that if the funding continues, there could be a possibility in 10 to 12 years to start getting these people who are paralyzed from military injuries or any injuries out of their wheelchairs and the ability to walk. But unfortunately that money is slowing down.    So I guess your answer to my question, because I know we are getting late here, is you are clearly in favor of continuing the funding in the Peer-Reviewed Orthopedic Research Program.    Mr. Ruppersberger. For spinal cord, joints, whatever that may be.    Mr. Ruppersberger. Yeah. That is a good point.
