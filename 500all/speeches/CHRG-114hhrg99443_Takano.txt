    Mr. Takano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, it is truly a pleasure to hear from you this morning about your department's priorities. I am glad to hear about the administration's continuing commitment to programs that support working families, educate our children, and keep Americans healthy.    First, I would like to ask you about the Department's work to support LGBT seniors. As you may know, the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, of which I am co-chair, has formed an LGBT Aging Issues Task Force. We sent a letter to Administrator Greenlee asking for ACL to require each State plan to assess whether State units on aging are meeting the needs of the LGBT community in their area.    As you know, LGBT elders have poorer physical health, worse mental health, lower income, and fewer close ties on average than other seniors.    Can you speak to whether ACL will be rolling out a guidance focused on LGBT older Americans, and if not, what will they be doing to assist this aging population?    Mr. Takano. Well, thank you, Madam Secretary. I wonder if you would be willing to have a meeting with the members of the LGBT Caucus to discuss these important issues?    Mr. Takano. Wonderful. Madam Secretary, in your testimony you mentioned the administration's commitment to growing our health care workforce by making continued investments in the National Health Service Corps, and graduate medical education.    Ensuring that we have a robust health care workforce is one of my top priorities. In Riverside County, which I represent, there are only 34 primary care physicians for every 100,000 people. Half the number of doctors needed to provide adequate access to care.    Can you share more about the administration's efforts to guarantee we have the health care workforce that we are going to need?    Mr. Takano. Mr. Chairman, I almost made it. I am sorry.
