    Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity.    And I want to thank our witnesses.    I want to follow up with one of the questions the chairman mentioned. Ms. Huftalin, in working with the various agencies, how do you make sure that you're training the right number of people, not too many and not too few?    Mr. Scott. Thank you.    Dr. Ricks, career training used to be known as vocational education, which traditionally was a dumping ground for people that weren't going to make it academically. Can you say a word about how important it is that the career training include the basics, so if a person wants to get into career training and decides, ``Well, maybe I want to go to a 4-year liberal arts college after all,'' that they are not left behind?    Mr. Scott. And so if someone gets in a career track, it's never too late to switch back to an academic track and go to college.    Mr. Johnson, did you want to comment?    Mr. Scott. Thank you.    Dr. Major, you alluded to the 2-plus-2 program. Can you say a word about that? I think you have commented on the others. I don't have much time left, so you can take the rest commenting on those two.
