    Ms. DelBene. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thanks to all of you for being here with us today. Some of my questions were asked already, but I just had a quick question for you Mr. Hessler on living will requirements and I just wondered what your thoughts were on this legislation in terms of whether or not it would help facilitate the Dodd-Frank living will requirements?    Ms. DelBene. Any other feedback on that one?    Ms. DelBene. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Chair. I yield back.
