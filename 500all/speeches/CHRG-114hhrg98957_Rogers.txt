    Mr. Rogers. Good afternoon. This subcommittee will come to order. We want to welcome to our hearing the President's fiscal year 2017 budget request for the defense-related activities carried out by the Department of Energy .    I want to thank our witnesses for being here today. I know it takes a lot of time and energy to prepare for these hearings, and I really appreciate your commitment in doing that.    Our witnesses today are Lieutenant General Frank Klotz, retired, Administrator, NNSA ; Ms. Monica Regalbuto, Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management, U.S. Department of Energy; and Ms. Joyce Connery, Chairwoman, Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.    General Klotz, you have some very able folks here today in support of you. I would like to recognize them. Admiral Frank Caldwell. Brigadier General S.L. Davis. And Anne Harrington. Glad to have you all here.    If any of our members have questions directly for these folks later in the hearing, we will ensure that they can step forward to the table where the microphones are and respond. And I know Admiral Caldwell has a supplemental written statement that will be introduced and accepted for the record.    Mr. Rogers. Before I hand the floor over to the ranking member, let me briefly highlight just a few key issues for today's hearing.    First, since this is our subcommittee's first budget hearing for fiscal year 2017, let me put a marker down. Let's start the year by putting to rest the notion that our nuclear deterrent is unaffordable. That is just ridiculous. A recent think tank report got it right, quote: ``The issue is not affordability--rather, it is a matter of prioritization. Should nuclear forces, and by extension their modernization programs, be given higher priority in the budget than other forces?''    We have an answer to this question. From the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and everyone down the line, senior leaders across the board have stated clearly and unequivocally that our nuclear deterrent is, quote, ``the Nation's highest priority mission,'' close quote.    So our senior military and civilian leaders have shown that our nuclear deterrent will be robustly supported even if it is at the expense of other capabilities, because it is our top priority. These programs are not optional, and are at the core of U.S. security and international stability. And at the very center of the core are the people and the programs at NNSA that provide our Nation with our nuclear deterrent.    General Klotz, we are happy to have you yet again at our subcommittee representing the dedicated individuals who work at our nuclear enterprise. Their important contributions to the Nation are largely unsung, but we certainly thank them and know what you do and appreciate it. And once again, the subcommittee will take a detailed look at the NNSA's budget request and scrub it hard to ensure it is meeting the Nation's military priorities.    When it comes to meeting the day-to-day needs of the military, NNSA must also focus on the programs that set it up for the future. That means having the people and skills, the infrastructure and tools, and the structures and processes to meet the highly uncertain nuclear future. I fear we are focusing too much on the present and not enough on the future. But we will be getting into that during the question period.    Thank you again to our witnesses for being here. I look forward to the discussion. Let me now turn it over to the ranking member for any opening statement he would like to make.    Mr. Rogers. I thank the ranking member.    We now will ask each of our witnesses to make an opening statement summarizing their written testimony, and I would like to ask you to keep it to 5 minutes so we will have time for questions. Your written testimony will be, without objection, accepted for the record.    First, we will recognize General Klotz for any opening statement you would like to summarize.    General Klotz. Thank you very much, Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Cooper and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to present the President's fiscal year 2017 budget request for the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration. We value this committee's leadership in national security, as well as its robust and abiding support for the missions and people of NNSA. And thank you especially, Chairman, for your kind words for all the people, men and women out there, who work in this important enterprise.    Our budget request, which comprises more than 40 percent of DOE's budget, is $12.9 billion, an increase of nearly $358 million, or 2.9 percent, over the fiscal year 2016 enacted level. This budget request continues the administration's unwavering commitment to NNSA's important and enduring missions.    These missions are defined in the NNSA's Strategic Vision, which we released in the fall of last year. These missions include to maintain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear weapons stockpile; to prevent, counter, and respond to the threat of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism; and to support the capability of our nuclear-powered Navy to project power and to protect American and allied interests around the world.    To succeed, NNSA must maintain crosscutting capabilities that enable each of these core missions. Again, as defined in our Strategic Vision, these crosscuts focus on advancing science, technology, and engineering; supporting our people and modernizing our infrastructure; and developing a management culture focused on safety, security, efficiency, and adopting the best practices across government and the commercial world.    If you would like, Mr. Chairman, I would be very pleased to provide a copy of this document to the subcommittee for the record.<dagger>---------------------------------------------------------------------------    <dagger> The DOE/NNSA Enterprise Strategic Vision--August 2015 can be found at https://www.scribd.com/document/290190538/NNSA-Enterprise-Strategic-Vision-August-2015---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Mr. Rogers. Without objection.    General Klotz. The budget materials and briefings we have provided over the past 2 days to you and to your staff describe NNSA's major accomplishments in the year 2015, as well as the underlying rationale for our budget proposal for fiscal year 2017. Let me just briefly highlight a few points, given the time we have.    First and foremost, the United States has maintained a safe, secure, effective, and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear explosive testing for over 20 years. As a result of consistent funding provided by this Congress, supported by this subcommittee, and the significant improvements that NNSA has made in program management over the past 2 years, all of our life extension programs are on schedule and within budget.    NNSA's science and technology base also continues to yield critical modeling and simulation data in support of the stockpile. In fact, just last year the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory increased its shot rate, its experiment rate, from 191 in the year 2014 to 356 in the year 2015, almost doubling it, including the first-ever experiments involving plutonium.    Our budget request also supports recapitalization of NNSA's aging research and production infrastructure, most notably the facilities where we perform our major uranium, plutonium, tritium, and other commodity operations. Of significance, NNSA completed the first subproject for the Uranium Processing Facility, entitled Site Readiness, last year, on time and $20 million under budget.    As a whole, NNSA will arrest the growth of deferred maintenance in fiscal year 2016 thanks to the appropriations bill which the Congress passed at the end of last year, and with your support for our budget request, we can begin to reduce deferred maintenance in fiscal year 2017.    This year's request for the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account, as Mr. Cooper pointed out, is 6.8 percent lower than the fiscal year 2016 enacted levels, for two reasons. First, prior year carryover balances are available to execute some of the programs. And second, as you know, we proposed terminating the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Project and pursuing a dilute and dispose approach as a faster, less expensive path to meeting our national commitment and international agreement to dispose of 34 metric tons of excess weapons-grade plutonium.    The request for our third appropriation, the Naval Reactors Program, keeps pace with mission needs and continues NNSA's commitment to the three major initiatives: the Ohio-Class Reactor Plant System Development; the Land-based S8G Prototype Refueling Overhaul; and the Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project in Idaho.    I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, Admiral Frank Caldwell, who is testifying, I believe, for the first time in front of this subcommittee.    For each of these missions, NNSA is driving improvements in our management and governance. For all of our programs, we have instituted rigorous analyses of alternatives, defined clear lines of authority and accountability for Federal and contract program and project management, improved cost and schedule performance, and ensured that the Federal project directors and contracting officers had the appropriate skill mix and professional certifications to effectively manage NNSA's work.    Our budget request for Federal salaries and expenses reflects an increasing emphasis on improving program and project management across all our mission pillars.    So in closing, Mr. Chairman, the nuclear security enterprise continues to make significant progress. Through discipline, careful planning, and your continued and strong support, we believe we can make smart investments to build on that progress and meet new challenges in the future. Again, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.    Mr. Rogers. Thank you. There was, as the ranking member said, a lot of good news in that opening statement, none better than seeing that you are finally starting to cut into the backlog of deferred maintenance. That is a nice milestone. I appreciate that.    Ms. Regalbuto, you are recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. I thank you.    Ms. Connery, you are recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. Thank you. I thank all the witnesses. We will now move into questions, and I will start with myself.    General Klotz, I want to go back to what I was just talking about a minute ago on that deferred maintenance issue. From our conversation yesterday, my understanding is this year's fiscal year 2016 budget allowed you to basically take care of deferred maintenance, to make sure we don't add to the backlog, so basically level funded. And from my understanding, this new number in fiscal year 2017 will allow you to cut into the backlog.    Can you explain that? Because there seems to be some dispute that this number would allow you to actually go into the backlog, as opposed to level funding for another year.    General Klotz. Thank you very much for the question, Chairman Rogers. Thank you also very much for your leadership on this important issue.    When I was in the military, I learned that when dollars are constrained, the first dollar always goes to operations and maintenance of the weapons systems, and the dollar that goes to fix infrastructure and facilities always gets deferred to the right. And if you keep deferring it to the right, over time you get to a point where your facilities and your infrastructure reach a tipping point and it begins to impact both operations and maintenance, as Chairman Connery just mentioned, in some of our facilities.    This year we are asking for $3.7 billion in our ask--our backlog is at $3.7 billion--and what we are asking for will, in fact, begin to cut into it. I think the confusion--and I went back yesterday after having discussed this with you and your staff yesterday--I think the confusion is the chart that we used with the staff yesterday is of such a scale, that the decrease that we see----    Mr. Rogers. It doesn't show up.    General Klotz . Doesn't show up. It doesn't show up. I think that is the explanation I have been given by my staff.    But 2 years ago, the Secretary of Energy asked all elements of DOE to halt the growth of deferred maintenance, and we have worked very hard to put that into our budget. And because of the support we got from you last year, we begin to level it in 2016, and if we get the request that we want, we will begin to see that go down.    Mr. Rogers. Great. Thank you.    You heard me say in my opening statement that NNSA may be a bit too focused on the present at the expense of the future. Now, I am the first to admit that this subcommittee has long been asking you and your predecessors at NNSA as a whole to get on top of today and the issues like life extension programs and big ongoing construction projects, and to your credit, you guys have made some significant steps in those areas.    So I commend you, while also encouraging you to keep reaching. That is the job of an oversight committee, after all. But it is very important that we be thinking about these future endeavors. So let's talk about the future.    Reviewing the budget request, I am deeply concerned that NNSA is proposing major cuts to three forward-looking, future-focused lines that develop and mature safety and security technology for future warheads. By quick math, it looks like the request would short the safety and security technology maturation activities by almost $140 million. That seems very shortsighted, like we are simply locking ourselves into current technologies.    Why is the NNSA proposing this? Is it just lack of funds?    General Klotz. Yes, sir. The short answer is yes, sir. We have a lot of projects we want to cover in our weapons activity account in fiscal year 2017. I think the most important thing is we have very stable life extension programs, which are a very high priority for us and a very high priority for the Department of Defense, which expresses its requirements through the Nuclear Weapons Council. We are on important glide paths on all of those, and we wanted to make sure that those continue.    So it was some tough decisions made, and of course General Davis is here to dig into the details if you would like. We do that. We felt that was the way in which we could balance the budget within the top line that we were issued.    Mr. Rogers. Great. Congress has recently authorized two new programs for NNSA that are future-focused, the Stockpile Responsiveness Program and the Prototype Nuclear Weapons for Intelligence Estimates, PNWIE, program. These programs were created by Congress at the urging of several expert commissions and are about ensuring NNSA has the capabilities and skills to respond quickly to new or changing environments. The Stockpile Responsiveness Program is only a few months old because of the veto silliness on the fiscal year 2016 NDAA , but tell me what NNSA is doing to implement it in this year and fiscal year 2017.    General Klotz. Thank you very much, Chairman. This, by the way, is something which we fully support. It is extraordinarily important that throughout our complex we continuously exercise all the capabilities associated with maintaining the stockpile from design, to development, to manufacturing, to prototype building, and conducting the various experiments that test the various components associated with the nuclear weapons stockpile.    Many of these activities are already exercised on a routine basis as we do our life extension program and as we do the routine surveillance and the science, technology, and engineering that lies under that.    NNSA has recognized for some time the importance of maintaining stockpile responsiveness. And in the fall of 2014, the Defense Programs, which has responsibility for weapons activities, chartered what they call the Defense Program Advisory Group and asked them what was required to challenge the workforce and sustain the capability for the future. They have, in fact, had meetings up till now, and we are expecting a report early in 2016 which deals with that.    One approach that we are using that I would like to highlight here that has not received much publicity is that we are engaged with the United Kingdom on a program called the Joint Technology Demonstration, the JTD. The United Kingdom, like us, faces many of the same issues associated with sustainment of their nuclear deterrence, and we are working together to craft a program in which designers and program managers in both the U.S., and our laboratories, and in the United Kingdom will work together through design, develop, and issues associated with manufacturing of components for nuclear weapons.    We are also carrying out a number of hydrodynamic and subcritical experiments. We have asked for money in this budget to, in fact, enhance our capabilities to conduct those types of experiments at the Nevada National Security Site, and we have also engaged in a number of other certification readiness exercises associated with it.    So we need to come back with you--you are right, the NDAA was signed late in the year--and come back to you with a more fully fleshed-out plan about how we propose to go ahead. But we fully share both the sentiment and the objective as laid out in the program.    Mr. Rogers. Great. I thank you very much.    The Chair now recognizes the ranking member for any questions he may have.    Mr. Rogers. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Franks, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. I thank the gentleman.    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from the great State of Alabama, Mo Brooks, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Bridenstine, for 5 minutes.    Oklahoma. I am sorry. That was very disparaging. I did not mean to say that.    Mr. Rogers. I thank the gentleman.    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Wilson, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. Without objection.    Mr. Rogers. And I would say he does make a good point, baseline is required. So I would ask you to try to expedite that if you could.    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Bishop for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. I thank the gentleman.    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Lamborn for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. Great. I thank the gentleman. I thank the witnesses. I wanted to do a second round of questions, but we are going to be called for votes in a little over a half an hour. So we will just submit those to you and ask that you provide written responses for the record in the next 10 or 12 days.    But with that, I would like to recess for about 5 minutes while we go to 2337 for the classified portion--oh, 2216. Faking you off there. We will see you in 2216 in just a few minutes.    =======================================================================                           February 11, 2016      =======================================================================                           February 11, 2016=======================================================================            =======================================================================                           February 11, 2016=======================================================================          General Klotz. The President's FY 2017 budget proposes to terminate the MOX project. The Department will request the MOX prime contractor to determine activities required to place the facility and project in a safe and secure state, winding down construction, design, support, and procurement efforts as quickly as possible so that termination can be done efficiently and cost effectively. DOE will issue contract direction to MOX Services as early as practicable to halt construction activities for 90 days while the discussion and development of a termination plan take place.   =======================================================================                           February 11, 2016=======================================================================         Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, the Stockpile Responsiveness Program is only a few months old because of the veto silliness on the FY16 NDAA, but tell me: What is NNSA doing to implement it this year and in FY17? How is NNSA going to adjust and refocus its RDT&E and stockpile activities to meet the intent of the Stockpile Responsiveness Program?    General Klotz. NNSA recognizes the nuclear security enterprise's need to maintain the complete set of skills and expertise to respond to future stockpile challenges. The enterprise need includes exercising all capabilities required to ensure that the nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure, effective, reliable, and responsive as required by the fiscal year (FY) 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).    Several activities within the current Stockpile Stewardship Program that meet the direction of Section 3112 of the FY 2016 NDAA have already been implemented. Relevant activities include:    <bullet>  Planning for an increased rate of hydrodynamic and subcritical experiments (at Nevada National Security Site, U1a facility) to test and exercise designers, engineers, and experimentalists.    <bullet>  ``Certification Readiness Exercises'' (research and development studies and experiments) for our technical experts to identify and reduce technical risks to the life extension programs early in the process.    <bullet>  Significant acceleration of the shot rate at the National Ignition Facility to exercise designers, experimentalists and diagnosticians.    <bullet>  Collaboration with the United Kingdom on the Joint Technology Demonstrator, which exercises the workforce throughout the design, develop, manufacture, and prototype lifecycle.    <bullet>  The Defense Programs ``Capabilities for Nuclear Intelligence'' (CNI) portfolio with the Research Development Test & Evaluation portfolio provides training and development activities for designers, engineers, and experimentalists on non-US nuclear weapons concepts, providing great benefit to the stockpile stewardship program.    <bullet>  120-day studies on interoperable warhead concepts, conducted in 2012, which also tested the capabilities of technical experts.    <bullet>  Additionally, in early FY 2015, NNSA's Defense Programs Advisory Committee began analyzing how well current stockpile stewardship activities exercise and challenge the workforce throughout the entire nuclear weapons life cycle. The committee expects to deliver a report to NNSA in 2016, providing their recommendations relevant to the Stockpile Responsiveness Program. This report will provide a basis to establish the scope required to ensure stockpile responsiveness in the future. The FY 2018 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan will more fully address NNSA's plan for the Stockpile Responsiveness Program based on these results and further analysis.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, unlike the newly born Stockpile Responsiveness Program, the PNWIE program has been statutorily required for three years. Just a few weeks ago--and almost a year late--the committee received the NNSA lab directors' plan for how to carry out this program. But the cover letter states that DOE ``is not advocating for implementation of the plan.'' Meanwhile the law explicitly says ``the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the directors, shall carry out the plan,'' but gives him the authority to adjust how it is implemented. General, I know we share the same goals here. We want to set NNSA up for the future and we want our lab scientists and engineers to do this work. What are you doing to implement this program? When will you begin executing an initial PNWIE effort?    General Klotz. There was no funding authorized or appropriated specifically for the Prototype Nuclear Weapons for Intelligence Estimates (PNWIE) program in fiscal year (FY) 2016. However, DOE/NNSA is already executing activities that exercise the continuum of integrated lifecycle activities, including design, development, prototype building, and experimental testing. These activities include intelligence-informed efforts conducted by Defense Program's Capabilities for Nuclear Intelligence (CNI) program, which is coordinated with the Foreign Nuclear Weapons Intelligence Initiative (FNWII). The CNI effort includes a training and development practicum as well as activities that range from materials characterization to modeling to sub-system level testing. Of note, NNSA is also allocating additional funding to the Joint Technology Demonstrator (JTD) program that we recently initiated with the United Kingdom. The JTD program will sustain core capabilities in the design, manufacture, testing, fabrication and assembly of flight-ready hardware. Finally, we are developing a stockpile responsiveness framework to summarize and examine the FNWII, JTD and all ongoing stockpile activities that are responsive to the goals of section 3111 of the FY 2015 NDAA.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, what more could NNSA be doing on deferred maintenance if provided additional funding? We need to start bending this curve down and Congress needs to step up. Can you please provide a list of high-priority projects that you aren't funding in the request?    General Klotz. Over the past three years, NNSA has been successful in slowing the annual growth of deferred maintenance from $250M/year to $100M/year. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2016 allows us to stop the growth of deferred maintenance. Our FY 2017 request allows us to begin reducing deferred maintenance and arresting the decline of NNSA infrastructure by:    <bullet>  Increasing funds for recapitalization and maintenance efforts    <bullet>  Disposing of excess facilities    <bullet>  Increasing buying power via strategic procurement of common building systems across the enterprise (e.g., roofs, HVAC)    <bullet>  Improving project management capabilities to make risk-informed investment decisions    However, additional strategic investments in infrastructure could be made to accelerate NNSA's progress in arresting the declining state of infrastructure and reducing deferred maintenance. As requested, a list of prioritized infrastructure investments is provided below. Note that neither I nor the Secretary endorse any of these additional priorities given the spending limits created by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA). We have made extensive efforts to thoroughly assess, prioritize, and balance the program to achieve the major requirements in the FY 2017 budget request. Any extra funding inserted into our Recapitalization program will come at the expense of other programs we deem more important to the effectiveness of the nuclear enterprise as a whole.

General Klotz, you submitted a plan last September on three projects where NNSA was considering using public-private partnerships to build new, modern buildings and get out of some of these ancient facilities. What's the status of these projects? Why can't we get these going as public-private partnerships?    General Klotz. As stated in our Public-Private Partnerships Report to Congress, we are required to perform an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to determine best value to the government. When completed, our analysis must be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as consistent with the A-94 and A-11 guidelines agreed to by OMB, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Congressional Budget Committees.    Pantex Administrative Support Complex (ASC):    DOE's AoA for the Pantex ASC revealed that a public-private partnership would satisfy the mission need at the best value to the government.    High Performance Computing Innovation Center (HPCIC)/Collaboration in Research and Engineering for Advanced Technology & Education     NNSA is completing business cases for each of these projects, but has not yet submitted them to OMB review.    NNSA Albuquerque Complex Project (NACP):    NNSA included the NACP as a line item in the FY 2017 President's Budget Request.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, I want to revisit with you my theme of setting NNSA up for the future. You'll recall an editorial ``Mr. Moniz's Nuclear Warning'' by the Wall Street Journal, published January 12th, that is based on a remarkable letter from your boss, Secretary Moniz, to the Director of OMB. The letter points to the problem we discussed--decaying NNSA infrastructure--as well as many other problems that require significant funding to address. The letter concludes by requesting that in the FY17 budget request OMB provide NNSA ``an upwards adjustment of $5.2 billion over FY18-FY21 to fund the Administration's goals and priorities'' related to the nuclear enterprise. It goes on: ``Failure to address these requirements in the near term will put the NNSA budget in an untenable position beginning in FY18, will not provide an appropriate statement of the Obama Administration legacy, and will provide a misleading marker to the next Administration as to the resource needs of the nuclear security enterprise.''    So General Klotz, we're talking about the future. And the budget request before us--while okay in the immediate year--the Secretary of Energy is saying it is short a billion dollars a year over the next 5 years. And we've heard GAO say that there is a major gap between NNSA's programmed activities and its out-year budget profile.    You have a duty to be clear with Congress and the American people: What are the no kidding budget requirements for the 5-year program at NNSA? Does the budget request and 5-year plan before us fix the issue the Secretary wrote about in his letter to OMB?    General Klotz. I am confident that the FY 2017 President's Budget for NNSA meets all of our national nuclear security requirements.    We will be able to do so because the President and Congress reached an agreement last fall to raise the FY 2017 sequester cap in the Bipartisan Budget Act. This provided us the necessary flexibility to put together a responsible FY 2017 budget.    The budget projections for future years, FY 2018-FY 2021, remain subject to the sequester caps set in the Budget Control Act of 2011. Adjustments to the Congressional sequester caps are needed so the next Administration can continue the progress we have made in our nuclear security programs.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, will NNSA submit a rebaseline on the MOX project, as required by the FY16 NDAA?    General Klotz. Yes. The Department is in the process of updating the performance baseline.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, we see that the budget request includes a substantial decrease in the amount that was expected to be requested for the life extension program for the W80-4 warhead that will arm the LRSO cruise missile in the late-2020s. Last year you projected you would request $312 million for this program in 2017, but now we see you are only requesting $220 million. This is a 30% reduction and it's occurring very, very early in the program. I'm worried this shows a lack of commitment to this incredibly important program. Our military and DOD officials have spoken repeatedly about the critical nature of getting LRSO in the field. So, to be clear, is the Obama Administration 100% committed to the 2025 date for a first production unit for this warhead? Is this commitment iron clad and will this budget request support that? Can we say we have your word on this?    General Klotz. Yes, the Administration is committed to the 2025 date for a first production unit (FPU) of the W80-4. NNSA balances priorities among the near-term and long-term needs of managing the stockpile to include life extension programs; necessary sustainment and recapitalization of infrastructure; essential investment in research, development, test, and evaluation; and activities to maintain the expertise of the highly-skilled workforce to ensure a responsive capability. The W80-4 Life Extension Program (LEP) remains a high priority. The reduction was caused by the delay in budget execution as a result of the 2016 continuing resolutions. This delay slowed technology maturation activities in Phase 6.2 (Feasibility Study and Design Options) and has resulted in a projected carry-over of roughly $50 million that will be used to address program requirements in FY 2017.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, the B61-12 and W76-1 life extension programs are both well underway at this point. Please give us a status update on these programs. Are you confident they will finish on time and on budget? What are the major risks to the successful execution of these programs? Are they technical? Or are they in getting the funding needed to execute?    General Klotz. The FY 2016 enacted budget for the B61-12 Life Extension Program (LEP) is $643.3 million and the FY 2017 budget request is $616.1 million with $2.9 billion planned for FY 2018-2021. That funding profile reflects the transition from Development Engineering (Phase 6.3) to Production Engineering (Phase 6.4), which occurred in June 2016, as component activities begin pilot production and production qualification activities. The final cost and schedule baseline for the B61-12 LEP will be completed in August 2016 as part of the Baseline Cost Report.    As with each major modernization program budget, the FY 2016 budget for the B61-12 included an amount of management reserve to address emerging risks and has been used to offset shortfalls in leveraged science and engineering programs that are supporting technology or production readiness. The B61-12 LEP expects to carryover a portion of the risk based funds into FY 2017 giving it the ability to support the W88 ALT 370 reprogramming proposed in FY 2016. While there are potential concerns with reducing the B61-12 risk funds, there is a greater impact if the W88 ALT 370 is not fully funded in FY2016. Currently, the B61-12 LEP shares $250 million in common electronics development costs with the W88 ALT 370. If these activities were delayed, it would impact B61-12 common scope and/or increase B61-12 costs. On balance, it is a manageable risk to fund $5 million of the W88 Alt 370 reprogramming. That is not to say that the reprogramming carries no risk to the B61-12 LEP, but this option does offer the least risk to the overall Defense Programs mission.    The most significant risks to the B61-12 LEP are inconsistent funding, significantly reduced funding, and continuing resolutions of significant duration. If the program does not receive the funding requested through the Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP), the program may not be able to complete the work load that has been planned for each year, address risks that are realized in future years, or maintain the current schedule. Additionally, a year-long continuing resolution in FY 2018, for example, could hold the program to the FY 2017 funding level--a reduction of more than $110 million from what is planned in the FYNSP for FY 2018. Those unplanned and dramatic funding reductions are the most serious risk to the program.    The W76-1 LEP is on schedule and within budget. The program is in its eighth year of full-scale production. By the end of FY 2015, NNSA had delivered almost 60 percent of the total required W76-1 warheads to the United States Navy. The last production unit will be produced no later than the end of FY 2019.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, counterintelligence and cybersecurity threats to NNSA and its facilities are increasing in quantity and sophistication. Can you assure us NNSA can defend against all of these threats and prevent the escape of sensitive information? The DOE-IG recently reported on a host of problems NNSA is having implementing its ``2NV'' cloud computing solution. What did the IG find and do you agree with them? How are you fixing this?    General Klotz. The NNSA is doing everything it can to assure that it is protecting the information and information assets with the funds appropriated and the resources available. Cybersecurity is one of the greatest challenges the U.S. Government faces. NNSA is always working to stay ahead of our adversaries to protect our networks and databases. We take this task very seriously as our program is responsible for safeguarding our Nation's most sensitive nuclear security information. We are modernizing our sensors and defenses, conducting independent performance evaluations, and have employed a strong central control construct to reduce our risk and the probability of data exfiltration.    However, there are no guarantees in cybersecurity, the adversaries are continually evolving using more advanced technology and there are always opportunities to improve our security posture.    With regard to the NNSA's challenges with 2NV, the DOE IG identified three basic points of failure: lack of project management, lack of oversight, and ineffective communication mechanisms between project teams and NNSA leadership. NNSA concurs with the IG's assessment of the project and through reforms that have been implemented since the initial launch of the 2NV project, NNSA is confident that we have put in place the administrative infrastructure needed to ensure effective implementation of 2NV and our other IT projects.    NNSA has carefully reassessed project requirements and realigned the deliverables to mission and business functions. NNSA has also implemented numerous project management improvements. Most notably, we have issued and implemented the requirements of NNSA Supplemental Directive 415.1, Project Oversight for Information Technology, and established the Office of Policy and Governance to provide ongoing, independent oversight for our projects to ensure the principles of the new directive are consistently applied.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, when will NNSA submit data in compliance with subsection (f)(4) of 50 U.S.C. 2441a, regarding the number of contractor employees who have been employed under a service support contract to NNSA for a period of greater than two years? This information is critical to understanding whether NNSA is illegally employing personal service contractors. Please submit the data by to the committee by the end of March.    General Klotz. NNSA does not have any personal service contracts, as we do not have statutory authority to enter into such contracts. NNSA submitted data in compliance with subsection (f)(4) of 50 U.S.C. 2441a regarding support service contracts with the President's FY 2017 Budget. A copy of the appropriate section from the President's FY 2017 Budget is attached (please see attached graphic).    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, please elaborate on why NNSA proposes such significant cuts to technology maturation efforts within Defense Programs. What are the long-term effects of such cuts?    General Klotz. In the FY 2017 President's Budget Request, technology maturation (early development) funding was reduced in order to fund higher priority needs within the weapons program. NNSA is balancing near and long-term risks in a fiscally constrained environment, incrementally prioritizing long-term technologies for planned insertion opportunities in future stockpile modernization programs.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, NNSA's staffing analysis shows that Defense Programs and Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation program have the same number of federal employees. But Defense Programs has four times the funding and most of the safety, security, and liability issues. Why is there such a huge imbalance in staffing?    General Klotz. Both Defense Programs (DP) and Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) require an appropriate amount of staffing to ensure their respective mission requirements are achieved.    Since FY 2012, the DNN full-time equivalent (FTE) count has decreased from 260 to its FY 2017 projected level of 187 (28% decrease).    The DNN business model includes managing twelve major programs to a global customer base supporting over 100 countries, international and USG interagency partners. DNN also exercises nuclear export control regulatory responsibilities which has significant federal manpower responsibilities.    As DNN's mission evolves in response to future Presidential policy guidance related to global nuclear security threat reduction, the program will continue to analyze how the future mission requirements will impact future manpower and staffing needs. In FY 2017, DNN will continue its efforts to meet current and future workforce needs by analyzing how evolving missions are affecting job requirements.    NNSA, like other technically inclined agencies, faces increasing attrition numbers on an annual basis, due to the difficulty of attracting and retaining skilled, trained, and educated individuals to fill (and backfill) critical roles within the nuclear security enterprise. NNSA has embarked on a workforce and human capital strategy which leverages all the management tools and flexibilities at our disposal to ensure that we recruit, hire and retain the best workforce to execute our mission. Reshaping of the entire NNSA workforce, including DNN and DP, over the next several years will be essential to effectively executing our mission. This includes identifying and developing the appropriate skill sets as well as examining the size of the overall and programmatic work forces.    Mr. Rogers. Ms. Regalbuto, you served on the technical team for the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) under Secretary Chu and now you lead DOE's Environmental Management program. Just this past year, DOE asked the court to amend the consent decree to provide the Department another two full decades before being required to start processing tank waste at the Hanford Site in Washington State. Do you believe you can get the entire WTP system, including WTP's pre-treatment facility, operational by 2039? Will you have to build more double shell tanks at Hanford and at what cost? What will be the total lifecycle cost for WTP for design, construction, operation, and eventual demolition?    Mr. Rogers. Ms. Connery, what are the safety impacts of NNSA's deteriorating infrastructure and $3.7 billion backlog of deferred maintenance? Is all of this decrepit infrastructure becoming a safety hazard? Has your Board held any hearings on this issue, or sent any letters to DOE or NNSA? Does DNFSB support efforts to buy-down NNSA's backlog of deferred maintenance?    Mr. Rogers. Ms. Connery, do you believe DNFSB's enabling statute requires all Board Members to be provided full access to all Board information, including information on all Board employees and personnel? Congress has legislated on this matter twice and that was the clear intention. Do you agree?    Mr. Rogers. Ms. Connery, what steps are you taking to address the concerns expressed by DNFSB employees in recent OPM employee surveys?    Mr. Rogers. Admiral Caldwell, you're putting together a report to Congress on the potential of using low-enriched uranium fuel in navy reactors. Your predecessor (who is now your boss) told us last year that there are no military benefits provided by switching to low-enriched fuel in Navy reactors. Do you agree?    Mr. Rogers. Admiral Caldwell, what are your top priorities for FY17? Is your budget aligned with that of the larger Navy? What happens if your program gets out of alignment with Navy programs like the OHIO-class Replacement program?
