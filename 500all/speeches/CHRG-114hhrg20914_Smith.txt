    Chairman Smith. The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare recesses of the Committee at any time.    And welcome to today's hearing entitled ``Ensuring Sound Science at the EPA.''    Before beginning our hearing, however, I'd like to welcome a new member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Warren Davidson from Ohio's Eighth Congressional District. He won a special election two weeks ago to succeed John Boehner.    Representative Davidson graduated from West Point and has an MBA from Notre Dame. He served in the Army in the 101st Airborne Division and as an Army Ranger. After his military service, he returned to Ohio and took a manufacturing company from 20 to 200 employees. He will be a member of the Space and Oversight Subcommittees. As the only member of the Science Committee from Ohio, he will be popular with the aerospace and energy R&D companies in his state. Please welcome Warren Davidson to the Science Committee.    I'll now recognize myself for five minutes for an opening statement and then the Ranking Member.    The Environmental Protection Agency has become an agency in pursuit of a purely political agenda rather than an agency that protects the environment. Little that the EPA has proposes would have any significant impact on the environment. But that hasn't stopped the EPA from imposing some of the most expensive and expansive regulations in its history.    These rules will cost billions of dollars, place a heavy burden on American families, and diminish the ability of American businesses to compete around the world. EPA's political agenda is to rearrange the American economy, instituting ``command and control'' by the Obama Administration.    This Committee's investigations have revealed an EPA that intentionally chooses to ignore good science. EPA cherry-picks the science that fits its agenda and ignores the science that does not support its position. When the science falls short, the EPA resorts to a propaganda campaign designed to mislead the public.    Today's hearing will examine this unprecedented regulatory agenda and the manner in which the EPA has used suspect science, questionable legal interpretations, and flawed analysis to justify these regulations. A glaring example is the President's so-called Clean Power Plan. This plan is nothing more than a ``Power Grab'' to give the government more control over Americans' daily lives.    This regulation stifles economic growth, destroys American jobs, and increases energy prices. That means costs will rise-from electricity to gasoline to food, disproportionately hurting low-income Americans. Even EPA data shows that this regulation would reduce sea level rise by only 1/100 of an inch, the thickness of three sheets of paper. The Clean Power Plan represents massive costs without significant benefits. In other words, it's all pain and no gain.    The President used this regulation as the cornerstone of his agenda at the Paris climate talks. The Paris agreement is a bad deal for the American people that will shrink our economy without any recognized benefit. Even if all 177 countries meet their promised reductions of carbon emissions for the next 85 years, that will reduce temperatures by only one-sixth of one degree Celsius. That is incredible.    For almost two years, the Committee requested to see the data EPA uses to justify Clean Air Act regulations. The EPA's refusal to provide all the data led the Science Committee to issue its first subpoena in 21 years to retrieve that information, and we are still waiting. What is the Obama Administration hiding?    The Committee's investigation and oversight of the EPA's development of the Waters of the U.S. rule has revealed troubling and illegal agency activities. During the course of our investigation, the Committee found that the EPA engaged in inappropriate tactics to generate grassroots lobbying in support of this rule.    This past December, the Government Accountability Organization issued a legal opinion that found that EPA violated both the Anti-Lobbying and Anti-Deficiency Acts.    The EPA's relationship with activist environmental groups and use of questionable science does not end there. The Committee's investigation of the Agency's decision to embark on a premature and unprecedented decision to stop the Pebble Mine has shown that career EPA officials acted with blatant bias to determine the outcome. Also, these same officials intentionally used personal email to prevent the Committee and the EPA Inspector General from discovering the extent of their incriminating actions. This is just another unfortunate example of the EPA allowing politics rather than science to drive its agenda.    Earlier this Congress, the House approved H.R. 1030, the Secret Science Reform Act. This legislation requires the EPA to base its regulations on publicly available data. Why would the EPA want to hide this data from the American people? Because either the data is science fiction or it doesn't exist.    During the last year, several of EPA's major regulations have been halted by federal courts. These include the Agency's efforts to stop the Pebble Mine, the controversial Waters of the U.S. rule, and the Clean Power Plan. Many of these regulations trample on the constitutional rights of individuals and rely on suspect legal interpretations of the law.    I hope the Administrator will tell us today how she intends to follow the law in writing regulations and when she will provide the American people with the data and other information that this committee has requested.    Chairman Smith. That concludes my opening statement, and the Ranking Member, the gentlewoman from Texas, Eddie Bernice Johnson, is recognized for hers.    Chairman Smith. Thank you, Ms. Johnson.    Our witness today is the Honorable Gina McCarthy, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Prior to her appointment as Administrator, she was the Assistant Administrator for EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. She also has served as the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. During her career, which spans over 30 years, she has worked at both the state and local levels on environmental issues and helped coordinate policies on energy, transportation, and the environment.    Administrator McCarthy received a bachelor of arts degree in social anthropology from the University of Massachusetts and a master's of science and environmental health, engineering, and planning from Tufts University.    We welcome you, Administrator, and look forward to your testimony.           TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE GINA McCARTHY,    Chairman Smith. Okay. Thank you, Administrator McCarthy. And I'll recognize myself for questions.    The first is this. The nonpartisan Energy Information Administration at the Department of Energy has found that the Clean Power Plan will reduce economic growth, increase electricity costs, and result in almost 400,000 jobs lost over the next 15 years. And all this is with very little impact on climate change itself. So why has the Obama Administration imposed this regulation on the American people?    Chairman Smith. Right. So you----    Chairman Smith. Okay. But--so you disagree with the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy?    Chairman Smith. Okay----    Chairman Smith. --real quickly, let me repeat my question----    Chairman Smith. --to make sure you----    Chairman Smith. --address it. They said it would reduce economic growth, increase electricity cost, and cost almost 400,000 jobs in the next 15 years. This is the Department of Energy. This is this Administration. This is the Energy Information Administration. So do you agree or disagree with their conclusions?    Chairman Smith. Okay. It's clear you disagree with the Administration. I happen to think they're probably less biased than the EPA, and I think their conclusions that were reached probably represent closer to the facts, but we're going to have to agree----    Chairman Smith. --to disagree on that.    Chairman Smith. Okay. You are not familiar with the Energy Information Administration or you are?    Chairman Smith. Okay. Have you read their----    Chairman Smith. --report on the Clean Power Plan?    Chairman Smith. Okay. And you disagree with that?    Chairman Smith. Okay.    Chairman Smith. Well, again, reduce economic growth, increase electricity costs, and cost 400,000 jobs----    Chairman Smith. --over the next 15 years.    Chairman Smith. Okay.    Chairman Smith. It's nice to have the Administration at war with itself. I'll go to my----    Chairman Smith. --next question. If the Paris climate agreement involving 177 countries was completely implemented, okay, the entire climate agreement completely implemented, you have distinguished scientists including Bjorn Lomborg and 27 other top climate scientists, including three Nobel laureates, who have concluded that the reduction in global warming would only be one-twentieth of a degree Celsius by 2030, one-sixth of a degrees Celsius in the next 85 years. It sounds to me like if they're anywhere close to being right, then this Paris Climate Agreement is almost all pain and no gain. Why is that not the case?    Chairman Smith. Do you disagree that----    Chairman Smith. Do you think the Paris Climate Agreement will have a greater impact on climate change than I just said and that these 27 scientists said?    Chairman Smith. Well, I understand----    Chairman Smith. --as far as the actual impact on climate change, do you disagree with these 27 top----    Chairman Smith. --climate scientists?    Chairman Smith. No, no----    Chairman Smith. Those are----    Chairman Smith. I know those are wonderful words----    Chairman Smith. I'm talking about quantifying the impact. The impact is one-sixth of a degree over the next 85 years if every country, all 177 countries----    Chairman Smith. --implement it----    Chairman Smith. Okay.    Chairman Smith. But you don't disagree with the conclusion----    Chairman Smith. --of these scientists as far as the climate agreement goes in Paris----    Chairman Smith. --as it stands right now?    Chairman Smith. I understand.    Chairman Smith. I understand but----    Chairman Smith. --as far as the step forward goes----    Chairman Smith. --the step forward is as I described it.    Chairman Smith. Okay. It's clear you don't disagree with their conclusion. You may think it's a beginning, but you can't disagree----    Chairman Smith. --with their conclusion?    Chairman Smith. Again----    Chairman Smith. --it's reducing global warming one-sixth of a degrees Celsius over the next 85 years.    Chairman Smith. One-sixth for all----    Chairman Smith. It all sounds to me----    Chairman Smith. --like it's all pain and no gain, and I think that's--why punish the American people if we're not going to have any significant impact on climate change?    Chairman Smith. Let me tell you, increase electricity costs, slow economic growth, and lost jobs is punishment----    Chairman Smith. --for the American people.    Chairman Smith. All right.    Chairman Smith. Okay. It's you against all these other scientists----    Chairman Smith. --and that's okay. My next question is this. With out major environmental regulations, we have seen reduction in carbon emissions in the United States through technological breakthroughs. For example, in the last 11 years there's been a 12 percent reduction in energy-related carbon emissions in the United States.    Rather than impose costly government mandates and interfere with free market, why not encourage more technological advances that will reduce the cost of alternative fuels and so encourage their use? In other words, you're not going to convince developing countries to go to alternative forms of energy if you don't reduce the cost. It's not good for them; it's not good for their economy. So why not allow technology breakthroughs to solve the problem as they have throughout the history of the United States? Why engage in these government mandates to skew the market, cost jobs, and are burdensome to the American people?    Chairman Smith. Government mandates don't skew the market----    Chairman Smith. --and subsidies don't skew the market?    Chairman Smith. Well----    Chairman Smith. --why not let the market work?    Chairman Smith. Why not--why impose the regulation? Why not let market work? It's going the right direction.    Chairman Smith. Okay. I think we're a democratic country, and the free market, if allowed to work, will work as it has been working. I'm just sorry that government wants to interfere with that. And that's going beyond my time by a minute. And the Ranking Member from--is--the Ranking Member is recognized for her questions.    Chairman Smith. Thank you, Ms. Johnson. Well, yield to me?
