    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for holding this hearing. I find this very interesting. I think the focus of what you have heard a lot is China, what are we going to do to deal with China in terms of the pressure that China has. To me, there are a couple of questions I would like to understand before we get into what we have to do to press China, or to do anything else; that is, what does China want? Where is China at this--not because of our pressure.    Two, I have seen over the past year or so some articles, especially in the New York Times, about Chinese officials, former military officials, retired, talking about the unsustainability of the Kim regime, and that there is a real concern in China about instability in North Korea. I would like to hear that discussion, that there is going to be pressure from the bottom up. People cannot live under those conditions, and the Chinese know this. The Chinese know, and there are real worries about the Chinese, about what that instability is going to lead to in terms of them.    So that leads us to the third point; that is, when we talk about China, knowing that China--it is not getting China involved. China is very involved with what are the consequences. It may have its own agenda about what it wants to do with this. The question is, besides pressure on China--and we have heard a lot, and I am not saying that that is not a potential--what are the ways of partnership with China? What do you see as the opportunities at this moment to be dealing with?    Thank you very much, and I yield back.
