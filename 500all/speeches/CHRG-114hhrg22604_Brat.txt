    Mr. Brat. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have to go testify on health savings accounts, but I just wanted to ask one quick question, and it will be suggestive, and then I have got to run out.    But a lot of times up here we talk economic growth, and then you get the usual pattern of political responses tied to government programs that already exist instead of going back to first principles and what causes economic growth in the first place, and then asking yourself, are you in the ballpark on those fundamentals or are we just making up kind of new clever things that are trendy politically and trying to hit those in the short run.    So we mentioned R&D, NIH funding, preschool initiatives, infrastructure. So those are examples of the in-vogue kind of things, right? Obama has been doing infrastructure for 7 years and the economy has grown at 1 percent the last couple quarters. So I am unconvinced.    Sand in the gears, I think we are all agreed on that. The regs are huge, and how we overcome that is tremendously large.    So I just want to ask you, if you go back to economic theory from scratch, give me just your top three causes of economic growth, the three variables on the right-hand side of an equation, in order, right, starting with number one, the number one proximate cause of economic growth, number two, number three. If they are cultural, if they are capital, if they are traditional economics, I don't care. But just give me your top three, what do you got.    Why don't you start off, Dr. Cochrane?    Mr. Brat. Good.    Yep, Jared. Sorry, Dr. Bernstein.    Mr. Brat. Good.    Mr. Brat. Good. The immigration, in 30 seconds, I will just say, south of the border immigration, average tenth-grade education level on the human capital side. I am not aware of any growth studies that show average person at the Federal level, welfare benefits $37,000 a year, according to Heritage, $26,000 a year if you have got two kids in school. Productivity growth is low.    But let me go back to my first series of questions. So I love the ideas, right? One of my favorite economists, Chicago, I am going to blank on her name, virtue, she is the virtue one. Anyway, going on to your thing----    Mr. Brat. Yeah. Deirdre, right.    To get at this, what should the Federal Government be doing if we wanted to think way outside of the box, not at the margin, the margin is not working? What do we do to really reinvigorate the private sector in a big way using the limited tools we have right now?    Mr. Brat. Yeah.    Mr. Brat. Right. No, that is correct, right.    Dr. Bernstein.    Mr. Brat. Yep. Good. And then, Doctor.    And I will just say, we have got $2 trillion in regulatory overreach that has been categorized already.    Mr. Brat. Right. Got you.    Doctor, 5 seconds.    Mr. Brat. Right. I know that well.    Mr. Brat. That is it. Good. Thank you all very much. Sorry to run.
