    Ms. Delbene. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks to all of you for being here with us today. Many of you have talked about the efforts of finding and using evidence in the SNAP Program, and in my State of Washington, we have already developed a number of effective strategies to help families achieve self-sufficiency. Washington's employment and training program has helped over 11,000 people find jobs, and in one study less than \1/2\ of those enrolled in the program remain on government assistance 2 years after they enrolled. So Washington's program has been a model, and we used it as a model to help create the ten employment and training pilots that were in the farm bill.    I was wondering, Mr. Weill, if you can explain further how employment and training programs might be able to help us develop further strategies to help expand opportunity, and make sure that we reduce hunger at the same time.    Ms. Delbene. I also wanted to follow up on something you mentioned in your testimony. You talked about the primary goals of SNAP being addressing hunger and malnutrition, assisting households obtain a more nutritious diet, strengthening the agricultural economy, and doing so through normal channels of trade. Can you elaborate on what the research tells us about how SNAP is meeting those goals today?    Ms. Delbene. And what else should we be studying? Do you have other ideas on things we aren't looking at today that we should be looking at?    Ms. Delbene. Thank you. I will yield back.    The Chairwoman. Thank you. The chair recognizes Mr. Yoho, for 5 minutes.
