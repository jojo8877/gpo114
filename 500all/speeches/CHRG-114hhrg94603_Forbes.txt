    Mr. Forbes. Mr. Chairman, thank you.    One aspect of the proposed transfer that we have not talked about in this Committee but has received attention in the House Armed Services Committee on which I serve is what happens to the .mil and .gov top-level domains? Even though .mil and .gov are used by the U.S. military, first responders, and Federal and state government agencies, the U.S. Government may not actually own those domains. So I would like to ask Mr. Corwin and Mr. DelBianco whether you agree that a reasonable condition of the IANA transition should include a written agreement that the U.S. Government has an exclusive, perpetual, no-cost right to those domains.    Mr. Forbes. Good.    Mr. Corwin?    Mr. Forbes. Good. Thank you.    Ms. Stark and Mr. Misener, I am not sure if I will be able to get this question in my time, but if you were to visit ICANN's Web site and read the description for the Government Advisory Committee, it states: ``The GAC is not a decision-making body. However, there are growing concerns regarding the GAC's influence over ICANN's multi-stakeholder process.''    As representatives who are involved in the multi-stakeholder process at ICANN, can you shed some light on any notable examples where the GAC has interfered in the multi-stakeholder process which directly impacted your company or your respective companies? And what can be done to curb the growing influence of the GAC over the ICANN board of directors? And what type of unintended consequences do you think the IANA transition will have on the GAC?    Either one of you can get that. I only have about 60 seconds.    Mr. Forbes. Ms. Stark, anything you would like to add?    Mr. Forbes. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and I yield back.
