    Mr. Hice. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Fallon, do you have any idea how the VA is recruiting qualified veterans for this study?    Mr. Hice. Correct.    Mr. Hice. Okay. Is there currently a waiting list of qualified veterans who would like to participate?    Mr. Hice. How large is the waiting list?    Mr. Hice. And this is at one facility or ----    Mr. Hice. Okay. So are you saying that the personnel at VA medical centers are aware of this study and are actively engaged in informing veterans of the potential of having a service dog?    Mr. Hice. Does the VA currently have any way to gauge the demand for the service dogs?    Mr. Hice. Is that under consideration?    Mr. Hice. Mr. Diamond, let me come to you. How are qualified veterans referred to your organization?    Mr. Hice. So you don't do any advertising per se. It is all word-of-mouth?    Mr. Hice. All right. That is my point. That is where I was going. So the VA doesn't seem to have a whole lot of information here. Of course, this has not been their program. But you are actively involved in providing service dogs to veterans, and you have a 2-year waiting list. I mean, do you have any way of gauging what the need is?    Mr. Hice. Sure. Absolutely.    Mr. Lyle, let me ask you--and first of all, thank you for your service and for your testimony. Both are powerful, and we deeply and in a heartfelt way say thank you for what you have done for our country.    How did you find out that service dogs were an option for     Mr. Hice. Okay. So your introduction came through a personal friend?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Mr. Diamond, let me come back to you, and my time is almost up. Twofold question, do you find that veterans struggle with affording service dogs as a general rule? And how does your organization enable them to pair up?    Mr. Hice. Very good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
