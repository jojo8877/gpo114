    Mr. Welch. Well, I can't match your lyrics, but I can agree with everything you have said and my colleague, Mr. Latta. You know, the Department of Energy does really good stuff, and I actually think standards are a very important tool. But we also have to have it match what realistically can be done in order to get the benefit of demand response. And there are a lot of homes that have these water heaters that are going to benefit, and this is going to save folks money. So the regulation I think has to have as a goal the maximum deployment and the maximum energy efficiency. And I think that is what is uniting us in this effort here.    I am like Congressman Latta. The local cooperatives are fantastic and really a lifeline for a lot of our citizens in rural areas. And homeowners are doing everything they can to try to save money on their bills. They need an opportunity. They know that less is more if they can save some money. And then when they have their cooperative working with them in this demand response that actually integrates this opportunity of savings with the technology that people actually have in their homes, let us take advantage of it.    So this is great bipartisan legislation, and I am hopeful that we can get this done. And I appreciate, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, your cooperation on this in leading the committee. Thank you. I yield back.    Mr. Welch. I yield to Mr. Loebsack. Thank you.
