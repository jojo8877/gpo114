    Ms. Walsh. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll--I have a brief opening statement on behalf of my intelligence community colleagues in the interest of brevity.    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cummings, and members of the committee, my name is Deirdre Walsh, and I serve as Director of Legislative Affairs for the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. I'm here in response to the committee's request to answer questions about the recent document production by the FBI to Congress related to former Secretary of State Clinton's email.    While I understand the Intelligence Community Inspector General, or ICIG as we refer to him, may have interacted with the inner agency with regard to these documents, by statute, the ICIG maintains its own interactions with the Congress separate from my office. Accordingly, I cannot speak on behalf of the ICIG.    With regard to the documents produced by the FBI and the subject of this hearing, ODNI was not involved with this document production. I will, however, do my best to answer any of the questions that you may have.    Additionally, I'm joined by my colleagues from the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Agency in response to the committee's request. Given the classification of the underlying material, we look forward to discussing sensitive matters in the closed portion of the hearing. Thank you for the opportunity.    Ms. Walsh. Not to my knowledge.    Ms. Walsh. About her use of a private server, sir?    Ms. Walsh. No, sir.    Ms. Walsh. Given that that's outside my role in Legislative Affairs, I'd have to take that back.    Ms. Walsh. We'll do our best. It's the best I'm going to say. We'll do our best.    Ms. Walsh. Sure.
