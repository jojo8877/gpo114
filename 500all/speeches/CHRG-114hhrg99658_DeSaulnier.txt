    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.    Director, first, I want to join the positive comments about your management. It is really a relief to hear it off of, as the chairman said in his opening comments, some of the other hearings we have had and the difficulty of what would seem like just commonsense management leadership.    But I wanted to, besides congratulating you and thanking you, talk about a specific program that you have developed--it is my understanding you developed--that Mr. Russell sort of mentioned, the alcohol awareness campaign.    Could you just walk the committee through how--what was the genesis of you developing the campaign and, sort of, what the campaign does for prevention and intervention and then the testing protocol that would be able to intervene after you have done the prevention and intervention?    Mr. DeSaulnier. Do you think there are lessons learned, from your experience, that should be shared either with your sister agencies in the Federal Government or with public safety in general?    Mr. DeSaulnier. I appreciate your work.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
