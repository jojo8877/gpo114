    Ms. Matsui. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding Mr. Pallone's time to me. First of all, let me say FirstNet is a startup, let us not forget that. Like every startup, it has had its growing pains. For so long there were questions on how FirstNet would be funded, but now we know that it was fully funded, and will be operational, due to this subcommittee's diligent work on AWS-3's record setting spectrum auction. Last year FirstNet laid out a road map, and I am pleased that they are hitting their milestones so far.    From the beginning I remained focused on the need for a strong governance structure at FirstNet to responsibly govern any nationwide public safety interoperability network. Despite some initial concerns about the role of States taking a back seat, I am pleased that the FirstNet board took this issue head on and developed a strong coordinated relationship with the States. It is my hope that we can work together in a bipartisan manner to achieve success for America's first responders. And I yield to anyone on my side who would like to take the rest of the time. No? I yield back the balance of my time.
