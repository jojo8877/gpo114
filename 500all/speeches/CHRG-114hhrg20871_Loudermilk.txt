    Mr. Loudermilk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Bigot, you mentioned in your testimony that not only is ITER building a first-of-its-kind reactor but the organizational structure is first of kind--first of its kind. If you could go back and restructure the organization, would you do anything different, and if so, what would it be?    Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. Dr. Prager, did you want to--I didn't know if you were--you had something to add.    Mr. Loudermilk. Okay.    Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. Well, Dr. Bigot, are you considering requesting any changes to the organizational structure going forward?    Mr. Loudermilk. Right.    Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. Well, thank you.    Dr. Prager, fusion energy has often been described as being 50 years away. What do we know now that we didn't know ten to fifteen years ago that will give us the confidence that we are making some progress?    Mr. Loudermilk. Okay.    Mr. Loudermilk. Well, thank you. I'm out of time so, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
