    Mr. Carney. And Congresswoman, this is kind of about readiness also. And not just readiness for the Active Force, but also the Reserve Force.    As a reservist who did not have good access to a TRICARE plan--it wasn't called TRICARE for us. It was called ``try to find care.'' And that affects readiness. If you are not medically ready, definitely ready, you are not going to be ready to fight the Nation's wars. So this access is also about readiness.    Mr. Carney. Mr. Chairman, if I might----    Mr. Carney. I am the father of a lance corporal who is now making a few bucks. And his question to me was dad, what do you know about Ford F-250s? I said I know you can't afford them.    But these kids are out there making these kinds of decisions all the time. And you know how paternalistic do we want to be is kind of the question. And it is not really a paternalism question.    It is a readiness question. Because a lot of these kids get in financial difficulty and they lose clearances if they have them. Or they deploy and they know they have financial trouble at home and that is on their mind when they are forward. And that is the kind of stuff we are trying to get away from here.    Mr. Carney. So one of the things we recommend is altering the LES to reflect what they are getting and what the projected is. Sort of like when you get your Social Security thing every year, if you stayed until 70, that kind of thing. So it gives them some more financial awareness. And also we want to include the families in the financial literacy as well.    Mr. Carney. But it is also critical that they have the robust financial education so they make the decisions with it. And that is a big chunk of one of our recommendations, certainly. And it is a big part of all of this. It ties together.
