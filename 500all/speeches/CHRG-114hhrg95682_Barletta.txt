    Mr. Barletta. Thank you, Madam Chair.    The primary objective of the Immigration Advisory and Joint Security Programs are to stop potential terrorists and other high-risk passengers from boarding aircrafts and entering the United States. But under these programs, the no-board recommendations made by CBP Officers are only voluntary.    Mr. Wagner, can you speak to the frequency with which CBP's recommendations under these programs are followed? In light of the growing threat of the Islamic State, are there any plans to make these recommendations have more force or to otherwise implement additional measures to prevent foreign fighters from boarding planes to the United States?    Mr. Barletta. Sure. We know that those wishing to do us harm have manipulated our immigration systems in the past to enter and remain in the United States. Indeed the 9/11 Commission noted that for terrorists travel documents are as important as weapons. Mahmud Abouhalima, a convicted perpetrator of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, received amnesty in 1986 after he claimed to be an agricultural worker, despite being a cab driver. The only thing he planted in America was a bomb.    How would you rank the effectiveness, Mr. Wagner, of the programs discussed here today at preventing another Mahmud Abouhalima from obtaining or using travel documents to carry out an attack against the United States? Are there some that you think do a better job at meeting this goal? How would you improve those that are less than effective?    Mr. Barletta. Thank you.    Thank you, Madam Chair.
