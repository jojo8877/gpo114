    Mr. Bishop. Thank you. I appreciate that.    And, General, I would like to follow up on the line that Mr. Wilson was giving. I have the same concern about MOX, I am just not as civil as he is. But in both versions of the NDAA that was passed last year, including the one that was signed by your boss, it does clearly say that you shall carry out construction and project-support activities relating to the MOX Facility. And the 3119 section to which Representative Wilson referred does clearly say that you have to include those budget justification materials submitted to Congress in support of the DOE budget for fiscal year 2017 and that updated performance line. It is not an option.    So I do have questions. I haven't seen that baseline either. You admit that it is not there. But how are you now disregarding the direction that was given you in the bill, in the law, and terminating this project? How can you respond to that?    General Klotz. Well, first of all, on the construction, we understand in the 2016 Authorization, Appropriations Acts, we are to continue construction. We will continue construction through the end of 2016. And our proposal, of course, in the fiscal year 2017 budget is to terminate the program. And the reason that we make that argument is because the several studies that we have done over the past 2 years indicate that there is a much faster, much cheaper way to dispose of this. The costs of----    Mr. Bishop. Then let me interrupt with that one, because if there is indeed a cheaper way, a cheaper technology, it is not necessarily a proven technology. You have given us no specific cost estimates. There is no methodology of that. I mean, you haven't given us the data that you need to do before you go in that direction.    It seems to me that once again the administration is clearly bypassing the intent of Congress and not giving us the data that was required before you make that change in direction. You have no ability to close this facility.    General Klotz. Well, the technology and the process by which we do it is proven. There is already close to 5----    Mr. Bishop. Have you submitted that to us?    General Klotz . 5 metric tons of diluted plutonium currently in the facility at WIPP. So we know how to do that.    Mr. Bishop. But, General, that has to be part of the baseline you submit to us. That is the decision we get a chance to make here. And I think this committee has spoken several times over the past few years about the direction we expect you to go in that.    General Klotz. Congressman, you are absolutely right. This is the proposal of the administration in our fiscal year 2017 budget proposal. We recognize, as I used to say when I taught political science, the President proposes and the Congress disposes. This is our proposal.    Mr. Bishop. Would you have that printed and given to some other people within the administration?    Could you also, though, recognize this? Will there be a stop-work order coming from any of the organizations here on this project before Congress gets to once again reaffirm what we want you to do?    General Klotz. We discussed this just before coming over here. What I have been told by my staff is we will continue construction all the way through fiscal year 2016 as laid out by the direction of Congress.    Mr. Bishop. Will there be a stop-work proposal after that?    General Klotz. I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. Let me get back to you on that.    Mr. Bishop. I appreciate that. But I once again would like to reaffirm, I think you have seen the direction that Congress has given in last year's NDAA. Any deviation from that would be problematic at best.    I will yield back.    General Klotz. I take your point.    Mr. Bishop. This committee acted through the NDAA to ensure that it is better informed about the authorization for export of critical nuclear technologies. The February 25 deadline for the administration to notify to Congress a list of those technologies is almost upon us. Will the administration be in compliance?    General Klotz. The Department of Energy has prepared, in consultation with the Departments of State, Commerce, and Defense, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Director of National Intelligence, a list of technologies that should be protected from diversion to a military program in those countries that are considered a ``covered foreign country'' in Section 3136 of the FY 2016 NDAA.    In order to develop this list of technologies, the Department and the consulting agencies considered what possible contribution would be made to a nuclear weapon or naval propulsion program if such technology or assistance was diverted from a peaceful intent to a military program. The Department is finalizing this list and its submission to Congress and will be prepared to brief Congress on the results of our consultations.    The Department is also working to revise its 10 CFR Part 810 application review process to ensure that for any application that comes forward for a listed technology to a ``covered foreign country,'' the appropriate notifications are made to Congress in accordance with the NDAA. Finally, the Department also is developing a process to ensure that the list of technologies remains up to date and addresses technological developments within the nuclear industry and the nuclear weapon and naval propulsion capabilities of the ``covered foreign countries.''    Mr. Bishop. Maximizing U.S. influence on global nuclear safety, security and nonproliferation is a concern of this Committee, and we cannot achieve this goal without an effective and efficient nuclear export authorization process. What is the status of the DOE's Process Improvement Program for nuclear technology exports under Part 810?    General Klotz. In February 2015, the Department concluded a three-year comprehensive revision of its regulations at 10 CFR Part 810 (Part 810), governing the transfer of nuclear technology and assistance abroad and to foreign persons. The revised Part 810 regulation clarifies and streamlines the authorization process to reflect the pace of nuclear commerce, while continuing to address proliferation risks associated with nuclear technology transfer. DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) currently is implementing a Part 810 Process Improvement Plan (PIP) and e810 online authorization system to further improve and modernize the Part 810 application and U.S. interagency review process.    As a part of the PIP, NNSA has committed to make the Part 810 program compliant with ISO 9001, which includes a continuous improvement program. NNSA already has implemented a number of actions intended to improve and expedite the review process, including: a new docketing procedure; issuing specific authorizations conditional on subsequent receipt of foreign assurances; and developing a procedure to use Atomic Energy Act (AEA) Section 57b.1 for foreign assurances for China. This action will eliminate the need to secure government-to-government assurances for specific transfers authorized under the U.S.-China 123 Agreement; instead, those transfers will be covered by the assurances of the 123 Agreement. This not only eliminates the most time-consuming element of securing a specific authorization, but places those technology transfers under the stronger nonproliferation assurances of the 123 Agreement. Other areas identified in the PIP that the Department continues to work on and will implement over the next weeks and months include: improving process and data management; reforming and publishing in the Federal Register a new U.S. interagency process for 810 reviews; revising internal DOE review procedures to reduce time in process; improving assistance to exporters with more on-line guidance and technical resources; more enforcement and compliance monitoring of Part 810 reporting by U.S. persons; and considering implementing a risk-based application review approach.                                 ______
