    Ms. Chu. Thank you. Ms. Felder, I understand that there has been uptick in number of design patents that the auto industries have filed over the years. In addition, companies like Ford began filing infringement complaints at the International Trade Commission. The complaints were filed against aftermarket suppliers of collision repair parts for popular and iconic cars like the F-150 and the Mustang. What are the outcomes of these cases, and how have they affected the overall market? Is it more difficult to find aftermarket parts for these cars today compared to years past?    Ms. Chu. Yes.    Ms. Chu. And you have stated that your own company cease and desist letters from a number of car companies who warned you of your infringement liability risk if you continue with your business. How did you react when you received these warnings, and what are you doing to address them?    Ms. Chu. Okay. Thank you, and Mr. Gillis, you are urging Congress to address the automakers misuse of design patents on their crash replacement parts. Can you explain how you believe design patents are being misused by the auto industry?    Ms. Chu. Okay. Thank you. Well, if I could have Ms. Burris respond to the same thing?    Ms. Chu. Well, of this claim that design patents are being misused.    Ms. Chu. Thank you. I yield back.
