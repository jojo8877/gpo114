    Mr. Abraham. Thank you, Madam Chairman, for having this great hearing, and I want to thank the witnesses for giving direct answers to direct questions. That's refreshing and somewhat of a novel idea in a Committee hearing, so kudos to you guys for answering straight up. We appreciate that.    Some of you have espoused the value of sharing cybersecurity information whether it be a cyber threat tread or a cyber crime with certainly other companies or government officials. This last cybersecurity bill that we passed last month, did that help or hurt in this area?    Mr. Abraham. So we need to do more is what you're saying?    Mr. Abraham. And just give me your top three recommendations. What would be your bullet points for the new legislation?    Mr. Abraham. Very enlightening. Any you guys want to comment anything else?    Mr. Abraham. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I yield back.    Chairwoman Comstock. Okay. And I will now recognize Mr. Hultgren for his fiv minutes.
