    Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank each of you for being here before us today and for the information that you're going to share with us and work with us.    I appreciate this series that the chairman has put in place, the Disruptor Series, because we do live in a time when you're going to see the Internet of things, if you will, begin to move forward and become more enmeshed with our daily lives--how we do business, how our military protects ourselves, how consumers use a product in recreation.    All of those are components that we are going to be tasked with dealing with the issues and the implications.    Now, we're looking at privacy. We're looking at safety, the utilizations and also we want to look at the mechanism--the drone itself--and then what you put on the drone, which is where you get into the privacy concerns and utilization of technology that can be a little bit invasive, if you will.    But we do know that there is an enormous curiosity about these and such a desire to have a drone and play with a drone. I say I have a family full of big kids ranging from age 60 on down to age 6, all male, by the way.    And they love all of these gadgets and toys and the next new thing and they so like--yes, I hear you all chuckling. I do think that my husband is still a big kid and but there is such a fascination with this and the policy implications of that come to us--how do you encourage that curiosity, how do you allow consumer use, how do you allow commercial use and still look at the safety and security. And, of course, as we have found out with our airplanes and with air travel make certain that we are securing that space.    So thank you for your information and your wisdom. We appreciate having you here. Yield back.
