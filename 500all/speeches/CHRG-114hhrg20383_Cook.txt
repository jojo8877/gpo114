    Mr. Cook. Thank you, Judge. You are absolutely correct.    Mr. Keller, if I were President of the United States, heaven forbid, but if I said to you, what do you think, one, two, or three, are the top countries, state-sponsored aid, financial aid, to ISIS or ISIL or Daesh, whatever you want to call them, who would you name, one, two, or three? Just briefly.    Mr. Cook. Real brief.    Mr. Cook. No, no. Just in your opinion, your opinion, I am asking you as the President of the United States, one, two, or three, who do you think they are?    Mr. Cook. Okay. Okay.    Mr. Cook. Okay.    Then let's go back to what you were commenting on about Turkey. And I have a different impression of Turkey because of Erdogan. I have some issues with the--I understand the war against the PKK, but I am also concerned about what they are doing to the rest of the Kurds, which is one of our allies against ISIS.    And it is almost like, are we overlooking that, that some people--particularly with Erdogan leaning toward the Muslim Brotherhood. Could you address that briefly? Real briefly. I am running out of time.    Mr. Cook. Okay.    Then let me move on to Hamas. Is Hamas helping them out with financing, ISIS?    Mr. Cook. So there is--okay.    Mr. Glaser, did you want to comment on that, about the situation in Turkey, where, you know, a number of months ago, there were--that they were, you know, helping out with the oil and everything like that with ISIS. Any comments on that at all in the intel sector?    Mr. Cook. Yeah. You don't want to answer my question about one, two, or three?    Mr. Cook. And I am just a dumb Marine, so I have to ask simple answers.    Mr. Cook. No, I agree with you on that.    Mr. Cook. Okay. And you are not worried about states such as Qatar or some of the Gulf states at all that are involved with states that are sponsoring ISIS?    Mr. Cook. Okay. Thank you.    I yield back.
