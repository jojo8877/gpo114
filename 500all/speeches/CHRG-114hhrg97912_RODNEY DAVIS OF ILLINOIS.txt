    Mr. RODNEY DAVIS OF ILLINOIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for letting us, poor Ag Committee members come into such a nice spacious committee room. We know how good you have it here on Ways and Means now.    Mr. RODNEY DAVIS OF ILLINOIS. I am not yielding back. Actually, I just want to welcome my friend, Mr. Randolph, from the great State of Illinois. It was nice, my colleague, Mr. McGovern, was interesting in some of the policies that are being implemented in Illinois, and I can't wait to have that discussion with him in a future hearing.    I appreciate your work and your discussion on the cliff that you are talking about. As somebody who is a supporter of SNAP programs, I want to make sure that those who need benefits get them and that those who are on those benefits have the ability to transition into that workplace and not have to make a decision between getting benefits or getting a higher wage.    You have talked about the cliff, now I want to hear some of your suggestions that we might be able to take into consideration in this institution on how to make it better. What can we do to fix it? So I would ask you that. What can we do to fix some of the problems that you have identified?    Mr. RODNEY DAVIS OF ILLINOIS. No. Go ahead.    Mr. RODNEY DAVIS OF ILLINOIS. What are a couple of examples that you can give as to how they are managing those programs better? What can we do in a State like Illinois to do exactly what you are talking about?    Mr. RODNEY DAVIS OF ILLINOIS. Great. My time has expired. I will yield back my one second. But I look forward to working with you, Mr. Randolph.
