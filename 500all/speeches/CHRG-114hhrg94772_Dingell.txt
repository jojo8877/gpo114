    Mrs. Dingell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to all of our witnesses today.    I want to take a step backward from the discussion that we have been having, because I think despite some of the tension in the room, I really think that there is some agreement about the importance of protecting the greater sage grouse and the significant role that the bird plays in local ecosystems and economies.    I, like you, have never seen the sage grouse; but I am married to a man that has, and knows its importance. So, I think I want to go back, if I can get through my questions, to ask you a question about the original intent of the Endangered Species Act. But first, I would like--because we do have different views and ideas about how to get there--I would like to explore that a bit further.    Dr. Arnett, I found your testimony very interesting, at 2:00 a.m. this morning, as you tried to bring the Federal and the state level together. I think everyone in this room wants to avoid a listing of the greater sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act. What do you think the best way to accomplish that is?    Mrs. Dingell. So your testimony, your written and your oral here, talks about the partnership between the state and the Federal level. Yet the testimony and discussion we have heard this morning--and in the written last night--alleges the states have not been involved in the process.    Can you give us background, and maybe expand a little on the role that state agencies have played in that effort? Again, as you just said, the critical role of both of them playing together, can the Federal not be involved in any way? How would that work? Do you agree that the states haven't been, and that they are the best in--it is really a difference of opinion between the two of you sitting next to each other.
