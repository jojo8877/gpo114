    Mr. Poe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you all for being here.    I am embarrassed about this whole situation. It is embarrassing. It is embarrassing to the country.    I am a former criminal court judge. I know a lot of peace officers. And like has been said, generally speaking, peace officers do the work nobody else would do. I respect them a great deal. And this conduct that has been discussed here today is not so much a reflection on the rest of us, but it hurts good peace officers throughout the country, those that work at the DEA, Secret Service, and state agencies, because too many want to classify all of them based upon the conduct of a few here.    But the ones, from what I hear, it seems like some believe in this system that the rule is for thee but not for me, and they are not held accountable for what they do as other people in the country would be held accountable for.    So, Mr. Whaley, just based upon looking at you, you seem to be a little embarrassed about this whole situation. Is that a fair statement?    Mr. Poe. I mean, it is tough work. They are all over the world. They are working undercover. Nobody knows what they are doing for the good of this country, and here we have a few that have hurt the reputation really of the whole agency.    I have questions for both you and Mr. Hughes. I will ask you first. Mr. Hughes, I want to ask you the same questions.    Let's use 2013, or 2014. Maybe you got those. How many complaints have been filed against DEA agents in 2014?    Mr. Poe. That is fine, allegations. Of those allegations, how many did you determine, your agency determine were bona fide allegations?    Mr. Poe. Well, why not?    Mr. Poe. One hundred and sixty.    Mr. Poe. Okay, 160. How many of those in 160 were disciplined by being fired?    Mr. Poe. Any?    Mr. Poe. Five?    Mr. Poe. Would you be surprised--I mean, you don't know what number it is.    Mr. Poe. Okay. How many of them went to jail, were prosecuted and went to jail?    Mr. Poe. How many?    Mr. Poe. Mr. Roth, do you know?    Mr. Poe. Mr. Horowitz?    Mr. Poe. Okay. I want the answer.    Mr. Poe. Mr. Hughes, the same questions. In 2014, how many allegations, complaints, by any source, were made against a Secret Service agent?    Mr. Poe. All right. Would that include all the complaints, even the unfounded ones? That is what I am asking you, all the complaints made against Secret Service agents.    Mr. Poe. So you don't know how many complaints were made by any source.    Mr. Poe. But you can find out the number of allegations.    Mr. Poe. Somewhere along the system, those were removed, and you had how many bona fide accusations?    Mr. Poe. How many of those 100 were fired?    Mr. Poe. How many went to jail for criminal violations?    Mr. Poe. Nobody went to jail.    Mr. Poe. Were any of those--well, how many people were prosecuted?    Mr. Poe. So, what were the allegations? Can you give us a list of the allegations that were found to be bona fide by the Secret Service of that 100-plus?    Mr. Poe. And nobody went to jail.    Mr. Poe. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Chairman, to submit a list of questions for each of the witnesses and their answers be given back to the Chair.    Mr. Poe. I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
