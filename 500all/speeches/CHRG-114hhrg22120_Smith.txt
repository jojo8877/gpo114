    Mr. Smith. Mr. Chairman, this Administration seems to have set a record for the number of agency heads who have wrongly deleted work-related emails, the number of Federal employees who have pled the Fifth Amendment to avoid incriminating themselves, and the number of officials who have failed to respond to lawfully served subpoenas.    Even in this deplorable company, one agency stands out. The Internal Revenue Service targeted organizations solely on the basis of their conservative views. We expect this kind of behavior from dictatorships and totalitarian governments, not from the United States of America's Government. It represents a direct attack on freedom of religion, it represents a direct attack on freedom of speech, and thus an attack on our Constitution and our democracy.    That this corruption of power continued unrestrained for several years can only lead to one conclusion: Such conduct is an abuse of office that was condoned by the Administration and warrants stiff penalties.    Mr. Chairman, I will yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Ohio, Jim Jordan.
