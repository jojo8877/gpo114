    Mr. Latta . Well, thank you very much. The gentleman yields back. And the Chair recognizes himself for 5 minutes. And I apologize, there is another subcommittee of the full committee running at the same time as this, but I tell you, this is a very, very important issue and I really appreciate the testimony that you all submitted today, and also being here today.    And, Mr. Siebel, if I could start with you, how do the kinds of energy analytics you have described help us with energy security and reliability?    Mr. Latta. Well, thank you very much.    Mr. Atkinson, and how do advanced grid technologies help prevent the outages and enable the grid to better withstand outages when they do occur, and how can the technologies facilitate faster outage restorations and provide utility crews with greater situational awareness?    Mr. Latta. Well, thank you very much.    My time has expired, and the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Johnson, for 5 minutes.
