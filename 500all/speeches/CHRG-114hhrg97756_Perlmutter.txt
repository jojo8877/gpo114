    Mr. Perlmutter. Thanks, Mr. Chair. You know, the purpose of this is we're a very connected society obviously, and that connectedness is great for comfort, for convenience, for efficiency, but it has an obvious downside, which is a potential domino effect of it all failing at once, whether it's a nuclear device, it's cybersecurity, it's space weather, it's just some huge planetary Earth kind of weather thing.    So, Dr. Baker, I want to start with you real quick and then to you, Ms. Bartol, and then I'm going to yield the balance of my time to Mr. Takano.    Given where we are, if you had your wish list, what would be the things we could do to predict better and more quickly the space weather events you talked about to minimize the damage that might come from a big event?    Mr. Perlmutter. And you would suggest that we invest some more to avoid what could be----    Mr. Perlmutter. --potentially unbelievable costs    Mr. Perlmutter. Okay.    Mr. Perlmutter. Okay. Ms. Bartol, what would you suggest that we do today to minimize the potential for cyber attacks that bring down the system?    Mr. Perlmutter. I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Perlmutter. Mr. Chair, just a second. Did you recognize that Dr. Baker was from Colorado?    Mr. Perlmutter. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I meant to mention that. I'm sorry.    Mr. Perlmutter. I'll stick to beer.
