    Mr. Peters. Director Comey--I want to, first of all, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for being here. I wanted to just conclude by saying that I did hear very--did listen carefully to your opening statement. I thought it was very constructive. I think you appreciate the two objectives we have here, which is to both preserve privacy and to deal with San Bernardino. You've heard the comment: hard cases make bad law. They're still hard cases, and the problem we see in terrorism now is the onesies and the twosies. And the notion that we would have invulnerable communications, I think, is something that we should all be concerned about.    I hope that you and the panel to follow you will all be part of a constructive discussion to figure out a way to serve both objectives and that the lines won't be too hard drawn on either side so we can do that.    And I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, the chance to thank Director Comey for being here, and look forward to the next panel.    Mr. Peters. Yield back.
