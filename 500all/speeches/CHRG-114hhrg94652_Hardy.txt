    Mr. HARDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Most of you already spoke on currency manipulation and that you really do not have much familiarity, but Mr. Brightbill, the question I have for you is would currency manipulation be better off under the Treasury, handled under the Treasury rather than under the TPA? Just a question.    Mr. HARDY. Thank you.    This is kind of across the panel here. You have all had success in what you are doing trading overseas. What advice would you give small business to get them to maybe get more involved? What advice would you give them to help them have a little courage to step out there and start using the foreign markets? Does anybody care to start with that one?    Mr. HARDY. Thank you. You just led into my next question, because I think some of those discussions--do you feel like you being involved in this trade TPA as businesses in the discussion of fair trade, balanced trade, do you feel like your voice is being heard? Because sometimes I feel like being new here, that we do not utilize the real experts, the real people who get harmed or benefit enough. Does everybody--go ahead.    Mr. HARDY. That is good to hear.    Mr. HARDY. Thank you.    Mr. HARDY. Thank you.    Can I ask one more question, Mr. Chairman?    Are there any ideas of how we can do a better job of bringing small business into that discussion better?    Mr. Brightbill?
