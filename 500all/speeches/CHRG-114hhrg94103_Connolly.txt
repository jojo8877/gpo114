    Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome back, Mr. Moure-Eraso.    Mr. Engler, you have called for the rescission of the Board decision of January 28. Is that correct?    Mr. Connolly. And why do you think it should be rescinded?    Mr. Connolly. Would you----    Mr. Connolly. Thank you. Would you say that the decision to rescind made on January 28 was a pretty profound decision?    Mr. Connolly. Because?    Mr. Connolly. OK. Thank you so much.    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman of the CSB, you voted to rescind, on that date, 18 Board orders. Is that correct?    Mr. Connolly. And one of those Board orders was Board Order 23, which established policies and procedures for hiring and selecting career appointments to the SES, the Senior Executive Service. Is that correct?    Mr. Connolly. And also, that order also established the Executive Resources Board within your agency that--and that board conducts the hiring process and makes recommendations of best qualified candidates to the Board. Is that correct?    Mr. Connolly. Uh-huh. Why did you decide to vote to essentially eliminate the Executive Resources Board?    Mr. Connolly. Well, what----    Mr. Connolly. Mr. Sullivan----    Mr. Connolly. OK. Hold that thought.    Mr. Sullivan, I was under the impression OPM regulations actually require having an Executive Resources Board. Is that not correct?    Mr. Connolly. I've got the regulation right here: 3393, career appointments, subsection B, each agency shall establish one or more Executive Resources Boards, et cetera, et cetera.    So that seems to contradict exactly what you just said, Dr. Moure-Eraso.    Mr. Connolly. But you just said in answer to my question that in rescinding Board Order 23, the Executive Resources Board went away. Would that----    Mr. Connolly. An additional board.    Mr. Connolly. Is it also not true that the CSB recently entered into a contract with a private company to handle the agency's recruiting and hiring of senior executives?    Mr. Connolly. Was that contract awarded to a long-time friend and associate of your general counsel, Mr. Loeb?    Mr. Connolly. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, my time is up, but I do want the say I think there are so many issues here, One does not know where to begin. I am deeply troubled at what is--looks like the politicization of the hiring process and cronyism and, frankly, a very cloudy, if not illegal, meeting that took place on January 28 with, as Mr. Engler said, profound implications in the management of this agency. And it ought to concern all of us.    With that, I yield back.
