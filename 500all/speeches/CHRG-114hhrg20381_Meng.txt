    Ms. Meng. Thank you, Chairman Salmon and Ranking Member Sherman, as well as all of our distinguished guests for coming to testify here today.    I especially love to see a professor from City University of New York on our panel. We continue to express our condolences to so many people and their families who have been affected by the landslides and our thoughts and prayers continued to be with them.    The election of President Sirisena in January 2015 brought the promise of a wide variety of reforms and a more inclusive government that would protect the interests of all Sri Lankans regardless of ethnic and religious affiliations.    The United States has a strong interest in ensuring that Sri Lanka remains committed to these reforms and we have certainly deepened our engagement with Sri Lanka in anticipation that a Sirisena government will follow through with these promises.    Sri Lanka has certainly taken some steps to implement a few reforms. But many people, particularly in the minority populations, experience ongoing violence and have been frustrated with the slow reform process that remains extremely vulnerable to political divisions.    I look forward to hearing your assessment on the current reform process and challenges. Thank you, and I yield back.
