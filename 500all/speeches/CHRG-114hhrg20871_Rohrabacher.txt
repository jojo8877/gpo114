    Mr. Rohrabacher. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    I'd just like to get some numbers straight here. So over the last ten years we have spent $900 million on this project, is that right?    Mr. Rohrabacher. No, 700--how much has the United States spent on it?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Well, how much money--we have spent how much money over the last ten years, the United States?    Mr. Rohrabacher. So about----    Mr. Rohrabacher. Okay.    Mr. Rohrabacher. So----    Mr. Rohrabacher. So around about $900 million is----    Mr. Rohrabacher. Okay. And how much have our partners spent on this project?    Mr. Rohrabacher. No, no, how much have they already spent is the question.    Mr. Rohrabacher. They have already spent seven billion?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Okay. So we've spent $900 million, and they've spent seven billion on the project already, is that correct?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Nine hundred million.    Mr. Rohrabacher. All right. So we've spent a grand total of perhaps--six billion on this project already has been spent, is that correct?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Six, seven billion dollars. All right. And we've spent nine billion. And we would expect to spend four-six billion more of our money in the next ten years, is that correct?    Mr. Rohrabacher. We would be spending four billion?    Mr. Rohrabacher. And how much----    Mr. Rohrabacher. And how much would our--how much are our allies in this project expected to spend----    Mr. Rohrabacher. --more?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Right.    Mr. Rohrabacher. Okay. The----    Mr. Rohrabacher. How much--so of the 18 billion, we will be spending four to six billion, and they will be spending the rest, is that right?    Mr. Rohrabacher. All right. That's what I'm looking for there. And this--we would--it's going to be ten years before we actually will be determining whether or not the project has been successful?    Mr. Rohrabacher. All right. And so the total price of what we're ending up talking about is what? I'm trying to add up the figures here. What, twenty billion?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Twenty billion dollars. And let me just note that--and what would you--you'd say the chances--after $20 billion, the chances of success and of reaching what theoretically is possible, what would you say the chances are of actual success in achieving that?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Well----    Mr. Rohrabacher. The engineering--so it's possible, however, the engineering couldn't--I mean, for example, I understand that already there's been great progress made in the producing the advanced materials that--the actual material science has grown a long way, and you've achieved the goals--a lot--many of the goals that are necessary in the materials area. But that was possible that that may not have happened. I mean, we actually achieved a goal we didn't know we could achieve----    Mr. Rohrabacher. --and we achieved it. So you're going to have to lay odds on----    Mr. Rohrabacher. --all the engineering and all these things coming together. What are your odds?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Okay. Let me----    Mr. Rohrabacher. Let me mention this. There are a lot of wonderful things that we can do in this world.    Mr. Rohrabacher. Wonderful things, and----    Mr. Rohrabacher. Okay. And ITER maybe one of them, but what we do is we judge each one based on the cost and the chances of success. And I'm sorry, I've been through a lot of these hearings, and I still think that the money that we put into trying to develop fusion--had we put $20 billion in this same effort into perfecting fission, we'd be a lot--it's a lot greater chance for improving mankind.    But as we move forward, I wish you success because we want those dollars not to be wasted.    Mr. Rohrabacher. Thank you.
