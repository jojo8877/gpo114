    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Mr. Dodaro, one issue identified in today's GAO report as an area of potential cost savings is the management of information technology investments. This is particularly--particularly an important area to invest in, giving our committee's growing focus on cybersecurity and, to me, as the ranking member on the IT subcommittee. Today's GAO report estimates that, at least, $79 billion will be spent on information technology by the Federal Government in fiscal year 2015. Is that accurate?    Ms. Kelly. And in your opinion, what opportunities exist for reducing duplication and improving efficiency in this area?    Ms. Kelly. Data center consolidation?    Ms. Kelly. And how many employees does that effect in a negative way, like losing their job?    Ms. Kelly. Okay.    Ms. Kelly. Okay. Thank you.    Also, OMB in 2012 launched the PortfolioStat initiative. Under this program, agencies are required to review their IT investments in order to make more efficient decisions. How does the PortfolioStat help reduce wasteful spending by Federal agencies and has it?    Ms. Kelly. This year's GAO report states, ``While the 26 Federal agencies required to participate in PortfolioStat have made progress implementing OMB's initiatives, weaknesses existed in agency's implementation of the initiative.'' Do you feel like that's correct?    Ms. Kelly. Well, I want to thank you so much and I sincerely hope that we can work together to achieve the nearly $6 billion in savings with the proper implementation of the program. So thank you so much.     Ms. Kelly. Yes. Your friend----
