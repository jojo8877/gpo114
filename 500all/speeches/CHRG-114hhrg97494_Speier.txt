    Ms. Speier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our experts who are here today. You know it has been said that we have the best weapons in the world, but our acquisition pipeline often gets us those weapons late and over budget.    Mr. Francis, you have said that to describe our acquisition process as broken is an oversimplification because it implies that it can merely be fixed. Time and time again we have tried to overhaul this process. We come up with the same challenges, an ingrained culture, an inadequately trained workforce, an inexperienced set of program managers, and a dangerous revolving door to industry.    In March of 2015, the GAO issued a report that 19 of the 38 assessed programs reported they planned to begin production prior to completing software development needed for baseline capabilities. A perfect example is the F-35, where software for even basic capabilities necessary for testing and evaluation are running months behind. As weapons systems grow in complexity, this is a problem that will come up more often than before.    How can we adjust our acquisitions process to better develop and test the software components of the hardware? And that question is open to any of you.    Ms. Speier. Mr. Francis, you were here almost exactly 2 years ago on October 29, and I am sure you feel like a broken record, but on the theme of repeating yourself today, you mentioned the Ford-class aircraft carrier in your testimony. Saying that the GAO identified this program as lacking a good business case back in 2007. That makes the program's current struggles unfortunate but not at all unsurprising.    What programs are currently in the pipeline that we should be looking at with greater scrutiny? What aren't we looking at today that you will be talking about in 2 years?    Ms. Speier. Thank you. I yield back.    The Chairman. Ranking member.
