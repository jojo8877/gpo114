    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Welcome, Mr. Secretary. It is good to have you here.    Could you please provide the committee with an overview and your outlook on how we are doing on reducing carbon pollution? How are we doing here in the United States? What are our challenges and opportunities? And after the Paris agreement, give us a short sketch of the world community and whether or not you have seen countries begin to implement their commitments.    Ms. Castor. And I understand here in the U.S. that, even with the hiccup on the Clean Power Plan at the Supreme Court, still, utilities overall and States and communities are moving toward the carbon reduction goals in any event because they know it is critical to the future of our country. Is that your understanding, too, that the markets are changing; the market for clean energy innovative solutions is growing at this time?    Ms. Castor. Right. Sometimes there is a disconnect between what happens here on Capitol Hill and what is really happening out in the business world and locally, too. But I want to compliment you for what you have proposed to do in the upcoming budget. On Mission Innovation, you have launched this--after the landmark global agreement in Paris, you proposed double funding for Government-wide clean energy R&D over the next 5 years. Your agency is set to be the leader in this effort. And I look forward to working with you to make this a reality. I was pleased to see robust funding for this initiative in the budget request.    Talk to us a little bit more about what you envision for Mission Innovation and how this is going to benefit all facets of our energy economy.    Ms. Castor. I agree. Thank you.
