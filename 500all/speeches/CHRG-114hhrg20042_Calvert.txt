    Mr. Calvert. Good morning. The subcommittee will come to order. I would like to extend a warm welcome to my colleagues, our witness, and the audience as we begin the Fiscal Year 2017 appropriations process. Today is the Interior and Environment Subcommittee's first oversight hearing of the year.    Chief Tidwell and Mr. Dixon, I would like to welcome you back to the subcommittee. We are pleased to be able to hear from you regarding the Fiscal Year 2017 budget request for the United States Forest Service.    Similar to last year, the President requests a total of $4.9 billion in discretionary funding for the Forest Service for Fiscal Year 2017. This is $150 million less than Fiscal Year 2016 enacted. A total of $2.5 billion was requested for wildland fire management. This represents nearly 50 percent of the entire Forest Service budget. In addition, a budget cap adjustment of $864 million is requested.    This subcommittee continues to be concerned about the cost of fighting wildfires and the effects it has on the Forest Service's budgets, programs, and management. Technically, the 2015 fire season is considered below normal at 93 percent of the 10-year average for the number of wildfires reported. However, the statistic belies a devastating reality. In 2015, more than 68,000 fires burned more than 10 million acres, causing an agonizing loss of life, destroying more than 4,600 homes and other properties, and devastating local and regional landscapes and communities.    The toll on our firefighters and supporting staff was also severe. According to the National Interagency Coordination Center, the request for firefighting resources were right at or exceeded the 10-year average, and the requests for air support were fulfilled or exceeded their averages.    So I would like to thank you, Chief Tidwell, for the Administration's efforts to change the way we budget for wildfires. I would also like to thank Congressman Simpson with his dramatic entrance----    Mr. Calvert . For keeping the pressure on Congress to address the issue. As of yesterday, I understand Mr. Simpson has convinced 145 of our colleagues to co-sponsor his bill, including every member of this subcommittee.    While the issue of how to fund firefighting costs seems to dominate most discussions about the Forest Service, there are numerous other issues, including air asset management, law enforcement, land acquisition, and basic budgeting and program management, among others, that need to be attended to. The Forest Service must demonstrate that it is accountable, transparent, and able to improve the condition of its forests while managing unpredictable fire seasons.    This is a difficult challenge. I realize it is not entirely in your hands. Congress must provide the financial resources and address policy matters that limit the Agency's ability to manage the Nation's forests. But some parts are in your hands, especially accounting, budgeting, and program management. I look forward to talking to you more about them today as we prepare the House bill for Fiscal Year 2017.    Chief, you and the entire Forest Service staff deserve our appreciation for your work on behalf of the American people and our Nation's forests. We know you all care deeply for our forests and the communities that depend on them. So I thank you.    And now, I am happy to yield to the gentlelady from Minnesota, Ms. McCollum, for any opening remarks she might make.                    Opening Remarks of Ms. McCollum    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. And, Chief, you are recognized for your statement.                    Opening Remarks of Chief Tidwell    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, we are going to start with Mr. Stewart out of courtesy. He has a hearing he needs to attend, so I am going to recognize him first. Thank you.    Mr. Calvert. I am the clock. Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Thank you. Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Chief, I have a couple of questions on the wildland first and the budget cap adjustment. Your Fiscal Year 2017 budget again proposes to establish a new budget framework for the Wildland Fire Management Program. A total of $874 million in discretionary fund is the request for fire suppression, and an additional $864 million is requested through a budget cap adjustment. On that, can you share for us any lessons you learned from this last fire season in 2015?    Mr. Calvert. Okay. Do you believe that a budget cap adjustment will help improve the Nation's forests, and have you laid that out in your budget request?    Mr. Calvert. All right, thank you. Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Cole.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Jenkins.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Amodei.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Joyce.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Ms. McCollum, any further questions?    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. One quick thing. You mentioned technology, and our staff was out in California, and they witnessed that your employees are kind of jerry rigging their own technologies at some point. They are using their iPads, their iPhones. There is no real policy or guidelines that are set to utilize new technology more effectively.    We did use Predator for the Rim Fire. If you remember, we had a hell of a time getting permission to unleash that technology. I had to call the Secretary of Defense----    Mr. Calvert . At that time was Chuck Hagel, and he was on the airplane, and tell him to please sign a memo that is floating around that airplane someplace to allow us to use the Predator on site.    Since then, have there been any conversations with the Department of Defense to have more efficient, effective coordination when the fire first starts. I have been told if you can get that resource above the fire immediately, it helps direct the other aircraft, find the hot spots, and maybe put out the fire faster. The other aircraft cannot see that through the smoke, and using advanced technology to interface with firefighters that are on the ground with their iPads and iPhones where they can immediately know where they need to be, and where to go.    Mr. Calvert. In San Diego when we had fires, we could not get the Marine Corps to use their helicopters and do spotting. I remember it took us 2 days to get permission to use the Marine Corps helicopters. And the Marines wanted to help, but they had to get a sign-off from here in Washington. Sometimes 2 days is a critical period of time where we could not use those spotters to bring in the air resources to put that fire out.    Mr. Calvert. Good. Okay. Are there any other questions?    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. I know there are a number of other questions. We will submit them for the record. And I discussed before some groundwater issues that I would like to get on the record also. So any questions, please submit them and we will get them answered in a timely fashion by the chief.    Mr. Calvert. I appreciate your being here today. Mr. Dixon, I appreciate your being here today. And we are adjourned.                                       Thursday, February 25, 2016.ROBERT McSWAIN, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY DIRECTOR, INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Mr. Calvert. Good morning, and welcome to this oversight hearing for the Fiscal Year 2017 budget for the Indian Health Service.    Funding for Indian Country has been a nonpartisan priority of the subcommittee for many years now. Working together, we have grown funding for American Indian and Alaska Native programs at a greater amount and at a faster rate than any other programs in the appropriations bill. As a result, contract support costs are now fully funded, freeing up operation funds, and affording tribes the capacity to run additional programs rather than relying on the Federal government to do it for them.    Funds to meet extraordinary medical costs to victims of disasters or catastrophic illness which used to run out in the middle of the year, and, thus, spawn the common refrain in Indian Country, ``Do not get sick after June,'' are now finally in Fiscal Year 2017 estimated to last the entire year.    More children are receiving proper dental care. More teens are receiving the help and support they need to battle substance abuse and suicide. More providers are being recruited because we have been helping to pay their student loans. More new care facilities are opening their doors each year.    The list of accomplishments go on and on, and we are deeply proud of our work. But we also recognize that we still have a long way to go before health disparities in the American Indian and Alaska Native population compared to the Nation as a whole become a thing of the past.    I hope that today's hearing will help highlight the measurable differences that reflect funding increases that have been made. As a subcommittee we need to be able to communicate to our colleagues in Congress that the sacrifice we make elsewhere in this appropriations bill in order to increase funding for Indian Country is actually saving lives.    Saving more lives, however, is not simply a function of more money. The Indian Health Service is battling a management crisis in the Great Plains area, for example. The crisis reached a new low point recently when the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, terminated its agreement with Obama-Winnebago Indian----    Mr. Calvert. Omaha, excuse me. Omaha. After Denver's win, I should know that. Omaha. Omaha-Winnebago Indian Hospital because the conditions at the hospital posed an immediate jeopardy to the health and safety of patients. Just a few months later, CMS threatened to do the same at two additional Indian Health Service hospitals in the Great Plains area. All three hospitals are directly run by the Indian Health Service rather than by the tribes, and all three remain open for business under intense management scrutiny.    That said, it is not my wish to focus today on a hearing on the crisis in the Great Plains. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs has already held a hearing on the matter, and I doubt it will be the last. Also I do not wish to imply that funding and management are unrelated. We all know that it takes money to hire and retain good people.    My point is this. When the Indian Health Service struggles with management and accountability, the subcommittee struggles even more to find the money, the offsets, and the votes to fund increases for the Indian Health Service.    The President's Fiscal Year 2017 budget is particularly challenging. The bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increases Fiscal Year 2017 discretionary budget authority by less than one-tenth of 1 percent. And yet the President is proposing an 8 percent, $377 million increase for IHS without any realistic offsets elsewhere in the budget. Of the proposed increase, $241 million is just to keep pace with tribal and Federal pay costs, contract support cost, medical inflation, and population growth in order just to maintain current levels of service.    Program increases developed in close consultation with tribal leaders, which are necessary to staff newly constructed facilities, and to make any real progress to decrease the health disparities of American Indians and Alaska Natives compared to the Nation as a whole, are an additional $136 million.    With us today from the Indian Health Service to get into the details and answer questions are principal director and current acting director, Mr. Robert McSwain--it is good timing--and his second in command, Deputy Director Mary Smith. Welcome, Mr. McSwain, and welcome aboard, Ms. Smith, I look forward to your testimony today.    But before opening statement, I would like to ask our distinguished ranking member, Ms. McCollum, for any opening remarks.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. McSwain, you are recognized for your opening statement.                     Opening Remarks of Mr. McSwain    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Mr. McSwain. Mr. Cole will start off the questioning.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Let me ask a question regarding your testimony. As you mentioned, our appropriations have increased approximately 43 percent since 2008, and substantial investments to impact the quantity, of course, but also the quality of healthcare provided to American Indians and Alaskans. What do you consider to be some of the most significant improvements? You mentioned measuring. How do you measure that progress?    Mr. Calvert. On the behavioral health issue, we have some of these Native institutions. For instance, I have one near my district in California, the old Sherman Indian Institute. And it seems in the past, many folks sent their children out to these schools for education.    But it seems lately, that they are sending young people to these outer areas to get away from their homes primarily to fix a behavioral issue or some family issue that they cannot deal with on their own reservation. Are these facilities, or is it better to have, as you say, these centers closer to home, closer to their families? How do you look at that?    Mr. Calvert. Right.    Mr. Calvert. Sure.    Mr. Calvert. I look forward to attending the ribbon cutting.    Mr. Calvert. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. I will just ask another question here. The Federal government funds many of the healthcare programs for which American Indians and Alaska Natives are eligible to receive services free of charge. Full enrollment in these programs can stretch limited appropriations to the Indian Health Service much further. Could you update the committee on Indian Health Service's efforts to achieve full enrollment for the eligible service population?    Mr. Calvert. What are you doing to encourage people to enroll in Medicare and Medicaid programs.    Mr. Calvert. Well, it certainly helps us on our appropriations process if we are able to move that across. I certainly would encourage you to do that because we have challenges just to increase the appropriations this year, just to stay even with the increased cost in healthcare in Indian country.    So anything that we can do to offset some of this is certainly important. Do you have a thought?    Mr. Calvert. Okay, good.    Mr. Calvert. Right. Thank you. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. Just to clarify on Mr. Simpson's question, when we are talking about moving funds, we are not just talking about moving funds within the Health Service. Can you move funds from outside of the Health Service within the Bureau's accounts? I think maybe that is what he is also asking. Have you ever moved money outside of your particular line, out of the Indian Health Service account?    Mr. Calvert. Okay. I just wanted to clarify that.    Mr. Calvert. Well, I certainly want to thank you for your attendance today. We appreciate your coming to our hearing. We wish you well. You have a big challenge ahead of you. We will try to work with you the best we can to help you meet those challenges.    With that, if there are no further questions, we are adjourned.                                       Thursday, February 25, 2016.                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Mr. Calvert. Good afternoon, and welcome to this oversight hearing on the Fiscal Year 2017 budget of the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation.    The Relocation Program in Arizona impacts relatively few Americans, but to those it does impact, it does so deeply and in personal ways. Being told to relocate from one's home and pull up one's own roots can be devastating to a family and to any community no matter what incentives are offered to try and make the process easier.    Perhaps that is why the Navajo and Hopi land dispute has been called the greatest land title problem in the West, and perhaps that is why the Relocation Program, which was created to solve the problem, was expected to take 5 years and cost $41 million. Well, it continues today 40 years later and $568 million after its inception.    We are here today because this subcommittee has redoubled its efforts to succeed where so many good people before us have fallen short. In December of 2014 at the subcommittee's request, the inspector general of the Department of the Interior published a report concluding that the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation cannot complete its work and cease operations in the near future without legislative changes and/or an increase in annual appropriations. The inspector general further pointed out that the increasing appropriations in the short term is a more cost effective strategy than continuing with the status quo. The report recommended that this subcommittee consider alternatives and determine an approach that will best control costs and complete the relocation mission in an acceptable, judicious, and timely manner.    In January 2015, members of this subcommittee visited the Hopi Tribe and the Navajo Nation to see the challenge firsthand and to hear from those most directly affected about what has gone right, and what has gone wrong, and where we should go from here. The message we heard was clear: do not leave until you finish the job.    In December 2015, the subcommittee more than doubled the Relocation Program's budget to $15 million in Fiscal Year 2016 in order to reduce the backlog of 96 certified applicants awaiting relocation and to work through 200 additional known appeals. Just this week, the Office of Inspector General released its second subcommittee commissioned report which looked into the allegations made by relocated families that homes and infrastructure are incomplete or in need of repair.    The law says that the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation shall cease to exist when the President determines that its functions have been fully discharged. In consultation with this subcommittee, the Agency has set a goal to complete its work so that the next President can be in a position to make such a determination by September 30th, 2018, about 2 and half years from now.    The Fiscal Year 2017 budget proposes a modest 3 percent increase to work with the Navajo Nation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the other Federal departments and agencies to ensure that this program can be brought to a fair end, and to ensure that any responsibilities remaining after the closure will be transferred to the appropriate Federal or Navajo entities.    Cleary there is much to be done, and the devil is always in the details. Hopefully today's hearing will flush out some of those details and begin to put us on a path to completion as quickly as possible, but not a day faster than is needed to ensure that those affected by the program have been treated fairly, honorably, and with dignity.    This is not a partisan issue. It is a human issue. It is a nation-to-nation issue. It is an opportunity to make good on a commitment to shake hands and let deep wounds begin to heal.    My former boss, the late President Ronald Reagan, once said, ``No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size, so government programs once launched never disappear.'' Actually a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we will ever see on this earth. If he were alive today, he may have to make at least one exception.    I am pleased to be joined today by my subcommittee colleagues as well as the senior leadership team of the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation, executive director, Chris Bavasi, chief financial officer, Nancy Thomas, chief counsel, Larry Ruzow. Welcome. It is nice to see you all again. Thank you once again for your hospitality last year during the subcommittee's visit.    Before turning to you for your opening statement, allow me to ask my friend and colleague, the subcommittee's ranking member, Betty McCollum, for her opening remarks that she might wish to make. Ms. McCollum.                    Opening Remarks of Ms. McCollum    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. And, Mr. Bavasi, you are recognized.                     Opening Remarks of Mr. Bavasi    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. We will get right into it. The Department of the Interior's inspector general recommends that Congress legislate a sunset date for the Relocation Program, and provide the requisite level of appropriations to meet the Agency's statutory obligations by that date. You testified that the Agency is focused on completing its work so that the next President can make a determination on whether to close at the end of Fiscal Year 2018.    The question is, since current law puts the decision in the President's hands, is there a reason why it still may be necessary for Congress to legislate a sunset date?    Mr. Calvert. Does a determination that the Agency's functions have been fully discharged mean that the Federal government's work is done?    Mr. Calvert. Much of the appeal and relocation process is out of the Agency's hands. Can a determination be made that the Agency's functions have been fully discharged if a case is pending before the court or not everyone has been relocated?    Mr. Calvert. Okay. We all know that failing to plan is the same as planning to fail. My sense is that you are still very early in the closeout and transition planning process, and that in order to meet your target date you will have to pick up that pace considerably and immediately. Is that a fair assessment?    Mr. Calvert. Yeah. Will you commit to providing the committee with a quarterly status report from this point forward to see where we are at and where we are going?    Mr. Calvert. The law says that your Agency may call upon any other Federal agency for assistance, and that any failure to provide reasonable assistance must be reported to Congress. So that would be helpful if going forward we continue to communicate and find out how we are doing. Our intent is to close this out in Fiscal Year 2018, so we want to make sure that there is no reason for that not to happen.    Mr. Calvert. Okay. Ms. McCollum, you are recognized.    Mr. Calvert. That would be helpful if you could submit that for the record.    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentlelady. Mr. Cole.    Mr. Calvert. If the gentleman would yield, I am hopeful that as we go through this process over the next 2\1/2\ years, and the questions are legitimate questions that are being asked, are addressed early, one, get that out there. And I am sure even after this offices closes that we probably will have to move some money over to the BIA to carry on some of these legacy responsibilities.    You know, we were out there at Spider Mill, and it seemed to me just looking at it from my old job as a builder that there were some subsidence issues around there, and there may be some legitimate concern over and above, you know, immediate construction remedies that you do as a normal course of business. But that may or may not be the case, I am not sure. We will leave that to the experts to decide.    Voice. East Mill, sir.    Mr. Calvert. What is that?    Voice. East Mill, not Spider Mill.    Mr. Calvert. Excuse me, East Mill. I think we need to make sure we have a budget when we conclude this where we do not delay concluding your job, but move that responsibility to someone else where we can make sure that happens. We need to work with you to make sure we have sufficient funds to move over to the BIA, to make sure whether the judgment fund is involved, and all the rest of it so we can answer those questions when we move along.    Mr. Calvert. If the gentlelady would yield, are you still building homes in that area?    Mr. Calvert. Okay.    Mr. Calvert. Just a couple of other questions on this relocation process. Does your Agency have the legal authority to choose an eligible recipient home site for them?    Mr. Calvert. How many times has your Agency exercised that authority?    Mr. Calvert. With your increased workload and target closeout date, does your Agency intend to exercise that authority, if necessary, to meet your deadlines? If not, what are your alternatives?    Mr. Calvert. This is important because we do want to come back here in a year or 2 years and find out that there is a person that stops this whole process. That is what happened before. So that is something that is important because, again, I want to see this close out at the end of 2018.    Any other questions?    Voice. Mr. Joyce.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Joyce.    Mr. Calvert. Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Okay, fine. I appreciate your coming out from Arizona. We appreciate your being here. Thank you so much. And this hearing is adjourned.                                          Wednesday, March 2, 2016.                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Mr. Calvert. Okay. I think we will get started here. Some good news. There are not going to be any votes until 5:00, so we will have no interruptions during this hearing.    So the committee will come to order.    Secretary Jewell, I would like to welcome you to today's hearing along with Deputy Secretary Mike Connor, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget, Kris Sarri. Our hearing today will address the Fiscal Year 2017 budget priorities for the Department of Interior.    Madam Secretary, let me begin by wishing you a belated happy birthday.    Mr. Calvert. I heard you climbed a mountain on a wall, whatever that is.    Female Voice. Which mountain.    Mr. Calvert. Yeah, well, it is one of these mountains you put on----    Mr. Calvert. There you go. Mr. Calvert. Close enough. With the November elections just around the corner, this may be your last budget hearing before our subcommittee as Secretary. On behalf of the subcommittee, I want to thank you for your service and willingness to have frank discussions regarding the challenges we face.    In particular, I want to thank you for your tireless personal efforts to reform the Bureau of Indian Education. Working together, we have made real progress improving the quality of life and education throughout Indian Country. This is further evidence that we can work together to find common ground, even if we do not agree on every issue.    In that spirit, I would like to mention a few things before we receive your testimony. Overall the President's Fiscal Year 2017 budget request provides $11.9 billion in discretionary funding for Department of the Interior programs under the subcommittee's jurisdiction, 1 percent below the Fiscal Year 2016 level. The budget request assumes a reduction of $169 million in discretionary funding for wildfire programs while providing $290 million for fire programs through a budget cap adjustment.    The challenge of providing adequate wildfire funding remains one of the greatest challenges facing our subcommittee. I want to applaud my friend, former subcommittee chairman, Mike Simpson, for his continuing efforts to address this issue through his bipartisan legislation, which by the way has now 145 co-sponsors.    The budget request proposes funding PILT, which is very critical to our rural communities in the West, on the mandatory side of the ledger, but without providing an offset. This budget gimmick will only add to our challenge of addressing many legitimate needs in this bill.    The centennial of the National Park Service is one of the highlights of this year's budget request. Last year the subcommittee made a substantial investment in our national parks, providing additional funds for Park operations, addressing longstanding deferred maintenance issues. We will endeavor to make similar investments this year within the confines of our 302(b) allocation, which I am sure the chairman will let us know about pretty soon.    Like many from the West, I am concerned about the President using authority under the Antiquities Act for designating large national monuments. President Obama has used this authority 22 times since 2009 to designate nearly 4 million acres as new national monuments. This is more than every other President, except Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. These large designations often disregard the views and concerns of affected communities, local stakeholders, and their representatives in Congress.    Another challenge facing the Department and the subcommittee is the Endangered Species Act. ESA is a well-intentioned statute that has saved numerous species from extinction, but the authorization has long expired. We can and must have an open and realistic discussion in Congress about what is working and what is not.    It is increasingly clear that the Administration's priority goal is to make several forms of energy uneconomical, even obsolete. The latest example is the White House using the Department to double down on its anti-coal agenda by proposing a 3-year review of the Federal Coal Leasing Program and a moratorium on new coal leasing on public lands. Many perceive this as yet another attack on a key industry that supports energy production and energy jobs in the United States. I suspect the Department will face a number of lawsuits on the decision to halt coal leasing on Federal lands. I also expect you all to encounter significant challenges from the States should you attempt to increase the cost of coal via higher bonding requirements.    The committee fully expects the Department to follow the clear congressional direction from the Fiscal Year 2016 omnibus working with the States as partners on the stream buffer rule rather than ignoring States as has been the case since 2010. This is an issue of great interest and concern to members of this committee.    I am also concerned that the Administration is taking a page from the war on coal playbook and applying it to oil production. It appears that the Department is attempting to make it as costly as possible to operate offshore facilities so investors will simply walk away from prospective sites. Onerous requirements under the well control rule, for example, will likely lead job producers to opt not to drill in areas currently producing oil. The result is the Obama Administration de facto moratorium on oil production without engagement with Congress.    Lastly, even with the El Nino rains, my home State of California remains in the midst of a devastating drought affecting families, businesses, and landscapes across the West. While this subcommittee is limited in what we can do to address the drought itself, I implore you and the Department to apply common sense and take full advantage of opportunities under the law to store and pump these El Nino rains.    So far, even with the increased rainfall, we have not pumped as much water as we did last year in the midst of a drought. We have had 3 times as much as rain, and we have pumped less water. As of mid-February, more than 192,000-acre feet, enough water to serve over 2 million people for 1 year, has been lost because of lack of adequate pumping. That is pumping within the biological opinion. That is enough water to serve San Diego and San Francisco combined for a year. I ask you to use your remaining time as Secretary to provide some desperately needed relief to the people of my State.    In closing, I once again want to express my appreciation to the professional staff. Our subcommittee could not do its work without your budget shop, the various bureaus, and the folks sitting behind you. Thanks to each of you for everything you do.    And with that, I am happy to yield to the gentlelady from Minnesota, Ms. McCollum, for any opening remarks she would like to make.               Opening Remarks of Congresswoman McCollum    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentlelady, and we are joined today by our distinguished chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, Chairman Rogers, and I thank him for taking the time to contribute to this important conversation. Chairman Rogers, would you like to make any opening remarks?                   Opening Remarks of Chairman Rogers    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am also pleased to see our ranking member of the full committee, Ms. Lowey, is here today. I am happy to yield to the gentlelady for any opening remarks she would like to make.                 Opening Remarks of Congresswoman Lowey    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentlelady. And with that, Madam Secretary, I am happy to yield to you for your opening statement.                  Opening Remarks of Secretary Jewell    Mr. Calvert. And with that, we are going to start with our chairman, Mr. Rogers.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Ms. Lowey.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you for your questions. Well, Madam Secretary, I think you know what I am going to be talking about. We have a little drought in California. You may have heard about it. I have a chart up here behind Mr. Israel showing what is going on in the California Bay delta. Our reservoirs continue to be dangerously low. The winter's rain was a chance to fill these reservoirs. The first 2 months of this year produced double the amount of water that we received all of last year. All of last year. These rains should have provided needed relief to drought-stricken communities in California, yet you are pumping less water than you did last year in a historic drought, and this is significantly more rain and we are pumping less water than we did last year.    This just defies common sense. You know, the Endangered Species Act gives the Department some amount of flexibility. You know, we have gone through this very carefully. If you had simply chosen to pump as much water as is allowed under the biological opinion, you would have provided enough water for 2 million people for an entire year.    Instead, the Department sent the extra water out to sea, and that is not coming back. And it may be that we are not going to see significant rain for the balance of the year. But if we do, I would hope that you could help the people of the State of California. What do you say to the millions of people who could have been helped by these El Nino rains?    Mr. Calvert. There were some days where we were getting 50 to 60 thousand cubic feet per second moving through the delta.    Mr. Calvert. Well, as you know, over 95 percent of the water on some days was going through underneath the Golden Gate Bridge. How much water does it take to satisfy that environmental requirement? 100 percent? 99 percent?    Mr. Calvert. And that is a great point. When you have that much water moving, how can you reverse flow that? As you know, the pumps are capable of pumping up to 11,000 cubic feet per second. Most of those days that we are talking about in January, you were pumping less than 2,5000 cubic feet per second. Less than 2,500 cubic feet per second.    As I understand from the people that are up there, the old timers, the fish were not anywhere near the pumps. Matter of fact, there was just one day I think they took an incidental take of one fish. And they had to drop their pumping immediately. One fish.    Mr. Calvert. Are we ever going to pump? Are we ever going to see any water going to these reservoirs?    Mr. Calvert. Well, all we can do now is hope, hope that it rains because we cannot pump water that is already gone.    Mr. Calvert. Just a last comment. I know the Secretary mentioned stress. We have got farmers that are pretty stressed out in the Central Valley. Just last week it was announced that a major farmer is pulling out 10,000 acres of trees. 10,000 acres of trees. And the people that attend to those trees are out of work.    So just as much of a crisis what is going in coal country right now is happening in my State of California, and, by the way, people forget we are the largest farming State in the United States, but we have 1 million acres out of cultivation this year. 1 million acres.    I know we have a historic drought. I know the problems that you are operating under. But when you see more rain by multiples this year, and we are pumping less water than we did last year, most people look at that and say what the heck is going on. How do you explain that?    Mr. Calvert. Well, you know, I wrote the Bay Delta Agreement 15 years ago.    Mr. Calvert. And we have still not yet gone through the environmental procedures to get to construction on these projects. And we have gone through two additional biological opinions since that was done, and each biological opinion has become more and more restrictive. And the irony of this is the smelt population, for whatever reason, has continued to go south since 1992. Obviously there has been significant restrictions on how we operate the delta.    So I think anecdotally there is other information that we are not applying. I wish we should use good science to look at this problem and how we are operating up there because this clearly is not working.    Ms. McCollum, you are recognized.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. Yes, sir.    Mr. Calvert. No objection. Part of the record.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Next, Ms. Pingree, but before I turn to Ms. Pingree, on the wolf issue, as time keeps going on, you may want to take a look at Oregon and Washington also because it looks to me from reports I have been getting that the wolf population in Oregon and Washington is clearly beginning to recover quite handsomely based upon the number of dead sheep I have been hearing about.    So with that, Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Cole.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Mr. Cole. Next, Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Stewart.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Stewart is the most read author in Congress, we are very proud of him.    Mr. Calvert. I do not know either. Mr. Israel.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Amodei.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Jenkins.    Mr. Calvert. Let me ask this question for the gentleman. Your intent is to comply to the reporting language in the bill.    Mr. Calvert. And there is no reason not to be transparent and to provide the information to the States that have asked for this.    Mr. Calvert. And by the way, just to the point of Mr. Jenkins, these are governors both Democratic and Republican that have asked for this information. This is, as it was pointed out, not a partisan issue.    Mr. Calvert. We will be meeting with him tomorrow. Mr. Joyce.    Mr. Calvert. Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. A point to Ms. McCollum, we have this growth in marijuana groves, not just on the Forest Service property, but on BLM property, all kinds of property. I have been told by law enforcement it is primarily two major drug cartels coming out of Mexico. Every once in a while they shoot each other, and people get caught in the crossfire. So it is something we need to keep an eye on and to deal with.    Mr. Calvert. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the President has used authority under the Antiquities Act 22 times since 2009 to bypass Congress and designate 40 million acres as national monuments. So obviously this is going to have some fiscal impact, budget impact. How are we going to pay for all this?    Mr. Calvert. I am going to discuss now the Owyhee National Monument in Oregon. A number of groups have been urging the Administration to create this 2.5 million acre national monument in southeastern Oregon, an area that is larger than Rhode Island and Connecticut combined, and even Yellowstone National Park. These efforts included high-level meetings with the White House Council on Environmental Quality and other agencies.    The proposal and campaign has generated strong opposition from the area local residents, local governments, certainly the local congressman, and I have heard from him, with Malheur and other surrounding counties strongly opposed to this designation. Potential restrictions for access and grazing use on these lands is a strong concern that was mentioned earlier, where multigenerational family ranching make up the backbone of the local economy.    I understand that there are conversations taking place now between the BLM and some of the interested parties. There are also certainly requests for the Administration to make public its position and plans for the Owyhee Canyon lands. I guess nobody is hearing anything, you know, the biggest creator of fear is silence.    Are there any Department of Interior personnel assisting anyone in the White House, the Council on Environmental Quality, or elsewhere in the Administration with technical or other support related to the designation of a national monument around the Owyhee River in southeastern Oregon?    Mr. Calvert. Would you please confirm whether any such assistance is being given and provide a written response back to the committee based upon that conversation so we can have that and I can share that with Mr. Walden?    Mr. Calvert. Okay, great. Well, thank you. Any other questions? Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. I will just point out before I go onto Mr. Amodei better management would go farther to stop the pine beetle. We have tremendous overgrowth in some of the forests in the West, and there are just too many trees per acre. That is causing distress with the lack of water, which is helping increase the problems.    Mr. Amodei.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Just one quick little comment on this pumping issue, Mike, so you will know this issue. Thirty-four days out of 80 from December 1 when the season started, the flows through the delta ranged from 20,000 CFS to 50,000 CFS. You had days where literally 98 percent of the water was flowing underneath the Golden Gate Bridge. It begs the question, how much water is necessary for a smelt population. And, you know, how long is this season where we have not been able to pump water. I hope that is over by now. I hope that this season is over with the smelt so we can start pumping this water.    You do have the authority once you are convinced, that the smelt are no longer near the pumps, where you can pump in excess of 5,000 cubic feet per second. In case we do have significant storms, we have to take advantage of this. I am following this every single day.    Mr. Calvert. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. We appreciate your coming, Madam Secretary, and have a wonderful day.                                           Thursday, March 3, 2016.                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Mr. Calvert. The hearing will come to order. Good morning.    Director Pizarchik, at yesterday's hearing, the Secretary committed to everyone at this table--sorry. Hold on here. Excuse me.    All right. I have got to start off with my first opening statement. Yes. I haven't had my coffee yet.    The committee will come to order. Good morning, and welcome, Director. Thank you for joining us to discuss the 2017 budget request for the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. I believe fiscal year 2012 was the last time we had a budget hearing with you. So thank you for coming back.    We have seen many similar budget proposals from your office since then, and you have seen many similar responses from the committee in return. Last year, however, the budget proposed the POWER Plus initiative to accelerate Federal funding for the reclamation of abandoned mine land areas and to promote economic development in those local economies.    Chairman Rogers, Congressman Jenkins, and I took a look and supported the overall concept. Several administrative components generated concerns, which prompted a retooled, streamlined approach that we thought should be tested in a few States before making changes to the underlying law.    The Subcommittee has high expectations for the success of the pilot, including in the fiscal year 2016 Omnibus, and we will want to discuss our vision for successful implementation today.    I know that Chairman Rogers would like to be here today, but unfortunately, he has some other pressing commitments at this time. We ask that his testimony be entered into the record.    Mr. Calvert. As you know, his district in Kentucky is experiencing an unemployment crisis, and he asked me to convey his thanks for your partnership in implementing this AML pilot project.    Despite these good faith efforts and recognition by the administration of the dire straits in coal country, I share in the chairman's disappointment that the Administration continues to pursue a ``keep it in the ground'' policy when it comes to coal. While innovative economic development initiatives are part of the solution, the Chairman knows we will not be able to turn this situation around or provide meaningful support to the 10,000 coal miners in his district who are out of work without regulatory relief.    The Stream Protection Rule is a prime example of this overreach, and I trust you have seen the letter that Chairman Rogers and I sent to Secretary Jewell on February 4th, regarding the directives in the fiscal year 2016 Omnibus related to this rule. As we discussed with the Secretary yesterday, these directives reflect an agreement between Congress and the Administration that OSM has not been working with the States as partners. We would like to discuss how that will change this year.    It is also timely that we have this hearing today so as we may recognize the Budget Officer, Ruth Stokes. Today is her last day, and it is only fitting that we offer her our gratitude for her many years of service to our country.    I understand there is some room for interpretation regarding whether you are saying good-bye after 38 years versus 39 years. We will just round it up, just say 39 years, and I hope you have some good, independent trips outside of the budget cycle ahead of you, and we wish you the best in your retirement.    With that, I would like to yield now to our ranking member from Minnesota, Ms. McCollum, if you would like to offer any opening remarks?    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentlelady.    Director? Oh, excuse me, Director, you are recognized for your opening statement.                 Opening Remarks of Director Pizarchikproposed rule, and beginning on Monday, we started to upload those to regulations.gov to make them available to the States who have requested information and anybody else, for that matter.    Earlier this week, we sent a letter to 16 different States providing those details. We are not uploading the copyrighted material because, by law, if we were to make that available or copy it, we would be violating the copyright law. What we have provided are explanations and guidance to the States on how they can access those copyrighted materials, as well as working with them to provide those copyrighted materials in a way we can. We have offered the services of our librarian in that regard.    On the second question, it was ``What is the manner we plan to accommodate State requests for meeting?'' As I indicated, to date we have had, I think, 16 requests from the States to meet.    In my response to the States that went out earlier this week, we have proposed to schedule time at the upcoming Interstate Mining Compact Commission in mid April for the States and OSMRE to meet. We believe it is the most efficient way for everybody to get together. It will allow all the States who are planning on being there to have the benefit of having that meeting with us without any additional cost or expense.    And the third question was ``How will the results of the meeting be incorporated into the administrative record?'' Our plan is to prepare a summary or summaries of that and have it included in the administrative record that we are producing for that rule.    With that, Mr. Chairman, the last point is I thank you again for the opportunity to be here today. My full statement has been provided for the record, and at this point, I am available for questions.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you for your testimony.    Yesterday, we had the Secretary testify, as you know, and she committed at this table that the department would fully comply with the stream buffer directives in the fiscal year 2016 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. There were multiple opportunities for the Secretary to inform Chairman Rogers and this Committee that you sent letters to the States this week outlining what information is publicly available and where the States may find it if they look in the right places.    Unfortunately, we were not told until after the hearing, and it is not clear as to whether that decision was strategic or circumstantial. Regardless, it casts a cloud on what would have been a good faith effort to begin to repair a 5-year dysfunctional relationship with the States and finally work with them as partners. Instead, it appears to be business as usual for those who have been working on this issue day in and day out.    Further, as my good friend Ms. McCollum can attest, there are times when the laws enacted by Congress may require some clarification, especially when there is give and take on both sides to reach an agreement. That happens, and we are always happy to provide clarification of the offices under our jurisdiction so we are all on the same page.    To quickly review how fiscal year 2016 transpired, the Committee directive to OSM started as a directive to stand down on the Stream Buffer Rule because OSM failed to work with the States as cooperating agencies. For years, OSM has broken its word to the States.    Where Chairman Rogers and I come from, you are only as good as your word. And that means something. We are kind of old school in that regard. OSM had broken the trust of its State partners, and States with both Democratic and Republican leadership withdrew from the process as their voices were repeatedly ignored.    The common denominator was OSM. In order to put a final appropriations package together for fiscal year 2016, the Congress, the White House, the House, the Senate, and the Committee as a whole had to agree on how to resolve this issue. While there may have been some disagreement on the initial approach, the Committee as a whole agreed that OSM needed to reengage with the States as partners in this process.    So, Director, in order to avoid any confusion, any ambiguity, or any alternate interpretation of the Committee's direction or intent, Chairman Rogers and I and my fellow Committee members fully expect you to work with the States as cooperating agencies, as you have collectively agreed in 2010.    The source documents you have, they will now have, not Web links and not an address of a library where they may obtain the information. The analysis you have, they will have. The conclusions you reach, they need to agree with. Equally, the conclusions they reach, you need to agree with.    Otherwise, there isn't going to be a rule. For 5 years, OSM's work on this rulemaking has been proven to be a one-way street. That is over. The Congress and the Administration have agreed that you collectively need to work together.    I trust that your letters to the States this week serve as the first step in the process of information sharing, and April 18th will be the first of many meetings with the States in order to foster a substantial dialogue and exchange of ideas. But I need to verify that.    Can you please do so for the committee? Can you please verify for us that the letters this week are the first step to reengage in a meaningful partnership with the States, including the first exchange of data and the first of many meetings?    I don't want our first exchange at this table to be one where I find you in violation of a directive of this committee.    Mr. Calvert. And they want to work with you. They have made it very clear that they want a meaningful partnership, and so are you committing that you are going to work with the States and have a number of meetings and exchange information with them?    Mr. Calvert. Well, I am sure we will be hearing from the States to determine what they think.    Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Jenkins.    Mr. Calvert. If the gentleman would yield on that point? When you say something that is not subject to copyright, if the United States Government enters into an agreement with a contractor to provide a technical report, who is it owned by? The author of that report or by the United States, who paid for that report?    Mr. Calvert. I just want to clarify that. Then a report that is done on behalf of the United States Government is owned by the Government, and I don't believe that would be subject to any copyright rule.    Mr. Calvert. If those reports are being used to create a conclusion in order--which we are talking about, then those reports should be made public and made part of the information to provide it to the States.    Mr. Calvert. I find that----    Mr. Calvert. Yes. I would like to find that out specifically.    Mr. Calvert. If it is information that potentially is being withheld, we need to know that. Yes, thank you.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Joyce.    Mr. Calvert. Will the gentleman yield for a second? Are you saying that this regulation, as you interpret it, has no impact on employment in coal country?    Mr. Calvert. Just for the record, we would like to have that.    Mr. Calvert. And you agree with those assessments?    Mr. Calvert. But you agree with those assessments?    Mr. Calvert. I will take that you agree with those assessments, and obviously----    Mr. Calvert . The industry, when they anticipate a regulatory cost, they must be wrong about that because, based upon your assessment, there is no cost.    Mr. Joyce.    Mr. Calvert. Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Quick comment, and I am going to recognize Mr. Jenkins.    I used to chair the Environment Committee on Science, and one thing we need to make sure of, no matter what your position may be in some of the various issues that we have before us, that the science is untainted. Because I have seen a lot of science on both sides that have a political ramification to it.    So science is science. It should be unbiased and not for a particular purpose.    Mr. Jenkins.    Mr. Calvert. If the gentleman would yield for a moment?    Mr. Calvert. The pilot made no distinction on the pre-1977 sites or sites after 1977. So I want to make that clear. So I want to make sure that there is a difference between the pilot program that has passed in law versus the AML.    Mr. Calvert. Well, certainly if you want the intent of this Committee, the Committee's intent is that the pilot program language is what is in law.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Jenkins.    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentleman.    Any additional questions, Ms. McCollum?                                           Thursday, March 3, 2016.                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Mr. Calvert. The committee will come to order. We are going to have some votes here shortly, so what I want to attempt to do is to get through the opening statements, and then we will be able to come back for our Q&A after votes.    I want to say good morning to Director Neil Kornze, and I want to welcome him and his wife, Beckett, and their new 3-year, or 3-month-old baby, I should say. Okay, 3-month-old baby.    Mr. Calvert. And super cute, as amended.    Mr. Calvert. Okay. Well, again, good morning. Today we have our hearing on the President's budget request for the Bureau of Land Management for Fiscal Year 2017. I would like to welcome Neil Kornze, the director of Bureau of Land Management, to the subcommittee. Thank you for being here.    As the manager of more than 245 million acres of the Nation's land and 700 million acres of its subsurface mineral state, BLM is on the forefront of every land management issue facing the Nation today. BLMs programs, policies, and decisions, especially affect Americans in the West and certainly in my own home State of California.    The President's budget proposes $1.3 billion for BLM for Fiscal Year 2017. Overall this is a $7.1 million increase over Fiscal Year 2016. However, this seemingly moderate increase actually is much larger because of the fee proposals in the request.    We have many topics to discuss today regarding BLM's management of public lands and its funding request. I am certain we will cover the fee proposals, funding increases for hydraulic fracturing, and other oil and gas regulations, and the status of the Sage-grouse conservation effort. We will also cover the proposed improvement to the Wild Horse and Burro Program, and BLM's plans for newly designated national monuments in California.    Once again, I have to express my disappointment with the proposals to collect $16.5 million from a new fee for grazing permits and $48 million for a new fee for oil and gas inspection. We all know that Congress has rejected these proposals in the past. I expect that we will reject them in the Fiscal Year 2017 budget. The appropriations process is not the appropriate forum to debate these issues. They are best left to our colleagues in the authorizing committees.    BLM is proposing a $15.2 million increase to implement new rules and regulations for its onshore Oil and Gas Program. Well, not all of this is for the new rules. I do find it somewhat presumptuous to ask for an increase when the hydraulic fracturing rule is stayed and may be for some time, and the methane and waste reduction rule is in the early stages of its comment period.    When these two regulations are considered along with the proposed changes to the planning process, BLM sure seems to be focused on a lot of new regulations these days. Although we did not expect to be able to make significant investments in BLM's programs when we first started the Fiscal Year 2016 process, I am pleased that we were able to do so in a few places.    Most significant was the $45 million increase for Sage-grouse conservation. The budget requests an additional $19 million, including $5 million to implement the National Seed Strategy for Fiscal Year 2017. The funding provided last year was primarily intended to put into place on-the-ground conservation measures to help restore Sage-grouse habitat and the sagebrush ecosystem. We will need to know whether progress is being made with the existing funding as we wait for the request for additional funds.    Some States continue to have concerns with the resource management plans for Sage-grouse and proposed mineral withdrawal. Thank you for your letter responding to the subcommittee's report language and explaining how BLM worked with the States. I encourage you to continue these efforts and develop additional guidance, which would help clarify the implementation process and provide certainty to the States and other partners.    Before I close, I would like to mention the proposal to establish a BLM foundation. This subcommittee is interested in this concept. It has proven to be a successful model for the Department of Interior and Department of Agriculture agencies. It also has the potential to supplement and complement BLM's work. However, Congress needs a legislative proposal in order to move forward, and I hope that is coming soon.    Again, I want to thank you for being here today. I look forward to your testimony, and I yield to my good friend, Ms. McCollum, for her opening remarks.               Opening Remarks of Ranking Member McCollum    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Ms. McCollum, with your concurrence, I think we should just recess for a few minutes, go and vote, and we will come back for your opening statement. So we will be in recess.    Opening Remarks of Director Kornze    Mr. Calvert. Reconvene. Director, you may begin your opening statement.    Mr. Calvert. I thank you for coming out today, Mr. Kornze, and let us just start off, since you brought it up first, I will bring it up, too, Sage-grouse. In the omnibus, Congress directed BLM to issue guidance to its State offices on how it will update Sage-grouse habitat maps, adopt new scientific information, and engage partners. I believe guidance would allay much of the unnecessary or uncertainty regarding how BLM will implement their resource management plans.    So the first question is, how or has BLM issued any guidance.    Mr. Calvert. How about these maps, the Sage-grouse habitat maps? Have you updated those maps? Are you working with the States, too?    Mr. Calvert. Well, as you know, we put a significant increase in dollars in your budget because for the reason we do not want this species listed. We do not want to have you coming to us later on and say there is some reason we have to do this. We want to do everything we can to make sure that that does not happen.    With that, Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Israel.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Stewart.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Amodei.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. I would just like to get back to wild horses and burros real quick. We spent a lot of time on this issue. We spay and neuter cats and dogs, and we certainly should be doing that with the horses and burros. Where are you at on that? Tell us where you are at.    Mr. Calvert. Well, there are things that you can do that permanent. Mr. Calvert. Well, I think that we ought to, I mean, not just look at it. I mean, have a broad approach to apply it in the field. Do you intend to do that?    Mr. Calvert. Yeah. Well, obviously we have an over population on the range, and Mr. Stewart brought out that this is not good for the horses, and it is certainly not good for the ranchers, and it is certainly not good for the environment. So I would think that is more of a permanent solution. If we can start moving in that direction, I think that we should get support for that.    Mr. Calvert. I think that is part of the solution. I think that is certainly worth looking into. But right now we need to stop, you know, the number of horses that are being born out on the range.    Any other comments or any other questions? I know we have a series of votes. And so, we appreciate your being here, and I am sure you will be hearing more from members individually.    With that, we are adjourned.
