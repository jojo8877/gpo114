    Mr. Mix. They cannot. They cannot.    Chairman Kline.--has expired.    Mr. Jeffries.    Mr. Mix.--they can't.    Mr. Jeffries. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Let me start with Mr. Mix. To the extent that a union in a right-to-work state collectively bargains a higher wage, the nonunion employee benefits from that higher wage; correct?    Mr. Mix. That is correct. They are forced to accept that union as their bargaining agent. That is correct.    Mr. Jeffries. They are forced to accept a higher wage.    To the extent that a union in a right-to-work state collectively bargains a more robust health care plan, the nonunion employee benefits from that more robust health care plan; correct?    Mr. Mix. In your question, the answer is, yes. They are required to accept that, yes.    Mr. Jeffries. Okay. So and to the extent that a union in a right-to-work state collectively bargains a strong pension plan, for instance, the nonunion employee gets the benefit of that stronger pension plan; correct?    Mr. Mix. The answer to your question is correct because of the union's monopoly bargaining power that they asked for. They requested to be the exclusive bargaining agent. And, you know, they recognize that they can represent only their members.    Mr. Jeffries. Okay. So--    Mr. Mix. In fact, I hold a United Steelworkers brief to the NLRB in 2007 where they clearly recognize the ability under federal law to represent their members only. And if you were union, Congressman, if you could negotiate these benefits, don't you think workers would want to join you voluntarily? Absolutely yes.    Mr. Jeffries. Mr. Mix, I have got limited time. So it just seems to me to be fundamentally unfair if you are concerned about unfairness that you have a situation where you have workers make a voluntary decision not to participate in union membership, not to pay dues, but nonetheless get the benefit of that union membership. And in the grievance context, all that is being asked is that a reasonable fee be paid. But let me move on.    The productivity of the American worker has increased exponentially over the last 40-plus years; correct?    Mr. Mix. According to the EPI study, that is what I saw--    Mr. Jeffries. In fact, in studies that I have seen, it has increased since the early 1970s in excess of 275 percent. But at that same period of time, the wages of the American worker has largely remained stagnant; correct?    Mr. Mix. I can't really comment. I think that is the information that was--    Mr. Jeffries. Dr. Gould, is that correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Okay. So Americans are working more productively, but earning less, correct, Mr. Mix?    Ms. Mix. According to her statistics.    Mr. Jeffries. Okay. No one disagrees with those numbers, by the way, that I have seen in this institution during the two-plus years that I have been here.    Now, in America, do you think that there is a right-to-work for a fair wage and good benefits?    Mr. Mix. I think in a country that is founded on the basic principle of individual freedom, I think that workers have the right to negotiate a fair wage for a day's work, for sure. It is a fundamental piece--it is actually the fertilizer of who we are as a country; that somebody controls their ability to work.    Mr. Jeffries. And the better-paid workers are actually in fair share collective bargaining states; correct?    Mr. Mix. I would disagree with that vehemently.    Mr. Jeffries. Dr. Gould, is that correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Okay. Now, you made a statement, Mr. Mix, in my limited time, that is kind of extraordinary. So I think, let me just check that I got this correct; that workers in right-to-work states are better off. Is that your view?    Mr. Mix. That is my statement. Yes, sir.    Mr. Jeffries. Okay. Now, is Tennessee a right-to-work state?    Mr. Mix. Yes, sir.    Mr. Jeffries. And Tennessee is one of the poorest states in the union, true?    Mr. Mix. I don't know that to be fact. I can't testify to that fact.    Mr. Jeffries. Okay. Let me introduce into the record a table, Table 709, Individuals and Families Below Poverty Level Number and Rate by State. This is between 2000 and 2009. According to this document, Tennessee is the tenth-poorest state in the union.    Mr. Mix. It is not the poorest state.    Mr. Jeffries. We are gonna get to that.    Mr. Mix. Okay.    Mr. Jeffries. Louisiana is a right-to-work state; correct?    Mr. Mix. Yes, sir.    Mr. Jeffries. And is Louisiana one of the poorest states in the country?    Mr. Mix. I do not know that.    Mr. Jeffries. It is the eighth poorest state in the country, according to this document. Is Alabama a right-to-work state, Mr. Mix?    Mr. Mix. Yes, sir.    Mr. Jeffries. And is Alabama one of the poorest states in the country?    Mr. Mix. Yes. But it is important to note that Alabama has a union density higher than many states that do not have right-to-work laws, sir.    Mr. Jeffries. Okay. And is Arkansas a right-to-work state?    Mr. Mix. Yes, sir.    Mr. Jeffries. Is Arkansas one of the poorest states in the country?    Mr. Mix. I do not know that to be true.    Mr. Jeffries. It is actually number two. And let's get to the penultimate question that you anticipated. Is Mississippi a right-to-work state, sir?    Mr. Mix. Yes, sir.    Mr. Jeffries. And is Mississippi the poorest state in the union?    Mr. Mix. I believe that your table would indicate that.    Mr. Jeffries. Thank you. I yield back.
