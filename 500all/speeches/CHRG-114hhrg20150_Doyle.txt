    Mr. Doyle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would like to thank you for holding this hearing today and to thank our witnesses for testifying.    I am glad we are considering this important reauthorization legislation and I think the discussion draft under consideration represents a good first step in the process.    Administrator Dominguez, I am concerned that PHMSA is still far from completing mandates instituted under the Pipeline Safety Act of 2011. Overdue regulations include those related to leak detection and emergency shutoff valves, as well as public education and awareness efforts.    What are the biggest challenges facing you right now in getting these completed?    Mr. Doyle. So what assistance can our committee provide to ensure that this is done as quickly and responsibly as possible? How can we be of assistance to you in that regard?    Mr. Doyle. I want to also ask you about emergency order authority and authority other administrators enjoy. Can you describe in greater detail potential events that could justify the use of such authority and how having such an authority would be beneficial in those circumstances?    Mr. Doyle. Thank you. I am also interested in LNG exports and certainly share your support for strong safety standards in this area. Are there particular areas within this subject that you think require additional direction from our committee or the administration?    Mr. Doyle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
