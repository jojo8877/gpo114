    Ms. Graham. First, thank you very much for being here this morning.    You have touched a bit on other terrorist groups in the region. Could you please provide an update on Hezbollah?    Thank you.    General Flynn. I will give it a shot, and you guys can talk.    I mean, so Hezbollah is an Iranian-backed group. I believe we are still designating them as a terrorist organization, our State Department.    Hezbollah is deeply involved in Syria. So they are fighting in Syria. Members of Hezbollah are fighting, and they are actually leading and doing some of the, sort of, what I would call special-operations-type training of some of the Syrian forces.    Hezbollah is involved in Yemen. Hezbollah is certainly involved in Lebanon and some of the disruption of things in that particular country. And Hezbollah is involved in Iraq, as well. So members of Hezbollah are, in fact, inside of Iraq fighting with what I would describe as what we used to call the Badr Corps organization, which we know is led by members of Iran's IRGC .    So Hezbollah is a very dangerous organization. They are responsible for killing many, many Americans, and we need to not let them, sort of, get a pass on any of this.    Ms. Graham. Thank you. I appreciate the update.    The Chairman. Mr. Wittman.
