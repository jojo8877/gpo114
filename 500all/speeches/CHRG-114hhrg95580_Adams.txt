    Ms. ADAMS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Velazquez, for hosting this hearing.    Tax burden on small businesses buried in the complexities of the tax system is something that we must tackle head on. The state of North Carolina is home to more than 800,000 small businesses, which means that there are more than 800,000 small firms in my home state that potentially have tax compliance issues, including cost burdens associated with tax compliance.    Mr. Williamson, how should the current tax code be altered to reduce that cost burden for small businesses?    Ms. ADAMS. Okay.    Estimates by Internal Revenue Service of the size and the composition of the federal tax gap indicate that small businesses organized as a pass-through entity account for a substantial share of that gap. Their contributions are thought to be the result of honest mistakes born of the complexity of the code and tax evasion tied to cash payments for goods and services. How should the federal tax code be reformed to reduce noncompliance by small businesses?    Mr. Williamson?    Ms. ADAMS. Okay. I have one final question.    Minority firms often have an even harder time getting off the ground and then staying afloat than other demographics of small businesses, particularly as it relates to lending.    For Mr. Williamson and Mr. Mihm, have you studied the impact that tax compliance has on minority-owned firms, and if so, what is the rate of minority-owned firms closing their businesses as a result of the difficulty in the tax compliance compared to white-owned firms?    Ms. ADAMS. Would either of the other gentlemen like to respond?    Ms. ADAMS. Okay.    One challenge to tax compliance for small businesses may be that the tax code has no uniform definition of a small business, so how should small businesses be defined for tax purposes?    Ms. ADAMS. Would either of the other gentlemen like to respond?    Ms. ADAMS. Thank you.
