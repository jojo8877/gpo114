    Mr. Graves. Welcome, everyone. The subcommittee will come to order, and we will begin our hearings on fiscal year 2017's budget requests of the various agencies of the legislative branch.    I look forward to continuing our work with all the members of the subcommittee, including our ranking member, Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, our vice chairman, Mr. Amodei; Mr. Rigell of Virginia; Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia; Mr. Palazzo of Mississippi, welcome you back; and Mr. Farr of California; Ms. McCollum of Minnesota.    I want to thank each of you for being here and appreciate your dedication and attention to the important issues of this subcommittee.    And as everyone of this subcommittee knows, our national debt is at the tune of now $19 trillion, and as we all know, this is unsustainable and unacceptable. While major reforms to the Federal programs outside the jurisdiction of this committee are certainly needed, we nonetheless must lead by example, and we will.    The budget that was submitted by the administration for this subcommittee to consider, not including the Senate items, or under the Architect of the Capitol for the Senate, is $3.6 billion, which is an increase of 6.8 percent over last year's enacted level. So when you include the Senate, the request is at $4.7 billion, or an increase of just over 6 percent over last year's enacted level.    Now, our job is going to be to scrutinize the request under our jurisdiction, and we will continue to lead by example by being efficient, effective, and doing more with less, as we have done in the past. I appreciate the hard work done to prepare these budget requests, and I look forward to the hearings from each of the agencies.    Now, today, we have with us the United States Capitol Police, the Chief of Police--thank you for being here, Mr. Dine; Assistant Chief Matthew Verderosa, who will be taking over as Chief--we congratulate you--on March 20; and Mr. Braddock, the Chief Administrative Officer.    This will be Chief Dine's last testimony before this subcommittee.    And we are grateful for your service, Chief, in your capacity now. I know it is since December 2012, you were appointed to serve as the Chief of Police for the United States Capitol Police.    Now, during his tenure with the Capitol Police, he has overseen the 57th inaugural event of the President of the United States, 4 State of the Union addresses, thousands of visits from heads of state, dignitaries, and VIPs, joint meetings, summits, events, and demonstrations, over 30 million screenings for the Capitol complex in total, and the day-to-day operations of running a police department.    Chief, well done. Thank you. All of us on the subcommittee would like to thank you for your hard work and your dedication to the safety and the security of the entire Capitol complex, and we would also like to thank the officers and the civilians of the Capitol Police for their service.    Their presence has allowed Members and staff to safely conduct the people's work and ensure that all visitors can safely enjoy this rich history of the Capitol that we all endure and love.    Now, your budget request for fiscal 2017 is $409.6 million. This is an increase of just under $35 million, or around 9 percent, over last year's level. And while we understand your critical mission to ensure that our Nation's legislative and democratic process of government are conducted without disruption, our job, obviously, is to scrutinize this request and to make informed funding decisions as we move forward.    So with that, I would like to conclude my opening remarks and ask Ms. Wasserman Schultz, ranking member, if she has anything she would like to add, and then certainly recognize the ranking member of the full committee afterwards, Mrs. Lowey.         Opening Statement of Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz    Mr. Graves. Thank you, Ms. Wasserman Schultz.    And I am delighted to have us with us the ranking member of the full committee, Mrs. Lowey.    Thank you for joining us.               Opening Statement of Ranking Member Lowey    Mr. Graves. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey.    And, Chief Dine, now if you would like to give us a presentation of your written statement you have already submitted. I know that that is being submitted as part of the record, but we look forward to hearing from you as you want to describe some of your plans looking ahead and your final hearing and testimony.                     Statement of Chief Kim C. Dine    Mr. Graves. Thank you, Chief, for your testimony, and also you took a moment there to summarize your tenure and experience and a lot of the accomplishments you have seen and participated in. I really, on the onset, only have one quick question for you, and then I will go to Ms. Wasserman Schultz next.    As you leave and as you are, so to speak, passing the baton to your right, what challenges do you foresee that you feel comfortable in sharing, that are looking at us in the horizon, aside from monetary, budgetary, those kind of things, but more just some of the physical threats or challenges you see that we should be aware of?    Mr. Graves. Well, thank you. I know that myself and many of the members of the subcommittee had the opportunity to visit the headquarters and were greatly impressed with the assets, the intelligence, the information, all that you are working with and coordinating to keep this a safe environment, given all the threats you have identified.    Knowing that we have votes coming up at some point later this afternoon, I respect everybody's opportunity to have questions here.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz, let's go to you next, and then we will go around the room some.    Mr. Graves. Thank you, Chief. And I think from the onset I mentioned there would be some scrutiny in questions, and as demonstrated with the brilliant questions coming from Ms. Wasserman Schultz, with brilliant answers, obviously, from the Chief.    Mr. Amodei has indicated he has no questions at this time, but----    Mr. Graves. Mr. Palazzo is next in the queue.    Mr. Graves. Anything else?    Mr. Graves. Yes. All right.    Mr. Graves. That might be a different setting, yes.    Mr. Farr.    Mr. Graves. I appreciate you bringing that up. That is the plan. That is probably likely after your question. We will see. Maybe Mr. Jenkins will have a question, and then we can go vote. We will suspend, recess for a moment, and then return.    Mr. Graves. Mr. Farr, before you go on to your next question, I am watching the vote clock behind you.    And Mr. Jenkins, if he could get in any kind of comment or question you have before we recess and come back, the chief and his team will still be here, and we will continue if that is OK with Mr. Farr.    Mr. Jenkins.    Mr. Graves. OK. Thank you, Mr. Jenkins.    Well, this committee will stand in recess until we return, and we will be back in not too long, I would hope. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes, Chief.    Thank you all very much. We stand in recess.    Wednesday, March 2, 2016.                  Opening Statement of Chairman Graves    Mr. Graves. I will go ahead and call the subcommittee to order. Welcome, everyone.    Today we will begin our hearings on the Fiscal Year 2017 Budget Request of the House of Representatives. I would like to welcome the officers of the House.    Ms. Haas, thank you for joining us, Clerk of the House.    Sergeant Paul Irving, Sergeant at Arms, thank you.    And, our new Chief Administrative Officer, Mr. Plaster. Welcome. Congratulations to you on your new assignment. I look forward to working with you.    Also in attendance we have Mr. Kerry Kircher, the General Counsel; Ms. Strokoff, who is Legislative Counsel; and Mr. Seep, who is Law Revision Counsel. I also understand that we have Ms. Theresa Grafenstine, the Inspector General, with us as well.    So thank you, everyone, for joining us.    This 2017 budget request for the House agencies is just under $1.2 billion, which is a little over $6 million more than last year's enacted amount. Much of the work that each of you and your offices do on a daily basis in an ideal world is certainly invisible. And if everything goes well, your work stays behind the scenes and generally unnoticed.    However, we wanted you to know that this committee appreciates you and all the work you do for the House; and to keep the House secure, virtually and physically, and to ensure that we have all the proper tools. So we certainly recognize all the work you do for our work environment and keeping the environment safe.    So, I look forward to working with each of you as we have certainly some challenges facing us in this fiscal year 2017. As we had a discussion yesterday, obviously there will be questions, and our job is to review the request and scrutinize where possible and save taxpayer dollars where possible. But I know that you all have presented something that is responsible, that accomplishes the objectives you have in mind. The committee will certainly take that into consideration.    And at this point, I would like to welcome our ranking member, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, for any remarks she might have.         Opening Statement of Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz    Mr. Graves. Thank you, Ms. Wasserman Schultz.    And now we will take an opportunity to hear from the officers. I would love to start with Ms. Haas first, ladies first, and then Mr. Irving and then Mr. Plaster. If each of you could just go in that order, and then we can have questions after that. Members will likely direct questions to one or all of you at some point.    My understanding is our calendar, as long as yours allows for it, goes to about 2:30, that is what we were expecting here, no later than that, then we will have Library of Congress after that. So that sort of gives the Members a lay of the land here.    So, Ms. Haas, thanks for joining us, and look forward to your comments. If you can briefly share what you have already prepared and know that your written statement will be submitted for the record.                  Opening Remarks--Clerk of the House    Mr. Graves. Thank you.    Mr. Irving, thank you.                Opening Remarks--House Sergeant at Arms    Mr. Graves. Thank you, Mr. Irving. Thank you for your service too.    Mr. Graves. Mr. Plaster, welcome. Your first hearing before us in your new capacity.    Mr. Graves. And we certainly congratulate you and welcome you.    Mr. Graves. Thank you very much.    I know each of the members of the committee have done their diligence and read through each of your proposals and recommendations from the budget requests. I want to start off today, I am going to yield my time to Mr. Rigell, who is a great advocate of good government and has done an amazing job on the Appropriations Committee. We were sad to see him announce that he wasn't going to run again this year.    Mr. Graves. You have been a great member of the committee and we appreciate you.    Mr. Graves. Thank you, Mr. Rigell.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz.    Mr. Graves. Ms. Wasserman Schultz, let me hit the pause button----    Mr. Graves. I can understand that and sense that and understand the Sergeant to say he takes responsibility for the decisions that have been made, and he made that clear.    Mr. Graves. And let's all keep in mind that the Sergeant at Arms and his team has a responsibility to keep this complex safe.    Mr. Graves. I wouldn't suggest that he was anything but truthful. He took responsibility, is how I understood it to be.    Mr. Graves. Mr. Palazzo.    Mr. Graves. We will see how you do.    Mr. Graves. Ten?    Mr. Graves. It comes out of your MRA, by the way.    Mr. Graves. Another thought-provoking questioner of our committee, Mr. Farr, who has served well for many, many years.    this is your last term as well. We appreciate your work on the committee.                           Remarks--Mr. Farr    Mr. Graves. Mr. Farr, you have done a great job of taking us exactly to 2:30.    Mr. Graves. And I appreciate that.    Mr. Graves. I know Ms. Wasserman Schultz does as well. And as I think about this, and I know we do have the Library of Congress next, there is probably more to discuss, I would suspect, and I am open to that. And if the Sergeant at Arms is open to that, I would suggest that we meet together again at another time and.    Mr. Graves. We can have that--why don't you and I have that discussion together, because I think you bring up some fair points, Mr. Farr does, and there might be other members on our side that would have some other questions as well. But as we end the committee.    Mr. Graves. You think so?    Mr. Graves. If we can----    Mr. Graves. I would suspect to lengthen this meeting a little we would have to shorten the questions a lot, because our questions tend to be very long.    Mr. Graves. I understand.    Let me say for the Sergeant at Arms real quick, just hearing the discourse here a second, I don't in any way want you to sense that there is disrespect for what you or your team does. We are grateful for the security you provide. And, I don't personally believe it is the role of this committee to micromanage each and every activity you do. It is, obviously, our role to take heed to the requests you have made, the spending, and then to make our recommendation back as we pass the bill through.    But I suspect there is an opportunity for each of us to get back together to maybe resolve some of the questions that are still outstanding.    Mr. Graves. You have a very challenging role, but a great track record with this complex. We are grateful for that.    So one question each? Is that what I understand?    Mr. Palazzo, you have a question for anyone else on the panel?    Mr. Graves. Ms. Wasserman Schultz.    Mr. Graves. You asking them together, jointly?    Mr. Graves. OK.    Mr. Graves. Mr. Plaster, real quick. The question on the dollars from 2011 forward. If you happen to have that, feel free to share that figure. I imagine that is a pretty simple number.    Mr. Graves. And then I know the cafeteria question is something you are probably prepared to give a bit of response to. And then the other questions, I don't know if you are ready for a response today.    Mr. Graves. And welcome to your first hearing.    Mr. Graves. Mr. Farr, you had an additional question.    Mr. Graves. That it, Mr. Farr?    Mr. Graves. I would recommend also, and we can do this from our office, is just reach out to the House Administration Committee as well. They are heavily involved in formulating what MRAs are comprised of for each and every Member based on some formulary calculation that is adjusted based on cost of living and other things. That is my understanding.    Mr. Graves. That is quite possible. As you will recall, the Senate has not cut any spending in the Senate or Senate offices or any of their funds or COLAs since, I guess, since 2010. While we have taken the 21 percent cuts, they, in fact, were increasing their office budget.                                          Wednesday, March 2, 2016.                  Opening Statement of Chairman Graves    Mr. Graves. If everyone is ready, we will start our next hearing. Thank you for joining us today.    We would like to welcome acting Librarian of Congress David Mao and the Library's Chief of Staff, Robert Newlen. Thank you all for being with us today and for your patience as we were getting through the last hearing.    We will start this panel concerning the Library's 2017 budget request, and then we will have an additional panel after we go through some of the questions with the Library itself, and that is to discuss bringing the Copyright Office into the digital age.    I am personally pleased to see that the Library is positioning itself for the future through a lot of the critical improvements to its information technology. It is something I know we discussed a lot last year. Additionally, the Library continues to make available its collections in digital as well as physical form, all while transitioning to the new leadership.    The Library is requesting $667 million, which is an increase of over $73 million from 2016's appropriation. That is just over a 11 percent increase that they are requesting. And as we have shared with all the panels before us, obviously that is your request. Our role, and as you have seen and heard, is to question, scrutinize, and see if there are areas of savings that we can achieve for the taxpayers, but also respecting that your request was put forward in good faith in order to carry out the acts and the duties that you see fit.    And next, I would like to welcome Ms. Wasserman Schultz for any opening remarks she might have.for in the omnibus on Friday. I am looking forward to reviewing it.    Finally, as a result of our bill, the public will provide comments on ideas for funding strategies to accomplish this critical modernization. Ultimately, it will require some combination of Federal appropriations and increases in user fees. We should have those comments back before we mark up a bill. So we have a lot of ground to cover today with the Register, and I look forward to hearing from both panels of witnesses.    Mr. Graves. Thank you.    We will invite Ms. Pallante to join Mr. Mao in a few minutes, after we go through this panel, but feel free to summarize your statement and know that your statement will be submitted for the record as well as your statement for the Register of Copyrights and the Director of CRS.         Opening Statement of the Acting Librarian of Congress    Mr. Graves. Great. Thank you. Thank you for your statement there.    And I was just thinking back as you were giving your comments there, I know in the past you have generally sat in that seat and with Dr. Billington sitting where you are. So it is big shoes you are filling, I know a big void, but tremendous history and heritage that he has provided, and we are grateful for that. And appreciate you stepping in during this interim period and look forward to continuing working with you.    Quick question from my end and then I will go to Mr. Palazzo, I will yield the rest of my time to Mr. Palazzo, if you have a question.    Last year, a lot of focus was spent on protection of books and manuscripts and such through the deacidification process. What is the plan for fiscal year 2017? Is it maintaining the 200,000-book level of protection?    Mr. Graves. And you suspect you will stay on the goal? I know that you have a lot to get to over the years.    Mr. Graves. Are there objectives, number of books or manuscripts over time?    Mr. Graves. Thank you.    Mr. Palazzo, I yield the rest of my time to you.    Mr. Graves. Ms. Wasserman Schultz.    Mr. Graves. Thank you. Yes, well said.    In addition to, I think it is not the intent of this committee to put any additional duties or responsibilities or CRS whatsoever. You are doing a great job with limited resources, and we are grateful for that. And I have read your testimonies. Remarkable work.    Mr. Graves. We are very limited here.    Mr. Farr.    Mr. Graves. I don't know. We will have to get back with you on that one. The question continues, yes.    Mr. Graves. Mr. Farr, we actually have one more panel, if you are open to inviting Ms. Pallante up, and we will ease into the next panel.    Doctor, thank you very much for all you are doing, for answering the questions.    Mr. Graves. You could. Could I invite Ms. Pallante up to join the panel.    Mr. Graves. So it will take time, still a little more time.    Mr. Graves. That is good news. Good news.    Well, one other question, then Ms. Wasserman Schultz.    What I hear probably the most about when it comes to the Copyrights is why is there not an updated searchable registration system that is available to all the users who are really trying to use a system correctly and not violate anyone's copyrights?    Mr. Graves. Maybe I left out a phrase, maybe updated and searchable.    Mr. Graves. I understand that something can be searchable, but if something is current today, is it available and searchable on the other end today? That that might be the question.    Mr. Graves. A day or 2 or a month.    Mr. Graves. Is that true with music or everything?    Mr. Graves. Thank you for your explanation.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz.    Mr. Graves. Mr. Farr, any questions?    Did you have anything you wanted to add, Mr. Mao?    Anything additional?    Mr. Graves. Great. Well, if there are no other questions, let me thank you all for joining us today, for working together for the betterment of what we are all trying to do here for our constituency across the country. And we will stand in recess until we are called back.
