    Ms. Adams. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    And, Dr. King, thank you for testifying today and for speaking with the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus a few weeks ago. It was a pleasure to have you there and to know that we have a bipartisan group of members on both sides of the aisle who are very interested in this issue. I'm encouraged as well that you will do well with your confirmation, and congratulations.    As you know, and many of my colleagues know, HBCUs have been a priority of mine for a while. So I was pleased to see the new HBCU/MSI Innovation for Completion Fund, and within it the First in the World Program and the support for HBCUs. So could you talk a little bit more about the decision to create the program and support for HBCUs and ways that the Department can work to address the funding discrepancies that have historically existed for these schools?    Ms. Adams. Okay. Let me ask you another question which has to do with the decision the administration made 5 years ago to cut $10 million from the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement TRIO program, which prepares low-income first-generation minority students for graduate studies. And so I understand that at that time the administration made the decision to support efforts to improve STEM-based programs and to help the Nation address the decline in our country's STEM-trained graduates by focusing on students earlier in the pipeline. So the direct result was the loss of the opportunity for future scholars to pursue a graduate degree, which included the program at Dr. McNair's and my alma mater, North Carolina A&T, which sits in my district.    Given that Congress afforded a $60 million funding increase to TRIO last year, will you consider restoring this program?
