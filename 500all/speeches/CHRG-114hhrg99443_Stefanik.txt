    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to echo my friend and colleague, Mr. Courtney's, statements that the heroin and opioid epidemic is an issue that I have been focused on in my district, and I look forward to working with you on that issue.    Thank you, Madam Secretary, for being here today. Shifting gears, I think we can all agree here that we need to make sure that our seniors receive the best care possible, and in order to do that, we must accept there are differing needs across this country.    The Older Americans Act is an important law that helps seniors remain in their homes and out of expensive institutional care. As you know, what may work for seniors receiving meals or care in urban areas is likely to be inadequate to the unique challenges facing rural areas such as the district I represent in New York's North country, where we have one of the highest concentrations of seniors in New York State.    One of the hallmarks of the Older Americans Act is the State and local control provided through the structure of the aging network. This is a great example of legislation that understands one-size-fits-all does not always work.    Can you speak to how this structure is important to meeting the needs of this Nation's elderly and what we will do to continue the successful model?    Ms. Stefanik. Great. Thank you for that, and I yield back.
