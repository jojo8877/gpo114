    Dr. Heck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you all for being here today. The President recently released his 2015 National Security Strategy. And on the White House Website, it states that the strategy is ``the blueprint for America's leadership in the world--how we address global challenges while advancing our Nation's interests, values, and vision for the future.''    On page 3 of the strategy, it says, ``We are leading a global campaign and degrading and ultimately defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.''    And on page 15, it states, ``We reject the lie that America and its allies are at war with Islam.''    I would disagree with the first statement. I don't think we are leading in trying to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL, but I would agree with the second statement that we are not at war with all of Islam. We are at war with radical Islam and Islamic extremism, yet nowhere in the strategy does that term appear. In fact, the only two times that the word ``Islam'' appears in the strategy are in the two instances I just mentioned, yet climate change appears 19 times.    I would ask, Do you think the National Security Strategy has enough specificity to adequately inform the nested documents of the National Defense Strategy and the National Military Strategy to actually have a positive impact on executing a strategy for degrading and ultimately defeating     And, secondly, Dr. Lynch, I would ask in your statement about the momentum of ISIL being halted. Just within the last 24 hours, they have taken control of the city of al-Baghdadi, and they are knocking on the door of the Al Asad Air Base, where we have 320 Marines in a training capacity. How can you say that the momentum has actually been halted?
