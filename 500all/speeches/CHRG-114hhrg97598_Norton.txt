    Ms. Norton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This discussion about undocumented criminals, violence of course on the border, raises the question for me of the role that consulates play with respect to security, particularly in northern Mexico.    Now, as I understand it, Mr. Starr, the security agencies, the law enforcement agencies, are coordinated or facilitated through the consulate. I have in mind Customs and Border Protection, Drug Enforcement Agency, Immigration, of course, and Customs Enforcement, Marshal Service, is the consulate the place where these agencies would be stationed?    Ms. Norton. Mr. Starr, what I'm trying to get at is, you know, the average American if you say what's a consulate for would think about visas and tourism and the rest. We're talking about violence, undocumented criminals, and the rest; and I'm trying to get at what we're doing on the ground in Mexico through our consulates and the role they play.    Now, the United States I think, Mr. Starr, has wisely tried to involve itself in reform of the criminal justice system in Mexico itself in order to truly get at drug trafficking, gun trafficking, organized crime, which of course is always at the top of our agenda. And I'd like to ask you in that regard about the so-called Merida Initiative, which as I understand it, is charged with disrupting criminal organizations, strengthening judicial institutions in Mexico, improving stability in the surrounding communities.    Ms. Saarnio, or Mr. Starr, does that sound like what the Merida Initiative is about?    Ms. Norton. What impact would closing the consulates have on an initiative like the Merida Initiative?    Ms. Norton. Is the Consulate where they're based?    Ms. Norton. What impact has it had so far on security in the region?    Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
