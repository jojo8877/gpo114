    Mrs. Lawrence. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Talk about the issue of access through the IDs, on March 9, 2015, NBC News reported that 1,400 badges that granted access to secure areas had gone missing over a 2-year period. Are you familiar with this report, Mr. Roth?    Mrs. Lawrence. What happens when an ID badge is lost or reported stolen?    Mrs. Lawrence. Do you know how the airports keep track of this? Are you engaged in that tracking process?    Mrs. Lawrence. So that's my followup. When the TSA is supposed to come behind, so there is an audit process that is given to any airport. Is there an inspection process? How do you know that--how do you verify that the airports are in compliance, because the concern that we have about these missing ID badges is we provide all the security under TSA that we have the expectations, how do--how does TSA verify that there's an inspection needed because the audit has failed? And what is the procedure?    Mrs. Lawrence. How frequently?    Mrs. Lawrence. I just want to say that I'm glad to hear that you are conducting the audit of that process. It is disturbing to me that the access to secure areas, this number is too high. And in doing that audit I really want to State for the record that I feel it's too high. You're going to have to convince me otherwise.    And things like the frequency, when is there accountability issued for the airports and for employees for these loss of badges. And the question of the answer after a certain period that everyone gets their badges reissued, how frequently is that happening? And what triggers that number?    So those are the concerns I have. As we are--it should be a comprehensive approach. I would hope that the media would not drive our response to these issues, that's troubling to me. It should have been something that has been triggered by our own internal audits, if we are doing that, instead of saying, oh, it's in the media now, we need to respond. So thank you.
