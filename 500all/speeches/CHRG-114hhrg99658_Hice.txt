    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thanks to both our witnesses for your testimony here today.    Ms. Book, I would like to draw some answers from you. Just overall, what is the role of the Office of Professional Responsibility?    Mr. Hice. Okay. At what point do you get involved with an allegation?    Mr. Hice. So what kind of jurisdiction do you have? If not investigations, what do you do?    Mr. Hice. All right. So you have a certain degree of latitude, then, so far as disciplinary action and that type of thing.    Mr. Hice. Is there a scale to determine what kind of disciplinary action there is based on certain behavior?    Mr. Hice. Okay. So if there is some disciplinary action or corrective action that you take, does the employee have a right to appeal?    Mr. Hice. Okay. So, by the time all the written and oral replies, what kind of timeframe are we looking at for an appeal process?    Mr. Hice. It could take a lengthy time.    Mr. Hice. Okay. How long does it--on your side, how long does it take to recommend disciplinary action?    Mr. Hice. Okay.    Does your disciplinary action include removal of employees? And if so, what is the cost? What's involved in removing someone?    Mr. Hice. Yes, just the process, is that a big deal? Does it cost the agency time and money on research, investigation? Of course, you don't do all the investigation, but is it a big deal to have someone removed?    Mr. Hice. Do you feel you have the sufficient tools needed to proceed with adequate and sufficient disciplinary action when needed?    Mr. Hice. Okay. So you would not think from our perspective there is more that should be done; you have everything you need to deal with the issues, like what we're talking about today.    Mr. Hice. Okay. All right. Thank you very much.    And, Chairman, I yield back.
