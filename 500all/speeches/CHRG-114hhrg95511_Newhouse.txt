    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate everybody being here this morning. As Chairman Conaway just said, this is an issue of very keen interest. I understand it is in many situations around the world you make even the best of a bad situation, perhaps is one way to characterize it, so I appreciate the difficulty in delivering food assistance in the most efficient method possible, but effort needs to be made to make that as good as we can.    I apologize if this question has been asked already, but much of the aid we are sending overseas is ending up in Syria, and understandably so, so I would like to ask Mr. Melito, as well as Ms. Trujillo, to talk a little bit about places like Syria, where we have inability to send personnel to actually make sure that the delivery is happening, what kind of oversight is in place to make sure that people in need are actually getting the assistance, versus perhaps some of the groups that we are actually in a continuing struggle with, such as ISIS, or the Syrian military? How can we assure the American people that aid is getting into the peoples' hands that we want it to, and not those that are trying to do us harm?    Mr. Newhouse. So what is your----    Mr. Newhouse. What is your level of comfort that the aid is actually getting where we want it to go?    Mr. Newhouse. Okay.    Mr. Newhouse. Okay.    Ms. Trujillo.--on the in-kind.    Mr. Newhouse. Before my time is up, I just wanted to ask you, Ms. Trujillo, you mentioned a shipping company that you found was overcharging, and had been for many years. Are you still using that shipping company?    Mr. Newhouse. I would be interested if you could find an answer.    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.    The Chairman. I recognize the Ranking Member of the full Committee, Mr. Peterson.
