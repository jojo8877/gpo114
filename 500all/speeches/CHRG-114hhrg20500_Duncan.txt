    Mr. Duncan. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Where are we in relation to other countries, Dr. Nield? Are any other countries further along in this area than we are?    Mr. Duncan. Well, I would have assumed that we were ahead, particularly you talked about the Russians. Their economy is in tatters, so I wouldn't expect that there would be a lot of commercial space programs over there, but I am like Mr. DeFazio, I was going to ask some questions about this indemnification procedure.    According to the information we have, it has been in effect since 1988, 28 years now, and it has not been invoked, yet it is still in the law till 2025.    I know there are some businesses and industries that the Federal Government insures but not many. Most businesses that we would--that I could go into or that anyone could go into are not insured. They are not backed up by the Federal Government.    Why is it still necessary that we place this potential liability on the taxpayers? I mean, this is--maybe it was done at the first to encourage a new industry, but when it has gone on this long----    Mr. Duncan. Yes.    Dr. Dillingham.    Mr. Duncan. All right. Thank you very much.
