    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Madam Chair.    America's national security is an issue that those of us trusted by the public to serve in Congress must and do take seriously. It is going to take all of us on both sides. But I am going to be positive and think that we will get to a deal that most of us can support. I wanted to look forward.    Saudi Arabia has said that they want the same capabilities as Iran if a deal is reached. Jordan and Egypt have hinted the same as well. Some have cited these examples as the beginning of a nuclear arms race. How serious do you think the regional actors are in pursuing their own nuclear programs? And it is open to all of you.    Ms. Kelly. Thank you.
