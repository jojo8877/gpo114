    Mr. Whitfield. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And I want to thank all of the witnesses for joining us today on this very important subject. As a matter of fact, I walked out of this hearing to go back to my office before I went to the floor for a vote, and there were a group of seven people in there who wanted to talk about this bill. So somebody is really organized today, Mr. Shimkus. But it is an important issue.    And, Mr. Jaffe, I would like to just ask for your comments. FDA has made it very clear that their current consultation process is rigorous, involves a number of experts well versed in these methods, and is entirely, to use their words, entirely sufficient for purposes of reviewing the safety of these products.    And so, if the FDA is perfectly comfortable in the process, feels that it adequately protects the public and food safety, why are you arguing for new legal authority that FDA does not believe it even needs?    Mr. Whitfield. So your primary concern is on imports?    Mr. Whitfield. And, Mr. Giddings, I get the sense that you have an opinion about this, as well. So tell me what you think about it.    Mr. Whitfield. Mr. Reifsteck, do you have a comment you would like to make on this?    Mr. Whitfield. Yes.    To the attorney general of Vermont, I am certainly not an expert in food safety. I buy a lot of food, though. But anytime you go to a store and you see on a label ``this contains such and such'' or ``this may contain such and such,'' it almost seems like it is a warning label.    And just, without giving a lot of thought to this--and that is why we enjoy these hearings--without giving a lot of thought to it, I mean, I think that is one of the primary concerns I would have about the Vermont law. It almost looks like it is a warning label. And I'm not aware of any scientific evidence that there is any safety issue involved, truthfully.    Would you want to make a comment on that?    Mr. Whitfield. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
