    Mr. Hardy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Salerno, for being here.    Most generally, in other disasters, we see a lack of communication across different Federal agencies, or stove-piping, as one of the points of failure. For instance, the issue of the 911 Commission report. In the wake of the Macondo, the response was opposite. The split-up of the former Materials and Management Service into three separate agencies, splitting up the revenue collection into a separate bureau makes sense. However, I believe the mission of safe offshore operations is not exclusive to BSEE or BOEM. Also, the factor of safety into leasing decisions and revenue exploration plans.    Would it not be beneficial to have these two agencies working in concert together, given the missions, while different, have the same end goal? Safe and measured offshore energy deployment--in fact, would safety be further enhanced by having these two agencies interact more regularly, especially because BOEM is reviewing exploration plans and BSEE is reviewing application permits? Both of these documents set plans developing prospect of the overall goal of safety does not end at the agency's doorstep.    Mr. Hardy. Another way of looking at this for me is what kind of interaction do we have between the agencies and the offshore development folks, being as how they should be the ones paying for the cost of these incidents? Are they working with you, with the agencies, to help come up with a better mousetrap, so to speak? Is that being utilized, their expertise, also?    Mr. Hardy. The private sector----    Mr. Hardy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.    The Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Grijalva.
