    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you. And I will get to the budget implications of this in just a minute, but how active are we in working with allies, NATO allies, Israel, et cetera, in combating cyber threats and cyber attacks?    Mr. Lamborn. Well, that is good to hear. And do you have any recommendations in the budget on maybe making that even stronger? Or, I mean, I know you have a good budget that you are defending right now, but do you see any room for improvement in that area in particular?    Mr. Lamborn. Okay. I appreciate that. I would like to follow up on this conversation at another time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I yield back.
