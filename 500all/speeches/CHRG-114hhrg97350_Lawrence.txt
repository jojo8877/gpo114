    Ms. LAWRENCE. Thank you. Mr. Wesley, I appreciate the fact that you are collecting information and data on the trends in the Department of Defense. We are on the same page there.    I wanted to know that when you are looking at these trends and you are actually monitoring these firms after they leave, what is the data showing? What is the data telling you?    Ms. LAWRENCE. It sounds like it is working. Why do we not have more currently participating? We have the ability for 2,000 firms; correct? We currently have 389?    Ms. LAWRENCE. What do you think--that is our buzzer.    Ms. LAWRENCE. Eighty-eight. How do we grow that?    Ms. LAWRENCE. What is your projection of when we will get to the growth phase?    Ms. LAWRENCE. Exactly.    Ms. LAWRENCE. Mr. Wesley and Mr. Shoraka, one of the frustrations I hear in the field from small businesses is that opportunities like this are available, but they cannot seem to get access to it. My job is to make sure small businesses are aware of programs. When we say it is available, if someone meets the criteria today, they will have access.    One last question to Mr. Shoraka. I am very concerned about opportunities for women owned businesses and veteran owned businesses. Specifically, how can they take advantage, and will this program be an advantage for them?    Ms. LAWRENCE. Thank you, and I yield back my time.
