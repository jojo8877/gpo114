    Mr. Veasey. Well, thank you very much.    And I wanted to ask some questions about energy storage for Dr. Hallinan and Dr. Scherson. I know that you're both working on innovations in electrical energy storage. I wanted to know if you could speak about your research and how it may lead to breakthroughs in developing new battery technologies.    Mr. Veasey. Yes, please.    Mr. Veasey. Another question I wanted to ask you was about energy storage. As we know, there are many challenges that we face when it comes to energy storage in the area of wind and solar, particularly if we want to be able to provide a certain amount for our energy grid and portfolio. Do you have--anything else of--just about the challenges that may remain that we may not be aware of?    And then also I wanted to ask you, do you think that if we're able to overcome some of the storage challenges and issues, will that allow us to be able to even use wind more efficiently? I don't know if you've ever been to a wind farm in Texas. We provide a lot of wind in the State of Texas, but they do take up quite a bit of space to get the wind from West Texas into the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, for instance. You're talking acres and acres and acres. If you could just briefly touch on that, I definitely would appreciate it.    Mr. Veasey. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield back.    Mr. Veasey. That's right.
