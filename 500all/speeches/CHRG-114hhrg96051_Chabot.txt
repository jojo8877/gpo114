    Mr. Chabot. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    I will ask probably just one question here unless I have a follow-up. And I will address it to the whole panel to the extent you would like to answer it.    My question is in regards to China's objectives with respect to Taiwan and Tibet. In your opinion, is China strengthening its diplomatic relations with countries in the Western Hemisphere at least partly in an effort to isolate Taiwan and to some degree Tibet or a free Tibet some day? If yes, how successful have they been so far? And specifically what are the benefits that China offers to Latin American countries in exchange for their support in this effort to isolate especially Taiwan, but also to some degree Tibet? Whoever wants to take it first.    Ms. Joseph-Harris.    Mr. Chabot. Thank you very much.    Yes, Dr. Peters.    Mr. Chabot. Thank you.    Dr. Ellis.    Ms. Chabot. Thank you, Doctor.    Ms. Myers, I have a little time left.    Mr. Chabot. Thank you very much.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
