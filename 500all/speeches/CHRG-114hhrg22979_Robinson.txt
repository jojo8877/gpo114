    Dr. Robinson. Thank you, Representative Graham, for what you have done on behalf of north Florida, and in particular Florida A&M University. And thank you very, very much for the novel concept of the road tour so we can tell more people in north Florida about what we do at Florida A&M University for small, large, medium farmers around the state. We are a land-grant institution and we have a statewide impact.    I guess one key point I want to make, and that is the economic impact that we have in the State of Florida. Just as an example, Florida A&M University has a Center for Viticulture. That center has led to the development of nearly 20 viticulture operations around the State of Florida. Of course, we specialize in the type of wine that doesn't grow everywhere else because of the climate in Florida. But the economic impact of the research done by Florida A&M University doesn't directly benefit us because we are prohibited from benefiting from it financially. But we have developed at least 20 wineries around the State of Florida that are making jobs available for citizens, not only up in the Panhandle, but throughout the state. And in fact, it expanded throughout the South in general.    There are vineyards and wineries in South Carolina, and our neighbors, Representative Scott up in Georgia, who are benefiting from the research done at Florida A&M University. I just want to emphasize the economic impact of these institutions in the 1890 community on the cities and towns in which we reside. Thank you.    Dr. Robinson. Mr. Chairman and Representative Davis, well, this is probably unfair, because I served as the last civilian science advisor at USDA CSREES before it transitioned into what is now NIFA. And when I came into that role, my job was to advise them on science, more broadly. But I had a particular concern about research opportunities for an 1890 community.    And one of the things that I had to do was the annual report for the National Research Initiative, as you recall. And in that report, it was fascinating to discover that the success rate of 1890 land-grant institutions in the big pool, in the AFRI, and NRI, the success rate was just as comparable as it was for an 1862.    The difference was that we were only about one percent of the applicants. And so what I did then is how do I encourage the community to submit more competitive grants over here, because some of the limitations really go to the issues around additional resources, infrastructure, and so forth, but for those of us who competed, we were just as successful. And that pretty much pans out throughout the Federal sector, with some exceptions.    However, what we have been able to do with USDA is to use the capacity-building funds that they have to enhance our competitiveness over here in the larger pools of money. And Florida A&M University too itself was just reclassified as a research 2 institution in the Carnegie Classification because of the success that we have had. And for a university of our size, that is pretty phenomenal with the resources that we have.    And that is the type of unlocked, untapped talent that is resident within all of these schools, because what really makes you great in research is having great faculty, but also having great students, right, to carry out those research agendas. And this type of program that you have would allow us to make a lot of progress on attracting the kinds of students who can engage in the world-class research that our faculty already do.
