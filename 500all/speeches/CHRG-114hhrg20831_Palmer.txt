    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Reitze, in 2014 BICEP2 experiment team announced that they had found evidence of gravitational waves, but the observations were later shown to be the result of galactic dust and were discredited. How confident are you that this or some other type of error is not responsible for the detection of gravitational waves in this case?    Mr. Palmer. I want to give you somewhat of a follow-up on that, and any of you can answer this, and that's the practical application of this because, as my colleague Mr. Massie from Kentucky and I were discussing, GPS doesn't work without relativity. Do you see any practical application of this? And I'm not implying that this is not viable for the sake of science and science--what would any of you see as a practical application?    Mr. Palmer. That doesn't mean my time's up.    Mr. Palmer. I have to credit Mr. Massie with that question. It helps to sit by a physicist from MIT.    Mr. Palmer. Engineer, okay. Dr. Shoemaker, not long after the announcement on February 11, the Indian Cabinet granted approval for LIGO-India Project. Can you give us an idea of the impact of additional observatories coming online?    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is expired.
