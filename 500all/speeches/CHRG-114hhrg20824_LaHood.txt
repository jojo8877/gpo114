    Mr. LaHood. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I want to thank the witnesses for being here and for your testimony and all the work that you do.    Dr. Shetty, question for you. There's been discussion about how the United States is losing our competitive edge with China and the United Kingdom when it comes to synthetic biology, and I guess trying to understand the reasons for that and why we're falling behind and what steps we need to take to maintain our competitive advantage in biotechnology.    Mr. LaHood. In the competition that you referenced, when did that change occur where the United States hasn't been the winner? Was that recently or 5--how long ago?    Mr. LaHood. Got you. Dr. Maxon, as a follow-up, my home State of Illinois has a large and diverse bioscience industry with over 78,000 jobs and 3,400 businesses that contribute to the State's economy as it relates to bioscience. I know you were the author of the National Bioeconomy Blueprint in 2012 that outlined steps that federal agencies should take to drive the bioeconomy in the United States. I know we referenced that a little bit earlier, but what's the status of those recommendations in that report?    Mr. LaHood. Thank you. Madam Chair, if I could ask one last question of Dr. Shetty?    Chairwoman Comstock. Okay.    Mr. LaHood. Thank you. Dr. Shetty, one of your company's projects funded by DOE ARPA program supports R&D to capture natural gas flared by shale. Can you describe how your company is using that biotechnology to conduct this work, and what have those outcomes been thus far?
