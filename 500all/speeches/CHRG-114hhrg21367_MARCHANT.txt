    Mr. MARCHANT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I thank you for being here, Dr. Cohen.    Mr. MARCHANT. This last week I read four articles about the CO-OPs. The first one was in the New York Times. The headline was ``Health Care CO-OP Closings Narrow Consumer Choices,'' not exactly a right-wing institution.    Bloomberg Business, ``Your Health Plan Will Now Destruct was the headline.    Newsweek, ``The Calamitous Collapse of the Obamacare CO-OPs,'' again, not a right-wing organization.    And the Washington Post, ``Financial Health Shaky at Many Obamacare Insurance CO-OPs.''    So do these articles make a fair representation of the status of what is going on with the CO-OP Program?    Mr. MARCHANT. Is your agency looking to use the surplus in the transitional reinsurance program to support the CO-OPs that remain open?    Mr. MARCHANT. No, use the surplus.    Mr. MARCHANT. So if you took the amount of money that was lost, would you agree that the $1,072,000,000 number is correct about the amount that was lost last year?    Mr. MARCHANT. That money will go back into the fund?    Mr. MARCHANT. To the Treasury or will it go back to into----    Mr. MARCHANT . A revolving fund that goes out to the other CO-OPs?    Mr. MARCHANT. Is 400,000 a correct number to use? Is that participants who have lost or is that the number of policies that have been lost?    Mr. MARCHANT. Well, if you took that number and divided using 400,000 into the amount of money lost, it is about $2,700.    Mr. MARCHANT. And my last question is: using the business metaphor, when you inject this loan in there, you have to have some repayment scheme in mind. The insurance companies have to have some eventual repayment of this money that they presented you or did you make them in their business plan tell you when and under what circumstances they would pay the money back?
