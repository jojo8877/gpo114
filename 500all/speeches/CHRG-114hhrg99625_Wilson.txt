    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And, Admiral, General, thank you so much for your service. I want to thank you, the service members, military families. What a commitment of protecting American families, also protecting our great allies.    And, Admiral Harris, I am particularly grateful that I have had the opportunity to visit with you in the past. And, to me, you are a living example of America's alliance with Japan. It is just, to me, so historic and inspiring to know that we have a Japanese-American as the U.S. Pacific commander at Pearl Harbor. How far we have come. And just being in your presence has just been so positive and has to be reassuring to the people all over Asia.    Also, I am very grateful that my family has had an association with Asia. My dad served in the Flying Tigers during World War II, and I grew up hearing from him a great affection for the people of China and the people of India. And so I am hopeful that indeed positive can continue to advance, but with that in mind, Admiral, I appreciate your interest in maintaining our technological superiority, and later today, there will be a subcommittee hearing of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee on the Department of Defense science and technology programs. These issues continue to be of crucial importance to this committee, particularly the chairman, and this is key to our warfighters' future success.    Could you please describe what do you see as the right balance between investing in future capabilities, like the third offset strategy, and getting the commander what he needs now? How has the fiscal year 2017 budget request prioritized the modernization affecting your command?    Mr. Wilson. Absolutely.    Mr. Wilson. And we look forward to your input.    And, General Scaparrotti, China and North Korea's increased utilization of hybrid warfare, are we prepared for cyber warfare potential on the Korean Peninsula?    General Scaparrotti. Sir, it is one of my concerns, given that North Korea has made a deliberate effort to improve their capabilities as much as they can. Kim Jong-un has stated that. And, as you know, he has demonstrated their capability with Sony and the attack on South Korea's media and banking industries in 2013. So I am very concerned about it.    I would answer your question and say, yes, I believe we are prepared today on our--you know, defense of our military systems and within the cyber domain, but it is a rapidly developing domain and area that we have to stay on it every day. We specifically have been working on our joint cyber center. I recently have been added a cyber mission team specifically for Korea, and that is building now. That is a great addition to our capability.    I would mention to you that I also have another concern, and that is that I am within an alliance, the ROK's capability and ours, so we are collaborating with their joint cyber center as well to make sure that we don't have a vulnerability because of our combined systems, et cetera, and that is work that we need to continue to do.    Mr. Wilson. Thank you.    The Chairman. Mr. Larsen.    Mr. Wilson. North Korea is seen as a technologically backward nation, and yet there is a growing presence of computers and other digital media devices that serve as a widow to the outside world. Do you see a way this be used to increase their awareness about the outside world, and help to break the information blockade their government tries to impose on them?    General Scaparrotti. As a result of increased electronic media in North Korea--including cell phones that number in the millions--outside information is indeed much more prevalent than in the past. Strong ideological campaigns backed by Kim Jong Un's documented and aggressive use of corporal and capital punishment, however, have limited the impacts of this outside information on North Korean society and leadership. Computers, in particular, are overwhelmingly tied to a nation-wide ``intra-net'' and cannot access the world wide web--only a few computers in select organizations have internet access. We do believe the North's leadership is concerned and sensitive to the type of information its citizens are receiving. It is indeed a regime vulnerability, albeit one Pyongyang has successfully controlled to date. Increased efforts targeting this vulnerability would add additional stress to the regime.                                 ______
