    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    It is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Phil Giudice, the CEO of Ambri, and a constituent of mine from Wayland, Massachusetts. Ambri is a technology company in Massachusetts that is creating cost-effective and reliable battery technology that has the potential to revolutionize the grid. Phil, in addition to leading Ambri, has more than 30 years of experience throughout the energy industry. He has worked as a geologist, a consultant, a manager, and a public servant. I will highlight just a few of his many, many accomplishments on his resume. Phil is a Board Member for FirstFuel, an efficiency startup; Advanced Energy Economy, an energy business leadership trade group; and the New England Clean Energy Council. He was an appointee to the Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewables Advisory Committee, as well as its State Energy Advisory Board. And he has served the Commonwealth as Undersecretary of Energy, and Commissioner of the State's Department of Energy Resources. I want to thank you, Phil, and the entire panel for joining us today, and we look forward to your testimony.    I yield back.
