    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Madam Chair, for your dynamic leadership.    Secretary Patterson, you have provided that the top line for the State Department and for the Agency of International Development will have a budget of over $50 billion with around $35 billion in the base budget and $15 billion in OCO. I have seen firsthand America being successful in the Middle East and around the world to aid our allies for their citizens to have fulfilling lives.    The budget number is particularly significant this year because of the threat of Iran who stands to gain as much or two or three times this amount in cash windfall due to unfrozen assets as part of the tragic Iranian nuclear deal. We have seen Iranian support and financing of the Houthi rebels in Yemen, funding and support for Hamas in Hezbollah, providing rockets to threaten Israel, funding for terrorists and insurgents in Iraq, and support for Afghani Taliban for their terrorist activities. All of these groups have a goal of killing American military and bringing mass murder to families at home in the United States.    The concerns of Congress of the failing Iranian nuclear deal have been bipartisan. I particularly appreciate today the ranking member Ted Deutch raising issues and concerns. With all the United States can accomplish in the Middle East with the funding that we are providing, the damage that Iran stands to do in the region with $150 billion of cash windfall is dangerous. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the committee in ensuring proper oversight of the implementation of the bizarre Iranian nuclear deal.    Thank you.
