    Mr. Carter. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, gentleman, for being here today. We appreciate your presence.    Let me ask you, Dr. Moure-Eraso, getting back to January 28 when, the motion was made to consolidate some powers, do you think that was a pretty significant motion that was made that day? Pretty significant change; would you agree?    Mr. Carter. I'm sorry, I didn't understand you.    Mr. Carter. I'm talking about the change that was made. The change, was it significant? Would you consider it significant----    Mr. Carter. Who made it? Who made the motion?    Mr. Carter. No, no, no. Who made the motion?    Mr. Carter. By Mr. Ehrlich.    Mr. Carter. Mr. Ehrlich, let me ask you, you made that motion on January 28, right?    Mr. Carter. When did you join the Board?    Mr. Carter. You were appointed in December 2014, and then you made what is admittedly, by the director, a significant motion, a significant change. Is that correct?    Mr. Carter. Now, that's pretty quick. You're pretty aggressive there. Let me ask you, you were appointed. Who appointed you? How did you get appointed?    Mr. Carter. OK.    Mr. Carter. And during that confirmation process, did you ever--did you ever discuss what you--I mean, obviously, you've been thinking about doing this. Did you ever discuss that?    Mr. Carter. Did you discuss it with anyone before you made such a significant motion?    Mr. Carter. Internally. With who?    Mr. Carter. So you did discuss it with the Chair that you were going to make this motion, and I assume he was in agreement with that?    Mr. Carter. Was anyone in opposition to it? Did you talk to anyone who said, No, I don't think that's a good idea?    Mr. Carter. OK. But you went ahead and did it anyway?    Mr. Carter. You know, again, I find that--that significant, to say the least. Did anyone help you with it, or you just came up with that on your own?    Mr. Carter. Who helped you?    Mr. Carter. So the Chair did help you in crafting this motion?    Mr. Carter. You know, that's--that's pretty significant. It seems--so would you--would you say that you had an agenda when you came on the Board?    Mr. Carter. OK. But were you aware of what existed at the time? I mean, after only 3 weeks, you know, I'm not sure how aware you could have been, and when I'm talking about then, I'm talking about the morale of the employees, about just what has obviously here been described as a very, very disruptive work force.    Mr. Carter. So understanding that a lot of the concern among the work force and in the workplace was that of the director, instead you made a motion to give him even more power.    Mr. Carter. You would assume.
