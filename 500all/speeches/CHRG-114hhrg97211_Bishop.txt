    Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    And thank you to those of you who are here today to testify. Very interesting.    I'm from the great State of Michigan where we are known for our skilled workers. And over the years we've kind of moved away from that in Michigan and we're trying to do whatever we can to ramp up our vocational environments again.    And I'm wondering, I was just noticing, Dr. Huftalin, the Utah Aerospace Pathways Program is a fascinating example of partnership between local educators and industries. And I'm wondering if you can share with us how that internship program enhances the students' experience.    And also in that same regard, what advice can you give to other learning environments, vocational learning environments, to continue updating their processes and continuing to align with changing needs to ensure they are properly preparing their students for the jobs that are available today?    I ask that question because as I work my way through my district, I note that there is an emphasis on vocational training, but I'm not sure that it's just there to say it's there rather than being dynamic and moving with the economy. We have 96,000 unfilled jobs in Michigan, manufacturing jobs primarily, and it's very important for Michigan, and we're really trying to get this right.    Mr. Bishop. Very nice. Thank you very much.    And I'd kind of like to, Mr. Johnson, continue with the conversation you were having with Mr. Carter. You were emphasizing the importance of partnering with practitioners. And I agree with that. And I'm wondering if you could--you were starting to talk about it, and I want to make sure that you had time to speak about it and talk about the importance and why you think it's important to partner with practitioners.    Mr. Bishop. Thank you very much for that.    And I yield back.
