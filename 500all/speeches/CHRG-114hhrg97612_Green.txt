    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I would like to talk about the effectiveness of DOE's oversight across various sites of the nuclear security complex and the reliability of related contractor assurance programs. Is it safe to say that the WIPP accident investigations prove that the Federal oversight and the contractor assurance systems were ineffective at WIPP and at LANL? The Y-12 security breach also demonstrated the ineffectiveness of oversight and contractor assurance.    For both our DOE witnesses, what do you know about the contractor assurance systems at the other nuclear weapons research facilities and cleanup sites? Are there any that you can point to that we can rightly say are effective for DOE oversight purposes?    Mr. Green. All of us would hope this would be an exception of the rule. So you are evaluating that now with your other sites to see if there has been any followup. I understand the GAO report, that NAP-21 established a process for NNSA headquarters to review the effectiveness of contractors' implementation of assurance systems and field offices' oversight approaches called affirmation. However, after the Y-12 security breach occurred at a facility whose contractor assurance system had been affirmed as effective, NNSA discontinued the process of affirmation reviews. Is that true?    Mr. Green. If you don't like the answer, you don't review it?    Mr. Green. OK. GAO has also recommended that NNSA establish a process of reviewing the effectiveness of field offices' oversight approaches, including the use of contractor assurance information. NNSA's response letter to the GAO report states that the new corporate policy and guidance will outline an approach for validating the effectiveness of the oversight approaches by March of 2016.    Administrator, does this mean that just the process will be established by March of 2016, not that the actual reviews will be conducted?    Mr. Green. OK. So how long after that will it take to conduct and complete the actual effectiveness reviews?    Mr. Green. So you are actually looking at a range of facilities to make sure these effectiveness reviews are conducted hopefully as soon as possible.    Mr. Green. And will that be before March 16?    Mr. Green. And this is systematic, I guess, of all the sites?    Mr. Green. OK. On EM's effectiveness.    Mr. Green. So in your testimony, it is a systemic and not just an exception. But you are working to fix it, I hope.    Mr. Green. OK.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know I am out of time.
