    Ms. Brownley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Ms. Halliday, for your report this morning. According to table seven on page 30 of your report, the incoming Los Angeles Regional Office Director received a relocation incentive of $20,000. As I understand it, relocation incentives are only supposed to be paid in cases where qualified applicants cannot be found or the position is hard to fill. However, and your report states that 168 applicants, five of whom were considered best qualified, had applied for the Los Angeles position. So according to the VBA policy should a relocation incentive have been offered in this case?    Ms. Brownley. Thank you. And then one other question is when an SES employee is offered a reassignment, what are their rights to refuse that reassignment? And what is the process to discuss the reassignment with the VBA leadership?    Ms. Brownley. So there are, I mean, in some sense if that was that strategy or protocol is implemented then there are no rights of the employee to refuse a reassignment?    Ms. Brownley. Thank you. I yield back.    The Chairman. Is it safe to assume that one of the easiest ways to be fired at the VA is to refuse to move with a management directed move? You do not have to answer. Thank you.
