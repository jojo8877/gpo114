    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Madam Chair, welcome. In a very positive sign for our economy, new jobs are being created at a rate not seen since the 1990s, averaging nearly 250,000 new jobs every month in 2014. To what extent has monetary policy been responsible for this improvement in our economy--    Ms. Velazquez. --in the labor market?    Ms. Velazquez. On the other hand, Chair Yellen, the financial industry continues to complain that the new capital standards will negatively impact access to credit, especially for small businesses. However, banks are continuing to ease lending and expect robust growth in 2015. Is there any truth to that claim?    Ms. Velazquez. And that leads to my next question. You commented recently that rebounding housing prices have restored much of the housing wealth we lost during the recession with working families experiencing some of the largest gains. With the prospect of economically stimulating low interest rates coming to an end, does the Fed have other tools to help lower a middle-income family's built wealth for the long term?    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
