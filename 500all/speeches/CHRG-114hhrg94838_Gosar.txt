    Dr. Gosar. Thank you, Madam Chair.    Dr. Tierney, is CO2 a pollutant?    Dr. Gosar. No, no, I did not ask that. I asked you.    Dr. Gosar. I will come back to that.    Attorney General Fox, you love dirty water, don't you?    Dr. Gosar. You love dirty water out in Montana?    Dr. Gosar. I am from Arizona and we love dirty water. How about you, Attorney General Rutledge?    Dr. Gosar. Let me ask you a question. Did you ask EPA to clarify the waters of the U.S., Attorney General Rutledge?    Dr. Gosar. Are you aware of anything in your State asking the EPA for clarification on waters of the U.S.?    Dr. Gosar. How about you, Attorney General Fox?    Dr. Gosar. Out in Arizona, we have the same problem. We are trying to figure out who these people are asking for clarification other than some bureaucrats.    Dr. Tierney, I am coming back to that conversation about CO2. Would you consider it an essential gas?    Dr. Gosar. I said, is it an essential gas?    Dr. Gosar. Is it an essential gas for this planet?    Dr. Gosar. So you are aware of photosynthesis? I got it.    Dr. Gosar. Good old plants take CO2 and dirty water.    Dr. Gosar. I think that is negatable.    Attorney General Fox, are you aware there are four Supreme Court rulings defying the EPA for where they want to go with the waters of the U.S.?    Dr. Gosar. Are you also aware that Congress did not give them that authority as well?    Dr. Gosar. Are you aware of that, Attorney General Rutledge?    Dr. Gosar. Why would we continue to go down this path without going through Congress first? It defies me. Does it defy you?    Dr. Gosar. I sat in my office 1 day to look at the hearing over at Transportation and Infrastructure. Ms. McCarthy was very insistent that they were going to come up with this rulemaking by April.    I find it interesting that my colleague on the other side keeps saying that they are not here and they shouldn't be here because they are proposing rulemaking. That doesn't make any sense because defied by Congress and the Supreme Court from actually going there, true?    Dr. Gosar. Ms. Tierney, I am going to go back to science. I love science. By the way, I am a dentist. I also have some botany in my background, some water and immunology aspects as well.    What would you say if you actually found out that through the EPA and their Clean Air Act, that implications on the Navajo generating station actually defied the facts of law?    Dr. Gosar. What would you think, as a scientist, if the EPA and their Clean Air administration in Arizona called the Navajo generating station actually defied the rule of science? What would you say to that, being a science person?    Dr. Gosar. Oh, interesting. You still have outcomes and facts, right?    Dr. Gosar. If they predicated an example for a Clean Air Act based on particulates coming from a certain coal plant.    Dr. Gosar. Say northeast that had implications on the Grand Canyon, which it did not, and EPA actually admitted that, would you think it was fair that those types of rules would be inferred and forced upon Arizona for lack of factual basis?    Dr. Gosar. I think you are outcomes-based and you have an opinion as an individual. You are sitting in front of a committee giving your expertise. I think you are more than applicable to that. I hope you are not taking the Scott Walker application and avoiding the question.    Dr. Gosar. I am not a lawyer. I am also a dentist so that is why I am asking your personal opinion. Would you find it contradictive that we would use facts of science and find they are factually biased and factually false and still use those to predicate a rule?    Dr. Gosar. It is actually a true statement.    Dr. Gosar. Thank you, Madam Chair. I will yield back.    Dr. Gosar. Dr. Smith, I have a couple of questions for you. You did a Clean Power Plan evaluation for global temperature changes. What did you find?    Dr. Gosar. Was it within the margin of error?    Dr. Gosar. Point zero zero three.    Dr. Gosar. Statistically, is it an anomaly?    Dr. Gosar. Interesting.    Attorney General Fox, you are a geologist. Are you aware of any climate change in our years past?    Dr. Gosar. History tells us a lot of about that. My dad was a geologist. As soon as the sun came up, our car always slowed down and we were always talking about this period of time, right?    Dr. Gosar. Fossils are kind of a product of that, right?    Dr. Gosar. Coal is kind of a product of that, right?    Dr. Gosar. Gas is a product of that, right?    Dr. Gosar. And oil?    Dr. Gosar. Along those same lines, Attorney General Rutledge, what kind of implications can you have on civil penalties the EPA has already started to establish? I will rephrase that a little bit. Are you aware of civil penalties that can be expounded by civil violations of the clean waters of the U.S.?    Dr. Gosar. Some are pretty severe?    Dr. Gosar. I am aware of a poor rancher in Wyoming that has a $75,000 penalty on a stock pond that actually followed State regulations of Wyoming ADQ. Still, the EPA thinks they run the roost. Do you find that a violation of State sovereignty.    Dr. Gosar. Would you feel the same way, Attorney General Fox?    Dr. Gosar. Thank you.
