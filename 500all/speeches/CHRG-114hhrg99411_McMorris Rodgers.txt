    Mrs. McMorris Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to thank the committee for their work in advancing the cause of life, for Vice Chairman Blackburn's work introducing H.R. 3494, the Protecting Infants Born Alive Act, and for Congresswoman Ellmer's work on her legislation to prevent providers acting in contravention of the partial-birth abortion ban from getting tax dollars through Medicaid.    It has now been 2 months since the first undercover video surfaced, and the public concern has not subsided. These videos challenge all of us as legislators and as human beings to reflect and to work towards better protections for women, children, and families.    Today, the President promised that he would veto a bill that says babies that survive an abortion do not deserve life-saving care. It is unthinkable to me that we live in a country where we let living, breathing babies die simply because they were born during an abortive procedure. And the President doesn't want to just not let this happen, he is actively opposing efforts to save babies that were born alive.    This is a radical, extreme departure from what I know to be right. And I am grateful for this committee's work on this important issue and for my colleagues' important work here today.    And I would like to yield to the lady from North Carolina, Mrs. Ellmers.
