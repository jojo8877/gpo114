    Mr. Walker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    This is a lot of information to process. It is very studious work on your parts. I appreciate that.    I have two or three things I want to address. Mr. Nutkis, let me start with you.    I have a lot of family in the health care industry. More and more that is becoming technological. Concerns and challenges facing this industry when addressing cyber threats is that something that has come across the table as far as discussion?    I want to know what you are hearing on this and how you would address it? Is it a problem that you are hearing or facing in the medical community?    Mr. Walker. Correct, yes.    Mr. Walker. At some point, is this considered a life and death matter? Could someone hack a system where they increase the defibrillator or are we at that point to be concerned about that?    Mr. Walker. Mr. Bejtlich, earlier I believe you categorized different cyber attacks by the Chinese and Russians were for financial purposes. Can you go through that process again? I want to make sure I get that information because you said some of it was financial and some was more malicious intent. You make sure I have all that information correct?    Mr. Walker. In your opinion, if you are looking at lone wolf, guy on the mountain based criminal behavior versus some of the international threats, give me a concern overall in your community as far as what we are looking at? Where is the weightedness as far as immediate concern we are.    Mr. Walker. Do you have any numbers as far as how many attacks we might be trying fiend off on a daily basis?    Mr. Walker. Before my time expires, you mentioned three things earlier as far as working to prevent some of this, better credit cards. Can you address some of that? What do you mean by that?    Mr. Walker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
