    Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the hearing, and Ranking Member Green.    Mr. Chairman, let me ask you a couple of questions. Do you receive any direction from the White House?    Mr. Cleaver. Has the FDIC given any kind of direction to the Department of Justice to investigate financial institutions particularly selected by the FDIC or by you?    Mr. Cleaver. Was the high-risk list a plan to stop banks from doing business with those entities that were listed?    Mr. Cleaver. I appreciate that statement. And I had read your comments on that previous to this hearing.    What I am trying to get clarity on is: Was there some political motive, people moving through the shadows, meeting down in basements with no lights, plotting against businesses that they didn't like and then you and the AG press a button and say, go and get these bad guys and put them on a list of nasty companies?    Mr. Cleaver. No cigar-smoke-filled rooms with your staff and others in the basement of the White House--    Mr. Cleaver. --parked across the street?    Frankly, I am glad that you know the high-risk list. I am hoping that we can deal with this without there being some subliminal reason for this being done other than reasons that I think are fairly clear to us.    One of the roles of this committee is, of course, to try to find out what is going on. And it is our responsibility. So, tough questions are supposed to be asked.    My questions were not particularly tough questions, but they were aimed at trying to hopefully bring some clarity to this whole issue and its genesis.    So I just wanted to find out whether or not you have been secretly meeting with the President either on the basketball court, or on the south lawn of the White House.    Mr. Cleaver. How often do you meet with the President?    Mr. Cleaver. Did he slip you something to the side on a sheet of paper?    Mr. Cleaver. Okay. I have no other questions. Thank you.
