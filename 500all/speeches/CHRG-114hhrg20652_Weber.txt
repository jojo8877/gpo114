    Mr. Weber. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Envoy Wolosky, is that how you're saying that?    Mr. Weber. Okay. You said that the standard was not the elimination of risk but a mitigation of risk in your earlier comments. Was that true under the prior administration as well?    Mr. Weber. So you all came in--the current administration came in with that in 2009, basically?    Mr. Weber. So that was the standard that you used? That's pretty shocking what Congressman Duncan revealed, that we were told that Uruguay was not going to be able to monitor these guys' travel. There were six terrorists and I am not knowledgeable or privy to who they were. These were not the five that was released in exchange for Bergdahl. Is that correct?    Mr. Weber. Is it fair to say that in the Bush administration didn't they attempt to try to release what was assessed to be the lower level risk combatants at first?    Mr. Weber. Is it fair to say in the current administration, that you chose to release the lower risk first and held the worse to the last?    Mr. Weber. But common sense would probably dictate that the Bush administration followed those same guidelines?    Mr. Weber. That goes to the risk profile and I am sure, too. Now, the five that were exchanged for Bergdahl are they--any of those back on the battlefield?    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. All right. Well, his time has passed. I am going to move to the next question. So there are countries who take--who the administration negotiates with and we have a disagreement about whether or not they actually will monitor them or not.    What number of countries do we look at for transferring these combatants to? Is it 6, 8, 26? How many countries are involved?    Mr. Weber. Okay. So 30 countries. Are you monitoring? Are you able to track? You talked about--earlier in your comments you spoke with career government officials in making those assessments and those determinations. Career government officials on the United States side or on the prospective country side or both?    Mr. Weber. U.S. side. Okay. So of those 30 countries where we are sending people whether or not they can monitor them effectively or not and you said you're getting feedback--we called it--I think it was information sharing. Is that in real time?    Mr. Weber. It can be. But is it?    Mr. Weber. Was it in real time on the guy from Uruguay that got loose?    Mr. Weber. Okay. Okay. Of those 30 countries are you able to track in real time and even in retrospect are you able to track and say okay, this country did a good job of keeping up with their combatants, this country didn't, this country was okay, this country was lousy? Is there a scale of rating those countries and their abilities?    Mr. Weber. So how do you know going forward in the future? If a country doesn't do a good job, how do you say well, we'll give that country another one or two or three? How do you determine that?    Mr. Weber. Well, that would be a scale, wouldn't it?    Mr. Weber. Okay. Well, that makes sense. And then of the discussion you had with Mr. Duncan and Mr. Issa, you talked about the--those released under the previous administration, Bush, and there was 530, I think, released, and how many is under the current administration?    Mr. Weber. 159. So I don't think that you and Issa agreed on the fact that somehow Bush released the good ones and Obama released the bad ones. Is that a fair statement?    Mr. Weber. Okay. Would you say they were roughly equal?    Mr. Weber. Well, that----    Mr. Weber. Right. But it is safe to say without----    Mr. Weber. Well, without the specifics you can't accurately know that. But in general, a reasonable person might make that kind of assumption?    Mr. Weber. Okay. Fair enough.    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. Okay. Well, I am running out of time.    Mr. Weber. Let me--let me--we'll come back to that, Mr. Wolosky.    Mr. Weber. Mr. Wolosky, I am out of time.    Mr. Weber. Mr. Wolosky, I am out of time. Let me just say thank you for being forthright but we are on a time limit. I've got two quick questions.    Mr. Weber. Yes, sir. You may.    Mr. Weber. Can I make a suggestion?    Mr. Weber. Don't send them to Uruguay.    Mr. Weber. Mr. Wolosky, back to you.    Mr. Weber. You're welcome. At the end of the Uruguay program, you mentioned earlier that the guy got 3--2 months----    Mr. Weber. All right. Two months early. Tell, for the committee's sake, what would an additional 2 months have done, in your opinion? Would it have rehabilitated that combatant? What would that have done?    Mr. Weber. Should we have had snap back sanctions in place, to use another term bantered around?    Mr. Weber. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
