    Mr. Hurd. My first question is, how does the inability of deporting every person that violates our laws impact future illegal immigration?    Mr. Hurd. So how does a criminal alien actually get released, the process? They are in our custody, in U.S. Government custody, they get charged. What is that process?    Mr. Hurd. Sure.    Mr. Hurd. So do you think all criminal aliens should be deported?    Mr. Hurd. Okay.    Shifting a little bit to another topic, the surge of unaccompanied minors and families that we experienced last summer. Are you anticipating another surge this spring or summer? And what are you doing specifically? And I recognize that all elements of DHS are involved in that, and I am interested in hearing what ICE is doing to be prepared.    Mr. Hurd. On that area, you are saying Mexico is doing a good job of helping. What areas, what countries where we are seeing illegal immigration come from that are not being supportive or where there is room for growth?    Mr. Hurd. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
