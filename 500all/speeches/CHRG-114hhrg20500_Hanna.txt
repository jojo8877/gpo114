    Mr. Hanna. Thank you, Chairman.    Dr. Nield, you have heard the testimony, I know, and it is an interesting dynamic. A moratorium seems to be the antithesis of--and yet at the same time agree with Mr. MacCallum that if you need a moratorium, then you are not capable of doing the job. What would you wait for? And I am thinking of the Next Generation Aviation, which you are familiar with, which is 20 years behind now.    Mr. MacCallum, this industry, there are many different groups in it. It is a great opportunity, depending on who you are and what your level of risk you are able to take. But, I mean, is it possible to do everything everybody wants to do here successfully without having a great deal of latitude in the process? Because there are multiple ways of doing this and ideas. And we have seen that over the last 5 or 10 years.    Mr. Hanna. But we are not behind yet.    Mr. Hanna. Internationally, we are not behind yet. But ``yet'' being the operative word.    Mr. Hanna. It looks like a cheap excuse.    Mr. Hanna. What do you think, Dr. Nield? Can you manage all that?    Mr. Hanna. Mr. Gold.    Mr. Hanna. Does everyone agree with that?    Mr. Hanna. Thank you. I yield back.
