    Mr. DesJarlais. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Just a followup on a question that Mr. Walberg had asked. And whoever wants to take this question, feel free. How many new hire training classes do the Secret Service have funding for each year?    Mr. DesJarlais. OK. And is that what you did in the previous year? You did eight?    Mr. DesJarlais. OK. Thank you.    Your review found that in 2013, the Service changed its hiring process, and this resulted in more applicants but a less effective process at identifying strong candidates. In fact, more than half the applicants failed the routine polygraph that occurs during screening. Do you know who was responsible for this decision?    Mr. DesJarlais. OK. Any other downfalls at all that you didn't identify? OK. What does the Secret Service plan to do to fix the hiring process to better identify potential candidates?    Mr. DesJarlais. OK. You note that many of the recommendations in your report are not new. These recommendations go back to the 1964 Warren Commission, some are identified to the 1995 White House security review, and others track internal recommendations. What were those recommendations?    Mr. DesJarlais. Why do you think that a lot of those recommendations were ignored?    Mr. DesJarlais. So how will future Secret Service leaders be held accountable for implementing your recommendations?    Mr. DesJarlais. OK. And then the last question. Then how do you define that success or how should success be defined if you have implemented these recommendations properly?    Mr. DesJarlais. Thank you so much for your answers. I yield back.    Mr. DesJarlais. Thank you. I appreciate it.
