    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    While Congress and certainly this committee understand the need for this legislation, I do believe that it might not go far enough in providing the tools Puerto Rico needs to recover from their current fiscal crisis.    There are many good measures in the bill that will do a great deal to resolve the issue, but there are also other things that can be done--and some may have mentioned this already, but I wanted to go on record--such as putting the territories on the same footing as the states when it comes to the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit, and removing the caps on Medicaid.    Just quickly, anybody on the panel, can any of you explain to me why these proposals should not be part of this bill?    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you.    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you.    And, last, I notice that in the final draft, the name of the board has been changed from the Puerto Rico Oversight Board to the Territorial Oversight Board. That actually makes Americans far more nervous. While this may seem trivial, I am concerned with this renaming and its implications as well as some of the language in sections 303 and 401, which essentially gives Congress carte blanche power over the territories.    In your opinion, would the language contained in this bill grant Congress unlimited powers with regard to the other territories?    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
