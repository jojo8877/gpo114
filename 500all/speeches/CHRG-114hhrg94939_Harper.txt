    Mr. Harper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Stanislaus, in light of the fact that the final rule requires the cleanup level to be set at either the MCL or the background level, if a State chooses to incorporate risk-based decisionmaking into the coal ash permit programs that establish an alternative groundwater protection standard, would EPA be able to approve the State plan as being as stringent or more stringent than the final rule?    Mr. Harper. Let me just ask this: If a State determines that there is no human receptor for the groundwater and that a cleanup standard above the MCL or background is appropriate, would that meet the minimum requirements of the rule?    Mr. Harper. OK. If you will let us know.    Mr. Harper. I will just yield back.    Mr. Harper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I am going to yield my time to the gentleman from West Virginia, Mr. McKinley.
