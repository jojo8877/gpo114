    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, panel, for being here today. Very interesting and informative, and I appreciate the expertise that you bring to the table.    Mr. Purdy, let me begin with you. Can you describe for me a little bit about the program, the Mirror Image? I understand that it's something that allows law enforcement to walk in the shoes of terrorists or something to that effect. Could you describe that a little further, please?    Mr. Hice. So I take it then from your answer, that you believe this has been quite beneficial?    Mr. Hice. Very good. Let me transition over to you, Mr. Gartenstein-Ross. What do you think at the end of the day is actually attracting people to ISIS caliphate?    Mr. Hice. If you don't mind, let me interrupt. I've only got about a minute left, and just open up a question to each of you. Do any of you know what the objectives are of our current administration in terms of their national strategy for countering violent extremism?    So I take it from that that no one knows what our strategy is?    Mr. Hice. Promote tolerance, to extremism?    Mr. Hice. No. I'm just asking is that what you're saying?    Mr. Hice. All right. Well, Mr. Chairman, I see my time is expired. It's amazing to me that we virtually have no understanding of our own administration's strategy to deal with this, and what we do hear of what we believe is quite alarming. With that I yield back. Thank you.
