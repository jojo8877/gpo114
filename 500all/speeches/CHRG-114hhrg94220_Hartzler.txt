    Mrs. Hartzler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate the tough job that you have. Quickly, I appreciate all you are doing and have done for the B-2 Stealth Bomber. Certainly the modernization program and everything is very, very important. You mention in your testimony that you are going to continue to pursue a number of sustainment initiatives to improve aircraft supportability, increase aircraft availability. I know that is something that I have been visiting with you all about as part sustainability and how--can you expand on some of the things that you are doing there to try to ensure that we have the parts we need for the     Mrs. Hartzler. Just to follow up on the computer software program that I understand is being developed, be able to project the parts that would be needed to help them in advance be able to get in, do you have an update on that?    Mrs. Hartzler. Sure.    LT Gen Holmes . On that one.    Mrs. Hartzler. Thank you for all that you do. I yield back.
