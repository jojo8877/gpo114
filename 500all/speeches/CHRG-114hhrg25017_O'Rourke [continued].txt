    Mr. O'Rourke . --of very little time. My fault for taking too much time at the outset, but with the Chairman's indulgence. Could the VA instruct the director in El Paso don't hire any more podiatrists or endocrinologists, you have got them in the community, you can refer them, that is a condition comparable to what the civilian population has, PTSD is very unique to veterans, only hire your traumatic brain experts, your PTSD experts, your psychologists and psychiatrists?    I recognize your canary-in-a-coal-mine analogy that medicine in America is struggling with this and yet there is a way to resolve this with the current capacity, I know there is. I know there are psychiatrists and psychologists working in private practice who could be brought over to the VA with the right inducements, focus and leadership. Are we going to see that this year?
