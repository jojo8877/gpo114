    Ms. Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it. And I thank you to all the witnesses, and to Calan, who is asleep. Gosh, I have a puppy. If only Calan could give my puppy some advice.    Again, thank you. I am from Florida, and so you probably can guess what my question is going to be about. Our state has been devastated by citrus greening, which is an example of an infestation that has such a significant impact on the economy of Florida. And it is spreading now. I mean it is spreading, it is in Texas, it is in California. So I would appreciate an update on what we are doing to address this threat, from Mr. Shea or anyone else who would like to speak to the question.    Ms. Graham. I really appreciate that because Florida is known for its citrus industry, and we need to be doing whatever we can to provide a remedy.    And I am interested in California. You found the psyllid in private trees but not in the commercial trees. And if that is the case, how are you preventing it from transferring to the commercial groves?    Ms. Graham. Well, thank you. I am from north Florida, which is not typically known as where the orange groves and the citrus groves are, but we are getting involved in the citrus industry, because if you are growing in a greenhouse, you can prevent the psyllid from entry. So I want to thank you, and I look forward to continuing to work with the USDA to eradicate the psyllid and do whatever we can for the citrus industry. It is so important to Florida, it is so important to our country. So thank you very much.    I am out of time. I yield back the time I don't have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
