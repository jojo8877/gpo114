    Mr. DAVIDSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here. I have a couple basic questions on metrics.    So how, Mr. Shoraka, how do you measure the success of the program?    Mr. DAVIDSON. So participation, I mean, simply participating in the program's success, what are the economic benefits of the program? I mean, clearly there are benefits to the firm that get the contracts, but are there costs to the firm? I mean, they are basically getting a 10 percent cost preference in contracting, so does that really result in the government paying 10 percent more for the things they buy from that 3 percent of firms? Or is there a cost or savings? Have you measured that?    Mr. DAVIDSON. Thanks for that. And then how much does the HUBZone program cost to administer? Do you allocate cost in your budget in terms of what it costs?    Mr. DAVIDSON. And how many people are employed doing that?    Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Shear, would you agree with those conclusions on metrics?    Mr. DAVIDSON. Setting aside Puerto Rico, do you have a mandate to do this anywhere, Mr. Shoraka, to actually create--because here is the concern, right? I disagree. Not every community would want to be a HUBZone. They want a good economy. They want good jobs and they want the opportunities that, by definition, make you not qualified as a HUBZone. So it is success to not be a HUBZone, frankly. But we are spending money because we want fewer HUBZones. You have found a way to increase more HUBZones or more places which flies in the eyes. So if we are spending the money, what are we getting in return? That is the thing that I think the American people want to know. And certainly, in our district where we do not have HUBZones, we want to know, hey, what are we getting? We are donating this for a good cause, right?    Mr. DAVIDSON. Thank you. My time is expired. Thank you.
