    Dr. Chilton. Again, thank you for the opportunity to testify about the National Commission on Hunger. As a scientist at the Dornsife School of Public Health at Drexel University in Philadelphia, I bring over 15 years of experience designing and carrying out research studies among families with young children to investigate the causes, consequences, and prevention of hunger. I have directly witnessed the physical, social, emotional, and spiritual pain that hunger causes.    Our field hearings for the National Commission also helped us to learn about the realities of hunger. The experience of one particular person, Saleema Akbar, who lives right here in Washington, D.C., made that hardship of hunger quite clear, and these are her words. ``I have worked since I was 13 years old. I am not a senior yet. I am only 57. I have fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and diabetes. With the diabetes, they tell me that I have to eat a lot of protein. I get food stamps, but I don't have enough money to buy enough protein to make it through the rest of the month. I am not a child, so I can't get help from any programs, and I am not yet a senior, so I can't get those, so I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. My disability income goes to pay my rent. I get disability because I am 100 percent disabled.'' She said, ``When you are talking about hunger, it is right here, right here. I know you have to feed the babies. I know you have to feed the seniors. But what about the people in the middle?''    Ms. Akbar's testimony reveals to us two things. Number one, like her, the vast majority of people who experience hunger are already vulnerable. They are made vulnerable by their physical and mental health, or perhaps by historical and social circumstances, or perhaps they are incapable of coping with the stress of poverty. Number two, while it is absolutely true that we have very effective nutrition programs, and other support for low-income families, there are still many people that are missed, discounted, or uncounted that are poorly served through our current program structures.    Hunger is an experience of poor nutrition that has major health consequences. Our research shows that hunger has serious consequences, especially in early childhood. Infants and toddlers that are younger than age 3 are in the most important years of human development, and any type of nutritional deprivation in those early years has lifelong consequences, and that is because hunger negatively affects children's physical, social, emotional, and cognitive functioning. These consequences stay with kids across their lifespan, and they can be transferred to the next generation. This type of childhood adversity is what neuroscientists call toxic stress. Other types of toxic stress are homelessness, exposure to violence, or having a parent in prison. Our report insists that families with young children are quite vulnerable to hunger, and they need special attention. Another group that needs our attention is America's veterans. Among veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, 12 percent reported hunger. This is twice the rate of hunger in the general population. Given the serious problems associated with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, we understand that in addition to having nutrition support, veterans may need specialized support to find jobs, and access to safe, affordable housing.    SNAP, WIC, and other nutrition programs do a good job of reducing hunger and promoting health, but they do not solve hunger completely. Clearly we need to improve our current programs, but we also need to address the root causes of hunger, and ensure that we are counting and supporting the most vulnerable citizens of America. Saleema Akbar experiences hunger right here in D.C., and she can no longer be discounted. So many people in communities across America need your attention and leadership. One of our recommendations, therefore, is quite simple. Congress, and the White House, must insist on more effective cross-agency collaboration. Beyond the Department of Agriculture, this includes the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, Department of Labor, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Veterans' Administration. In concert with leadership from the White House and Congress, these agencies should make a coordinated national plan to end hunger in America. Only with this type of leadership, driven by your sense of social, moral, and personal responsibility to our country, is ending hunger possible. Thank you.

This Commission was created by legislative mandate in the Omnibus Appropriations Bill of 2014, with the following charge:          To provide policy recommendations to Congress and the USDA         Secretary to more effectively use existing programs and funds         of the Department of Agriculture to combat domestic hunger and         food insecurity; and to develop innovative recommendations to         encourage public-private partnerships, faith-based sector         engagement, and community initiatives to reduce the need for         government nutrition assistance programs, while protecting the         safety net for the most vulnerable members of society.    Congressional leaders from both parties appointed ten members to the Commission: three each by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader (John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Harry Reid, D-Nevada, respectively, at that time); and two each by the House and Senate Minority Leaders (Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, respectively, at that time). The Commission members represent government, industry, academia, and nonprofit organizations. The biographies of each Commission member are included in the Appendix.    At the outset of our work together, the Commission selected two of our members as co-chairs to guide our work: Mr. Robert Doar and Dr. Mariana Chilton.    Between the two of us, we have over 35 years of experience in addressing poverty and hunger. Robert Doar spent nearly 2 decades administering many of our nation's major safety net programs in New York City and New York State, and Dr. Mariana Chilton has dedicated much of her academic career to studying hunger, its causes, and its consequences for low-income Americans. We have been honored to serve as co-chairs of this bipartisan Commission.    The Commission's goal is to develop recommendations to Congress and the USDA that has the unanimous, bipartisan support of all our members. We are close to completing our report, and are honored to share our process with you.    Over the last year and a half, we traveled to nine cities and heard testimony from 80 invited experts and 102 members of the public who provided testimony and advice during hearings, briefings and site visits. We also observed government and nonprofit programs designed to alleviate hunger. We talked with struggling Americans trying to ensure a better life for themselves and their children. We listened to state officials describe the challenges they face in serving their populations. Through this process, we gained insight into the root causes of hunger in America, why it is such a significant problem, and what improvements can be made.    As is to be expected from bipartisan commissions, sometimes we saw the same things and reached different conclusions about solutions. However, we are working together to put forward a report that gains the unanimous endorsement from our members and presents a full picture of hunger in America. We are confident that consensus will soon be reached and hopeful that upon its release, the report will be considered carefully by Congress.    Today, we will give an update on our findings and the themes at the center of our forthcoming report. We lead with our outline:  I.  Our definition of hunger and its consequences.  II.  The root causes of hunger.  III.  The populations that warrant specific concern.  IV.  Our priorities in recommending solutions and improvements.I. Our Definition of Hunger and its Consequences    Before we could reach any conclusions about hunger in America, we first had to agree about how to define and quantify it. We chose a measure of hunger called ``very low food security,'' defined as the disruption of eating patterns and reduced food intake for at least one household member because the household lacked money or other resources for food. As a Commission, we are in agreement that hunger is an important problem. We also want to be clear that the hunger seen in America is not the equivalent of the famine and severe malnutrition found in developing countries. In our judgment, the very low food security measure of hunger appropriately reflects the reality of serious hardship and focuses our attention on the U.S. households where the problem is most severe. By this measure, 5.6 percent of households (6.9 million households) reported hunger in 2014.\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \1\ Coleman-Jensen A., Rabbitt M., Gregory C., Singh A.

When children experience hunger, their academic performance suffers.\2\ Adolescents in families reporting hunger encounter more problems with mental health and thoughts of suicide.\3\ Adults that report hunger are more likely to be overweight and have other health problems.\4\ For seniors, hunger can lead to depression and reduced capacity to perform day-to-day tasks.\5\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \2\ Hickson M., de Cuba S.E., Weiss I., Donofrio G., Cook J.

And given these concrete consequences, we argue that reducing hunger should be an urgent priority of Congress.II. The Root Causes of Hunger    After hearing over 180 testimonies and visiting multiple cities, it is clear to the Commission that there are many factors leading to hunger in America. A simple explanation focused only on low household income or insufficient nutrition assistance ignores other critical causes. For example, underemployment and unemployment are major factors. Underemployment, which includes part time jobs with unpredictable and fluctuating amounts of hours, seasonal work, or very low wages, causes major income instability or sharp income fluctuations, which are associated with increased odds of hunger. Additionally, households without a working adult are disproportionately likely to experience hunger.\6\ The 2007-2009 economic downturn led to a more than doubling of unemployed workers, and hunger levels spiked correspondingly.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \6\ Coleman-Jensen A. Working for peanuts: nonstandard work and food insecurity across household structure. Journal of Family and Economic Issues. 2011; 32: 84-97.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Six years after the official end of the recession, hunger rates today remain at historically high levels. And the negative impact of labor market forces on hunger is not just cyclical. Due to globalization and automation, our economy has experienced structural shifts over the last 60 years that have led to fewer well-paying job opportunities for Americans without a college degree.\7\ Adverse labor market conditions weaken the best defense against hunger: adequate earnings from employment.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \7\ Acemoglu D., Autor D., Dorn D., Hanson G.H., Price B. Import competition and the great U.S. employment sag of the 2000s. August 2014. Available at http://economics.mit.edu/files/9811.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Relatedly, we identified a strong relationship between hunger and education that works in both directions. Children experiencing hunger have lower graduation rates, while individuals without a high school degree are more likely to experience hunger than their peers who completed high school.<SUP>8-9</SUP>---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \8\ Alaimo K., Olsen C., Frongillo J.

Available at http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/1120651/eib-113.pdf.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    A third critical factor is family structure. Marriage has a significant impact on whether or not a household will experience hunger: The hunger rate for households headed by married couples is 3.2%, yet for households headed by a single mother with children, the rate is four times that at 12.8%. For households headed by single fathers, the rate is more than two times that of married couples at 7%.\10\ Furthermore, children who grow up in single parent families are less likely to do well in school or graduate high school.\11\ The fact that 40% of children in the United States are now born to parents that are not married is a key explanation for the continued existence of hunger.\12\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \10\ Coleman-Jensen A., Rabbitt M., Gregory C., Singh A. Household food security in the United States in 2014. Washington, D.C.: Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture; September 2015.

New York, NY: Broadway Books; 2000.    \12\ The vast majority of pregnancies among couples that are not married are unplanned.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    We also agreed that a full understanding of hunger requires acknowledging the fact that the historical legacies of racism in America and continued racial discrimination today affect access to jobs, home ownership, education, and affordable healthy food. The persistence of racial inequality contributes to hunger rates of 10.4% and 6.9% for African American and Hispanic households, respectively, compared to a 4.5% rate for white households.\13\ Additionally, there is a clear link in the research between exposure to violence and hunger.\14\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \13\ Coleman-Jensen A., Rabbitt M., Gregory C., Singh A. Household food security in the United States in 2014. Washington, D.C.: Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture; September 2015.

Very low food security in the USA is linked with exposure to violence. Public Health Nutr. 2014; 17(1): 73-82.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Finally, it is critical to acknowledge one other key ingredient--the actions of individuals. We agree as a Commission that personal agency, responsibility, and the importance of individuals making good choices play a role in the extent to which Americans are hungry, and any discussion of hunger that ignores the importance of personal responsibility is incomplete.III. Populations of Specific Concern    In our study of this issue, we have discovered that certain groups in our country are particularly at risk of experiencing hunger. For instance, the number of seniors will increase dramatically over the next few decades, and it seems likely that the number of homebound seniors will increase correspondingly. Because this growth will further strain organizations on which many elderly Americans depend, such as Meals on Wheels, seniors will be a group that warrants attention. People with disabilities are also a population of specific concern as 38% of all households experiencing hunger include an adult with a disability.\15\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \15\ Coleman-Jensen A., Nord M.

Available at http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/980690/err_144.pdf.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    A third population we want to focus on is America's veterans and active duty military. A 2012 study of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars found that 12% reported hunger, and approximately 1-2% of active duty military members receive SNAP benefits.\16\ While there is little data on the extent of hunger among active duty military and veterans, we agree that this issue deserves careful research and consideration.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \16\ Windome R., Jensen A., Bangerter A. Food insecurity among veterans of the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Public Health Nutr. 2015; 18(5): 844-848; and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service.

Available at http://mldc.whs.mil/public/docs/report/qol/SNAP_and_Military_Quick_Facts_Feb_2014_update_w_2010-2012_ACS.pdf.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Our Commission is also particularly worried about the formerly incarcerated, who have difficulty finding jobs, adequate housing and opportunities to re-engage with their families and communities. As previously indicated, single parent families with young children are especially vulnerable to experiences of hunger. And immigrants and American Indians face particular challenges in gaining access to enough healthy food.    As Congress considers what interventions should be used to reduce hunger, we recommend that these seven groups--seniors, single parent families, people with disabilities, veterans and active duty military, American Indians, immigrants, and the formerly incarcerated--be given special consideration.IV. Priorities in Recommending Solutions and Improvements    In our field visits and hearings, we saw and heard about public and private food programs that were effective in reducing hunger. We encountered research showing that the Federal Government's food assistance programs--SNAP, WIC, and school meals among others--are essential tools that effectively target those in need.\17\ However, the latest ERS statistics show that hunger remains elevated despite a 171 percent increase in SNAP receipt since 2000. This illustrates clearly that food assistance programs are addressing the problem, but not fully solving the problem, and this Commission believes that, without a focus on root causes and emphasis on work and nutrition, we will continue to fail to end hunger. Our vital safety net programs provide a strong foundation on which to build a more effective approach to fighting hunger.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \17\ Shafir E.

The primary goal of SNAP is to treat and prevent hunger, but it can also serve as a support for families as they enter the job market. We will put forward recommendations designed to help benefit recipients find work, improve work incentives in assistance programs, and encourage policymakers to evaluate the states' performance in helping employable recipients go to work so they can earn sufficient wages.    We also believe that nutrition programs should be viewed as an opportunity to ensure healthy choices among recipients, and we will endorse evidence-based strategies to encourage good nutrition, promote health, and help recipients make positive choices for their families.    Our Commission will also prioritize finding ways to directly improve the immediate well-being of vulnerable Americans. Our recommendations will involve increasing access to and coordination of essential safety nets, improving the support offered to military families, and encouraging civic engagement efforts to provide help to our neighbors in our own communities.    We don't pretend to have all of the answers to the problem of hunger in America. Instead, we want policymakers at the Federal, state, and local level to experiment with new ideas and to advance changes that prove to be successful. We plan to recommend several pilot programs and to encourage rigorous testing and evaluation of these experiments.    Finally, while Congress can move forward on many of our recommendations, addressing the root causes of hunger, and ensuring that we protect the most vulnerable citizens of America will also take very deliberate, cross-sector and cross-agency collaboration that is encouraged by Congress and led by the Executive Branch. This will ensure that the relevant agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, the Department of Agriculture, and the Veterans Administration (to name only a few) coalesce around the common cause of ending hunger in America. This type of leadership, collaboration, and commitment will demonstrate to all Americans that ending hunger is an achievable goal.    Thank you again for the opportunity to provide you with an overview of our work. We hope that our findings and recommendations prove useful in your efforts to help America become a stronger and healthier nation.

The chair would remind Members that they will be recognized for questioning in order of seniority for Members who were here at the start of the hearing. After that, Members will be recognized in order of arrival. I appreciate Member's understanding. I recognize myself for 5 minutes.    Again, I thank the witnesses for being here. We scheduled this hearing in anticipation that the final report would be done in October, and so that is why we are a little bit out of sync, but I wanted to go ahead and bring the Co-Chairs in with us this morning to visit.    Today is our tenth hearing on SNAP, which actually is more than the last three Congresses combined, and calls attention to an issue that is of great concern to all of us. We have made a conscious effort to proceed without preconceived notions, and with a desire to hear from a range of perspectives. We have heard from policy experts, advocates, practitioners, agency officials, and, most importantly, current and former SNAP recipients, and it appears that the Commission made a similar effort to cover a range of perspectives, and to open this process to public witnesses. You are both well versed in the topic of hunger, as are the other Commission members, and you could easily have met and brought your ideas to form your recommendations. Instead, you took a considerable effort to go beyond your own knowledge base, which is important to do. So, with that backdrop, what additional perspectives did you pull in that we might not have been addressing here so far?    Dr. Chilton. It certainly wasn't a surprise to hear that----    The Chairman. Please talk into your microphone.    Dr. Chilton. Thank you. It certainly wasn't a surprise to hear, across the country, from most of the people who are recipients of SNAP and the other programs, that their primary concern is finding access to well-paying jobs. When we were in New Mexico, and in Maine, and in Texas, we heard a lot about how the economy was still struggling, high unemployment rates and it is still, very difficult to find full time employment so that they could get off of SNAP. There was a strong desire to be off of the nutrition programs, and the other programs, but there was also a strong appreciation for how those programs were helping families to get through the day.    I think some of the surprises were, I brought it up in my testimony, the rates of hunger among veterans. And we heard a little bit about active duty military, which were things that were very concerning to us, which we are hoping to investigate a little bit more. We were also hearing, especially in Washington, D.C., about the relationship between disability and food insecurity or hunger, and that was made to us very clear, especially by Saleema Akbar and several others in Washington, D.C. We heard many other things, but those were the things that surprised me. Certainly the veterans, we need more assistance from the Department of Defense and the Veterans' Administration.    The Chairman. You mentioned Ms. Akbar. Were there other memorable witnesses that stand out, besides her experience that you can share with us?    Dr. Chilton. In Maine there was someone who testified who has been a recipient of SNAP, and who has also been in and out of the workforce, and was also very appreciative of the summer feeding programs, but one of the comments that she made is that we spend so much time and effort figuring out how to coordinate summer feeding, or how to help people to not experience hunger, but that we aren't doing enough to address the underlying issues that are related to poverty. She wants more access to skills, more training, more opportunities to get out of poverty. And what was upsetting, and sad to hear, but also very revealing, was that the access to emergency food, and to other food programs, is good, but all that really does in the end is keep her in line, waiting for the box of food.    Dr. Chilton. Thank you very much for your question. As a Member of Congress, you might be better poised to answer the question about why there is interest in cutting the programs. From my perspective as a scientist, my sense is that many legislators, and just the general public, do not understand what the experience of hunger is like. They may have this notion that hunger is a type of an eyeball diagnosis, that somehow we can see it on a person's face, or see it very easily. But hunger manifests in very invisible ways, but very harmful ways. It manifests in poor mental health, poor physical health, inability to get along with your peers, especially for children. For adolescents who are experiencing food insecurity, it is related to thinking about suicide. So it is hard to see it, and there is a lack of understanding about what the true issues really are.    Mr. David Scott of Georgia. Dr. Chilton, and you too, if you have something----    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia.--that they would have that they took home. Another issue that I see, quite honestly, is abuse at the retail level, where many poor people in this country end up paying significantly more for a gallon of milk than my wife and I pay for it when we go to the local grocery store and shop. I don't know that we can mandate fixes to all of those things, but I do know that the only way out of poverty is a job, and work. And the easier it is to create a job in this country, the easier it is to own a business in this country, the easier it is going to be for people to find that work to hopefully work their way out of poverty. And the goal would be to get them to the point where they no longer needed to be on the program.    So one of my key questions--you do a nice job highlighting the positive effects of work. I think that is a bipartisan effort in the Commission.    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Do you think that the current structure of the SNAP program discourages work?    Dr. Chilton. I will start in on that. I am not really sure I would use the word discourage, but there is an issue that our Commission has really investigated, and that is it turns out that very low food security is often reported by people who are earning a little bit more than some people, and if they lose their SNAP benefits because they find a better job, they may have gotten a raise because they are doing well in the workforce, it is possible that they are losing their food stamps too soon, before they are able to adjust to the new income.    And we have research with the Children's HealthWatch study, I am a member of that study. I know my colleague, Dr. Eddie Ochoa, was here a few weeks ago. It is a part of our research that shows that when families earn a little bit more, and then lose their food stamps, that they are more likely to report child hunger, which is the most severe form of food insecurity. It is a little bit counterintuitive, so something is going on there in the SNAP program where our Commission thinks that we could do a better job incentivizing people into the workforce. And a part of that may be lengthening the amount of time that we give families to stabilize themselves so that the income fluctuations don't push a person off of the SNAP benefits, and it makes them hungrier than they were before.    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. In other words, if I make $1 too much to qualify, I could lose hundreds of dollars worth of----    Dr. Chilton. Yes. In a manner of speaking, yes.    Dr. Chilton. Seven. We were in Albany, New York, Oakland, California. We had a roundtable discussion in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and had a site visit in New Mexico. We were in Little Rock, Arkansas, El Paso, Texas, Portland, Maine----    Dr. Chilton.--Washington, D.C.    Mr. LaMalfa.--similar type hearings, with many witnesses, or did----    Dr. Chilton. Yes. We started out with about eight to ten invited witnesses, and then we opened it up for at least 2 hours for public testimony, where anyone could sign up, and we had a variety of people. We had about 80 invited testimonies, and 100 uninvited, or just public testimonies.    Dr. Chilton. Not only was it brought up in our testimonies, but we also were reviewing the research. It is about 20 years of food insecurity research that we were investigating, and also talking to administrators about the experience of trying to administrate staff, and helping people to find jobs. And so it was not just in the testimonies that we heard it, but we also see it in the research.    Dr. Chilton. Certainly.    Mr. McGovern.--on whether we should have a White House conference so we can get the White House listening----    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Mr. McGovern.--they will actually do something?    Dr. Chilton. I will----    Dr. Chilton. I will get to that in a second.    Dr. Chilton. Talking about flexibility first, actually, in the employment and training programs, it turns out that, in the states that are trying to administer those, and trying to enhance those that the instructions are actually very confusing, and it is very difficult for them to figure out how to tap into subsidized employment. Also, we have heard from state administrators that when families are on this, and when a person isn't in an employment training program, and they get a job, that they lose their SNAP benefits too quickly, they are off the program. That also needs to be something that we look at.    So there are some very positive ideas related to flexibility that we could explore. One thing that is very concerning, that we heard in New Mexico, however, is that the Governor of New Mexico is now trying to institute a work requirement, a work participating type of requirement, for 16 and 17 year old children to participate in unpaid work. This is very concerning. It actually may not be allowable by Federal Law. So there are some times when states may take things into their own hands, and make matters worse.    On the issue of Executive leadership, we will make very precise recommendations, as precise as we can make them, as a non-Congressional type of a Commission. We are going to pitch it all to you, and we hope that you can put it in statute to make sure that the Executive Branch is actually taking some leadership, and incentivize the cross-agency collaboration. It has to be incentivized, and we have to actually think beyond a conference. It needs to be ongoing leadership at the highest levels of the White House.    Dr. Chilton. Pine Bluff.    Mr. Doar.--Pine Bluff, Arkansas. So we got a sense of that. Arkansas also has very high food insecurity rates. I think the highest in the country.    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Dr. Chilton. What we did learn about in Pine Bluff in Arkansas is that there is a major struggle. And in Pine Bluff especially, their primary concern, again, was jobs, well-paying jobs that had good safety measures for occupational hazards. The major employers in that area, the fastest growing employment opportunity is the Department of Corrections. That was very concerning to us, and also very concerning to the people in that area, who are losing their youth who are moving to the city, looking for jobs, because there is nothing else happening there. There are very high rates of hunger, and Arkansas itself had the biggest increase in the previous years.    We should have gone to Mississippi. We had very little time. It was a little bit difficult to get the money for us to travel. But we do hope that you, sir, could potentially make something happen to create an official visit to your state so that you could really investigate, and hear from people who are struggling, and then bring that back to Congress.    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Dr. Chilton. Sir, I am sorry, we don't have that specific data, and one of our recommendations that we will be making is that we need to do a better job of measuring food insecurity and SNAP participation among our veterans and active duty military. Right now it is very difficult for us to get that information. It is not readily available. It is not formally collected, and we think that should be collected. And what will help us--this is the idea of being uncounted or discounted. We need to make sure that we are counting those families that are being missed by our samples nationally. And we can't do anything about it, we think, if you can't measure it and see some kind of a movement on it, try to find a way to intervene.    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Mr. Kelly.--so I know that they can't afford to feed their families sometimes on what they are paid.    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Dr. Chilton. First of all, we reviewed the research that the staff created for us for the Research Triangle Institute, RTI. We looked at the populations that were the most vulnerable, and then we looked at the states that had the rates of very low food security, in other words hunger, and where there were major increases. Because of the limited amount of funds that were allotted to our Commission, and the limited amount of time, we worked through our networks to figure out where we could go in a way that would be low cost. So it was primarily through our own networks, and through navigating where the highest rates of hunger were that allowed us to get to Arkansas, Texas, New Mexico, et cetera. We also worked very closely with the Southwest Regional Office at the United States Department of Agriculture, and we collaborated with the USDA throughout to try to help us with these hearings.    Dr. Chilton. Well, one last thing. In El Paso we also had on site interpretation, live interpretation from English to Spanish, Spanish to English, and that was available to everyone as well----    Dr. Chilton. That was the only venue, unfortunately.    Dr. Chilton. Thank you very much for the beautiful, and extremely important question. Unfortunately, we have seen the racial and ethnic inequities in food insecurity since we have been measuring food insecurity in this country, and there has been no change in those disparities. That is very problematic, and I actually don't think that if we continue to administer SNAP in the current way that we do that we will be able to have an influence on reducing those racial and ethnic disparities.    Currently most of the agencies from the United States actually have an Office of Minority Health, have a particular incentive to reduce disparities. I don't think that, within the United States Department of Agriculture, there is any type of leadership on reducing disparities. There is no major office that is looking at it. And, indeed, it turns out that with American Indians, who have some of the highest rates of hunger, the USDA does fund some very excellent programs, that we heard some very positive things about, but the tribes are continuously complaining that they don't have access to tribal foods. The USDA is asking for studies on American Indian hunger, but it doesn't feel as if they are doing enough to try to reach out to American Indian communities to make sure that they can reduce those rates.    We need a more coordinated effort within the USDA, and, of course, across the agencies, more Executive leadership. The people who are coming out of prison have extremely high rates of food insecurity and hunger. I don't want to get into a conversation about mass incarceration, but I do think that, as we change the prison systems in the United States, that will actually help us to reduce food insecurity and hunger, and reduce some of the disparities. But we need a more comprehensive look, and more leadership at the top.    Dr. Chilton. That is our story, and we are sticking to it.    Dr. Chilton. Thank you so much for the question. It is actually very difficult to drill down, in any kind of meaningful way, for Asian populations, and Asian is a very, very broad category. There are a number of studies that look at people who are immigrants, but those studies are very small studies, and very localized, so in certain areas of the country we can pick up immigrants from Vietnam, et cetera. We can pick, for instance, with Children's HealthWatch, we are picking up the Somali population in Minneapolis, because that is where they are tending the refugees----    Dr. Chilton. Thank you.    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Ashford, 5 minutes.    Dr. Chilton. We have not had a comprehensive view that involves multiple agencies----    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Dr. Chilton. Yes. I think we use those words exactly.    Thank you.    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Dr. Chilton. Thank you very much for the question. We did look at food deserts, but I don't think we looked at it thoroughly enough. We heard a lot about lack of access to nutritious food, especially in the State of New Mexico, where the distances to the grocery store are very, very far. But, again, turning back to the concerns of the people that we heard from, the number one concern was being able to have enough money to purchase food, enough money for travel. So we don't make any recommendations in our report about food deserts. We do acknowledge that it is a really important issue. It is something that should be addressed. But the research on the relationship between food deserts and food insecurity is not very comprehensive, so we didn't feel confident enough to be able to make recommendations on----    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Ms. Plaskett.--where it is sheer distance. Did you look at urban areas that are food deserts because people do not have adequate transportation to not just purchase from the corner store, that doesn't have fresh fruit and vegetables?    Dr. Chilton. We did not look at that thoroughly, no, we did not.    Dr. Chilton. We were talking among the Commission, we were talking about extending the amount of shelf space for fruits and vegetables and healthier foods at SNAP eligible stores, that the USDA could make modifications to demand more of the corner stores, and demand more of the bodegas to have----    Dr. Chilton. Thank you very much for the question. We did not investigate in the territories what was happening. We did get some encouragement to look into it, and, again, we did the best that we could with the timeframe, and the amount of funds that we did have, but we do encourage Congress to maybe make a more comprehensive effort to look at what is happening in the territories, and make a coordinated plan for that.    Dr. Chilton. Okay. So overall the hunger rates for African American families are two to three times that of White families, and for Latino families the same is true. There is----    Dr. Chilton. I just----    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    Ms. Plaskett.--people just don't want to have a job?    Dr. Chilton. This is true.    Dr. Chilton. I do. We very deliberately chose the measure of very low food security at the household level, which we are referring to as hunger, which is an indication of reduced nutrient intake, and also disordered eating patterns, skipping meals, not eating for a whole day, and sometimes reporting hunger because families don't have enough money for food. This is a readily available measure that does indicate serious nutrition hardship in our country, and so we wanted to work with a measure that actually already exists, it is mandated through the United States Department of Agriculture and the Economic Research Service. So we feel like that is a very good measure to be working with. It is also a very broad measure. It picks up other kinds of issues about anxiety about having enough money for food, and it picks up the issue about having enough income for food, which is very, very important to the underlying issues of food insecurity.    Dr. Chilton. What we--if--can I add here?    Dr. Chilton. What we do think is really important is that states make more of an effort to help people find employment and training opportunities. As we heard in New Mexico, and in Maine, both of those states are now doing work requirements, and we heard in the testimonies that there is a lot of difficulty in finding jobs, getting transportation to those jobs, and getting access to child care. So as a Commission we did work very hard to find out ways that we could help states, or encourage, or potentially require states to offer assistance in helping families to find jobs with sustainable, good wages, and to be able to have the support that they need. Again, that could be child care, transportation, et cetera.    So with the waivers now expiring, this is very concerning, and we really hope that you can send a strong message to the states to make sure that there are good supports in place to help those families find gainful employment.    Dr. Chilton. Although we do know, through our research, and through the research of the United States Department of Agriculture, that when families do lose their SNAP benefits, and lose them too soon, they are more likely to report food insecurity, or very low food security. So it is a concern that families might be losing their--especially will be losing their SNAP benefits. Again, if there are the proper supports in place to help those individuals find and be able to keep jobs, then we can prevent any type of potential increase in hunger. It is a serious concern, and the issue about waivers is something that is very important. And again, as you know, we did not necessarily agree on that issue, and so we weren't able to pick it up. But there are 27 states that have voluntary employment and training programs, and they also need some support in helping to help people find good available employment, and opportunities for volunteering.    Dr. Chilton. Robert?    Dr. Chilton. How do you want to handle that one? I will go first. Thank you very much for your comments, and also for mentioning public health. We--in the world of public health, we see public health in all policies. So even though some people may think that food stamps, or SNAP, is a nutrition policy, it is actually a public health policy----    Dr. Chilton. In addition, the research bears out that families that have jobs that have unpredictable work hours, or that are seasonal workers, have major income fluctuations, and those income fluctuations are not necessarily accommodated in the SNAP program, so people may lose their SNAP benefits before they have stabilized their income, and are more likely to report hunger. So we are very interested in trying to figure out how we can have a system within SNAP that doesn't cut families off too soon, and helps to smooth out their incomes in a way that can help to allay what is happening in terms of reports of hunger.    Again, I want to reiterate what Co-Chair said, we do not make any recommendations about what type of labor laws and labor practices there should be, but we do recognize it as an issue, and we heard about it in the field.    Dr. Chilton. And that it should also be incentivized. What made those groups be able to coalesce together was they had some incentive to work together. And also we recognized, when we were in Texas, and seeing what the Texas Hunger Initiative was doing, we recognized it really takes very strong leadership in the local community. We saw a really extraordinary summer feeding program in Anthony, Texas, where they were employing teenagers, 70 teenagers, to help package the food, and help distribute it out to members of their community. That was extraordinary, and that was good public-private partnership. That was a way of leveraging Federal funds, and using community funds, to get really good nutritious food to families in the summertime. It was very exciting to see that, and we hope that Congress can find ways to incentivize that further.    The Chairman. Well, again, thank you both for being here. The difficulty we all have is this is a broad issue with a lot of aspects, and finding a 30 second sound bite to answer this, about the attention span of many of us, is proving difficult. We also spent a lot of time talking past each other. One side uses an extreme of a 27 year old surfer, and the other side uses the extreme of folks that no one would argue ought to come off the benefits. Dr. Chilton, even you, when we were talking you mentioned that it is hard for families to come off too quickly, but you corrected yourself.    Dr. Chilton. Yes.    The Chairman. Even there we were talking about families, we are--so we all use these--and in good faith. No one wants anybody hungry. There is no one who would argue that we need more hunger in this country, and we are all against it. I appreciate the comments, at least in your testimony, about the impact of families, and jobs, and education, and the personal responsibility we have with respect to what we are all struggling with as we move forward.    Again, thank you for what you have done. I am looking forward to your recommendations, as you complete your report. You are doing the Lord's work, so to speak, and I appreciate your efforts, and also the efforts of trying to find a consensus among yourselves. I sensed a bit of a struggle on certain issues.    Dr. Chilton. It is all very friendly.    The Chairman. Obviously, we do the same thing here. You appear to have broken through those barriers in a way that should be instructive to us, but none of us have all the answers. I, for one, don't know everything I need to know about it. Maybe there some folks on our Committee who know everything they ever need to know about this issue. I don't, and so that is the rationale behind this long look. We think it is an appropriate look. You spent a year looking at it in a deeper way than we can, and I appreciate getting your report in a month or so, and being able to evaluate and analyze it. So, again, thank you very much.    Under the rules of the Committee, today's record of the hearing will remain open for 10 days to receive additional material and supplemental written responses from the witnesses to any questions posed by a Member. This hearing of the Committee of Agriculture is adjourned. Thank you.
