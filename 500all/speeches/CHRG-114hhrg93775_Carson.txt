    Mr. Carson. Thank you, Chairman.    Mr. Cox--well, Mayor, my com director used to work for KCPW. She wants to meet you. But I will let you guys talk later. And she is from your State.    Mr. Cox, many of us have worked hard, as you know, to reauthorize the DBE program at DOT, most recently, in MAP-21. We are starting now to work on the new highway reauthorization, but it has been deeply disappointing to discover weak oversight, quite frankly, with regards to this program described in the Department of Transportation inspector general's report.    Now, Federal agencies, sir, as you well know, say they rely on State and local agencies for data with regards to contracting and subcontracting. But I want to make sure that small and disadvantaged businesses will be able to participate. Could you tell us, sir, with your expertise, about things that are being done to improve the performance of the DBE program?    Mr. Carson. This is for both of you. Many of us were pleased about the announcement that the Department of Transportation has started steps to enable vehicle-to-vehicle communication for light vehicles in particular.    Now, I think we all know that this technology will improve the safety of most of hopefully our constituents and U.S. citizens. What can you tell us about this new technology and how it is being tested in your States? And are there early reports or even trends that you would like to share with us about how we can make our roads safer?    Mr. Carson. Sure.    Mr. Carson. Thank you, Mayor.    Mr. Carson. Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.
