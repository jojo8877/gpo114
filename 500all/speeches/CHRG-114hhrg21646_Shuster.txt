    Mr. Shuster. Thank you, Chairman Gibbs, and thank you Ranking Member Napolitano for holding this hearing today.    This is a critical part of getting back to a 2-year, every Congress process where we conduct oversight of WRDA and authorize these projects.    So today, looking at these two Chief's Reports and these Post-Authorization Change Reports, it's critical we do this to make sure that it is in the next WRDA bill as we move forward hopefully here in the coming days and weeks or at least months.    I really want to especially thank General Jackson and General Semonite for your swift action on the Upper Ohio River, the Emsworth, Dashields, and Montgomery Locks Facilities, which is critical to the Port of Pittsburgh, one of the Nation's busiest inland ports.     I cannot thank you enough for that speed. We hope and I understand talking to General Semonite that you are doing some standardization, and you want to do that to make sure we save dollars and, again, be able to use the taxpayers' dollars wisely. And as Representative Napolitano said, and I echo her words, we are not investing the way we should in these locks and dams. It is a critical part of our infrastructure, and it is one of the reasons this country is a great economic power, going back 200 years, because of the rivers and the ports and the harbors we have in this country.    So, again, thanks for being here today, and I yield back.
