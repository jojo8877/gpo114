    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Livingston, I have an article which talks about the $336,000 TSA paid IBM for producing an app. This article says ``When an app isn't much more than a random number generator, it is hard to imagine how it could cost that much for the development alone, but it is typical of government spending.''    And I understand from the staff that you once recommended an analysis that another employee refused to do that--and ended up spending $12 million on a project that should have cost just $3 million. Would you tell us about that and any other examples of huge waste that you have seen on your watch?    Mr. Duncan. Well, it may not sound like much to those in the Federal Government, but I can tell you, it sounds like a lot to the average person out there when you pay $12 million for something that should have cost $3 million.    Do either of you, Mr. Rhoades, Mr. Brainard, have you seen examples of waste in your positions?    Mr. Duncan. Well, the easiest thing in the world is to spend other people's money.    Mr. Brainard ----    Mr. Duncan. Well, I understand that there have been other software developers who, just for fun, have created a similar app at almost no cost, and to pay $336,000 to IBM was a total rip-off, it seems to me.    Mr. Duncan. Yes, Mr. Livingston--Dr. Livingston?    Mr. Duncan. All right. Well, let me mention one other thing since my time is running out. Mr. Rhoades, I understand that you think that the wait times at the Minneapolis airport have been falsified. Is that correct? And have you heard about that happening in other locations, too?    Mr. Duncan. All right. Thank you very much.
