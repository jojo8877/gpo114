    Mr. Davidson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Cheng, in your comments you mentioned a Chinese program called One Satellite, Two Bombs. What does that mean and what does it stem from?    Mr. Davidson. Thanks for that.    One of the ways that the United States collaborated with China with commercial technology, pseudo-commercial technology, was to help them launch multiple low-Earth orbit satellites off of one launch vehicle. Is anyone familiar with this program wherein the early 1990s almost immediately after removing release-of-sensitive-technology authority from Defense and giving it to Commerce, we helped China develop this technology? Was that good collaboration?    Mr. Davidson. Iridium, I think.    Mr. Davidson. Okay. Mr. Chairman, could I yield 30 seconds to my colleague, Mr. Bridenstine?    Mr. Davidson. Thank you.    And I want to tie that together in terms of collaboration, sometimes perhaps some ways that have benefited us, some ways that have not been beneficial to us. Clearly, the whole panel has talked a lot about soft power, and I'm curious, where is China particularly successful with existing space powers like Russia, like European countries, but also with non-space powers. So how has China been successful with their use of soft power in their space program?    Mr. Davidson. Thank you, and I apologize because I have very little time, but I was glad you connected the One Belt, One Road, and Mr. Cheng in particular referenced China's ability to stay on a unified, coherent national strategy, and I would argue that since the end of the Cold War, they have been the single nation that has done that with success.    Mr. Chairman, my time is expired.
