    Dr. Roe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I am sorry I had to leave. I had to go to the House floor to testify on a VA bill. So I missed some of the testimony. And I am going to back up a little bit and just ask a few questions.    So someone can walk me through, how is the FFRDC, how and why and when is it used? It's as simple as that? I want to ask that question first.    Dr. Roe. Walk me through why you would need them at all.    Dr. Roe. I heard that testimony. My question is just give me an example of where they would be used. Why would the VA need to use this organization?    Dr. Roe. Is that a private corporation, private company,     Dr. Roe. Okay. It's federally funded then, okay.    Dr. Roe. Okay. But Federal dollars flow to that. Correct?    Dr. Roe. Go ahead. I'll let you finish.    Dr. Roe. Well GAO indicates that maybe that is not happening. At least from the GAO report that I read, that maybe that isn't happening right now.    And the FFRDC, who do they report to? What is their chain of command, and where are they located in the Federal Government, what department?    Dr. Roe. So it is a nonprofit, outside the Federal Government?    Dr. Roe. Okay. So it is a federally funded----    Dr. Roe . Outside, and again with the choice--the chairman just said, and how long have they been in existence?    Dr. Roe. Okay so they are a contracting authority then.    Dr. Roe. Yeah. I guess the reason I am trying to understand is exactly what their purpose is because there is another way you do this. I have been in public service before I got here, and we didn't use anything like this complicated to get a contract done.    I mean there's a way to get a contract. You have basically whether you are building something or whether it is a technical service or whatever, there is a way to bid those out, unless this is just a consultant that you use. Is that basically what this is? A consulting is you're asking their opinion? It is a pretty expensive opinion, I think.    Dr. Roe. So basically they are a consulting--is that what they do?    Dr. Roe. So what you are saying is they're supposed to be an unbiased observer that looks at whatever you, and gives you an unbiased opinion. Is that correct?    Dr. Roe. That's what they are supposed to do. How many people work there? What kind of budget do they have? And is this for all of government?    Dr. Roe. They weren't involved in Aurora, were they? Did they have anything to do with any of that?    Dr. Roe. Do you know, I mean seriously, were they?    Dr. Roe. I would like to have that answered because if they were, they need to be fired, whoever was there.    Dr. Roe. I yield back.
