    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I just would like to read and quote the Washington Post from 2012 regarding the cost of regulations issued by various precedents. In the last 10 fiscal years, the highest costs were imposed in 2007. The last three years of the Bush administration saw higher regulatory costs than the three years of the Obama administration. If you are looking for the year with the highest regulatory costs on record, you will have to go all the way back to 1992, under President George W. Bush. So I want the record to reflect that because it is always great to come here and make statements that do not reflect the reality. And so, look, we work in this Committee to make sure that we create a climate that is conducive for small businesses to continue to do what you do best, and that is creating jobs. But there has to be a balance, and we are trying to strike that balance here.    Mr. Eisenbrey, we have heard from some of the witnesses today that their salaried workers get workplace flexibility and benefits, like healthcare and paid time off that they will otherwise not get if paid hourly. Is it realistic for the DOL to take these other benefits into account when setting a higher threshold, and how do we value them?    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. So currently, only about 11 percent of salaried workers qualify for overtime.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Correct. The rules include an automatic inflationary adjustment. Why is this needed in the final rule?    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.    Mr. Settles, the duty test is an analysis of an employee's work duties and it is used to determine exemption eligibility. However, the DOL's proposed regulations did not propose any specific changes; rather, they asked for comments on how best to alter it. Mr. Settles, what is the best way to update the duty test to accurately reflect business reality?    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
