    Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Chairman Graves.    Mr. Kirpalani, your clients, my understanding, are GoldenTree Asset Management, Merced Capital, Tilden Park Capital Management, and the Whitebox Advisors. Is that correct?    Mr. LaMalfa. When did your clients buy most of their COFINA bonds? Was it before or after 2014?    Mr. LaMalfa. So it is fair to say most of those bonds were bought after it was well known that Puerto Rico was distressed and bought them for less than original investors had paid for them?    Mr. LaMalfa. So you think it is a mixture. Not all recent purchases----    Mr. LaMalfa. OK. So these are hedge funds. They regularly seek out situations where, especially post-2014, they are looking to invest in a situation where there is trouble?    Mr. LaMalfa. OK. That sounds good.    Now, some of these bonds are not due for quite a few years, a decade or maybe even two decades. But my understanding is that you have been asking the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to start repaying sooner than they would have under the original agreement. So, with Puerto Rico being in such a cash-stressed situation, why would these particular investments, especially the more late-arriving investments, go to the head of the line for repayment with that much stress?    Mr. LaMalfa. For those that would go ahead of their contracted time, though, isn't that kind of stepping out of line? Wouldn't that be kind of a windfall for those?    Mr. LaMalfa. OK. Thank you for your answers. I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
