    Mr. Chabot. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to commend you for bringing this legislation before the committee today. Russian aggression continues to violate Ukraine's political and economic sovereignty. And unfortunately, it has gone largely unrebuked around the world. If stability and peace is ever to be reestablished in Ukraine, it is vital that the people of Ukraine have the freedom to choose their own representatives, as well as take the necessary steps to ensure that their own future, without the coercion and vicious tactics orchestrated by Putin, is possible.    As the shining example of freedom and democracy, America has a duty to support the Ukranians seeking constitutional reform and free and fair elections. This measure recognizes those realities and reasserts our support for the Ukranian people to freely elect their own government. It is a timely measure. I urge its adoption, and I yield back.
