    Mr. Hinojosa. Thank you, Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott for holding this important hearing today. And thanks to all the panelists for your testimony.    In these current economic challenges, I believe that it is vitally important that our nation protect the rights of American workers; to achieve this goal, and to be effective, we must get through the demagoguery and allow the National Labor Relations Board to do its job.    In many of the questions that have been asked, I can identify with the concerns that have been asked by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. My first question is going to be to Dr. Elise Gould.    What is the relationship between the rising inequality and stagnant wages? And what role does the decline in union density play in the wage stagnation and decline of the middle class?    Mr. Hinojosa. My next question would be to Professor Robert Bruno. Your testimony says that right-to-work can increase the poverty rate. What is the evidence for this?    Mr. Hinojosa. Next question to Mr. Mark Mix. Mr. Mix, in your testimony, you state your views of right-to-work. The question is whether you have provided an imprecise characterization of that term. Here is what your testimony says. ``Right-to-work is the simple freedom to choose whether or not to financially support the labor union that has imposed its monopoly power over you.''    But section 14(b) of NLRA says something very different; and I quote, it says, ``Nothing authorizes the execution or application of agreements requiring membership in a labor organization as condition of employment in any state or territory where the state or territory prohibits such agreement.''    So your description of right-to-work seems to overlook what we think is a key qualifier; mainly, section 14(b) of the NLRA, which allows states to pass laws that bar union dues as a condition of employment.
