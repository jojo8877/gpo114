    Dr. Babin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to ask a question of Secretary Darcy. It is my understanding that the Port of Houston, which I represent, and the Corps of Engineers have identified a significant safety concern along the Houston Ship Channel at what we call Bayport Flare; and there is a challenge in finding the appropriate authority to effectively address this situation. It is also my understanding that this is primarily because of a project 902 limit which is restricting the Corps' ability to fix the Bayport Flare.    While 902 is an important provision that helps control costs, it should not be an impediment to addressing an immediate navigation safety concern. If a local entity like the Port of Houston wants to work with the Corps to address these sorts of critical safety concerns, is the Corps permitted to grant a waiver to the 902 limit and allow this critical safety issue to be addressed? Do you have that waiver authority, or will it take congressional authorization? Do you know?    Dr. Babin. OK. Would you support legislation that would give the Corps the ability to grant 902 waivers under these circumstances if it is a safety concern?    Dr. Babin. Well, we had a collision down at the Port of Houston just a few weeks ago, and I am not blaming the Bayport Flares for this because it was not in that area, but with shipping soon to be coming from Panama, the Bayport Flares need to be widened and deepened as well. So what are you suggesting? Can you give me some specifics on what other entities might be able to help us with this situation?    Dr. Babin. It is a problem. Very much one. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
