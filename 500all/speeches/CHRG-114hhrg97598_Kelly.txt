    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Everyone here today would agree that the Mexican Government must work to enhance security in their country. The violent crime that takes place in some places in Mexico, taking into consideration what my colleague just said, often resonates across the border here in the United States and simply cannot be ignored.    We know that American firearms often turn up at crime scenes in Mexico. In March, the ATF reported that out of 104,850 guns traced between 2009 and 2014, 70 percent originated in the United States. Mr. Harris, I'm sure that Customs and Border Patrol encounters many guns at the border. Do you agree that the consistent flow of firearms from the U.S. Across the border to Mexico is a serious problem?    Ms. Kelly. Thank you.    In 2008, the Mexican ambassador to the United States pled with the U.S. to do something to help stem the flow of weapons into his country, saying, ``Between Texas and Arizona alone, you've got 12,000 gun shops along that border with Mexico, and a lot of these gun shops provide weapons that feed into organized crime in Mexico. So we really need the support of the United States.''    Ms. Saarnio, do you agree with that, American firearms are contributing to the violence within Mexico or some parts of Mexico?    Ms. Kelly. This is a tremendous problem because one of the principal tactics used by criminals to obtain these weapons is straw purchasing. And I know my colleagues have already raised this issue, and I'm proud to join Ranking Member Cummings and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney to introduce the bipartisan Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2015, House Resolution 3455. I feel this bill will close this glaring loophole and would help with the issue. So thank you.    And I yield back.
