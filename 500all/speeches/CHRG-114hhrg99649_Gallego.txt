    Mr. Gallego. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Lieutenant General Stewart, so what I am hearing here, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, are the four national threats. We all agree on that. And global jihad is our growing transnational threat. And part of what makes answering these difficult is that they all require very different approaches to deal with them.    So terrorism requires more special forces; China, you know, requires us to have a strong maritime and naval capability; the Russians require the ground forces; and Iran and Korea will continue to use asymmetrical tools to basically mess with us.    From your perspective, is the U.S. meeting these threats with the right balance of resources at this point or into the future? And does refocus towards Asia or the proposed rotational brigade that we are having going through Eastern Europe, for example, allocate our resources smartly enough, or is this an area where we are probably missing the mark, now and maybe looking 5 years forward?    General Stewart. So I am always hesitant to talk about the right force construct, because that really is an intelligence question, and I would defer to the service chief and the chairman to talk about the right force construct. Certainly in my conversations and in the things that we have reported, we have explained the totality of the threat, the challenges that we face. And I think, I would like to defer to the services and the chairman to talk about what is the right construct military forces.    Mr. Gallego. I yield back.
