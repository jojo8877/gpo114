    Mr. Sires. I want to start by thanking Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel for their work on global health and their efforts to mark up this bill. I would also like to thank the many members of this committee who have cosponsored this bill and all the staff that worked on this bill.    H.R. 2241, the Global Health Innovation Act, is a bill that will provide the oversight needed to gain a clearer picture of USAID's global health research and development. Over the years, research and development projects have greatly expanded at USAID in searching for advancement toward an HIV- and AIDS-free generation, in preventable maternal and childhood death, and preventable infectious disease.    This legislation is an effort to keep up with the scope of USAID's expanded effort and ensure their research and development activities reflect their goals and priorities. This report asks them to provide clarity on their goals and metrics to better understand their work. H.R. 2241 directs the USAID's Administrator to report annually to Congress on the development and use of global health innovations in USAID's programs, projects, and activities.    The report must also include how the Agency measures progress, investment, and development toward their health-related goals. Lastly, the amendment I introduced will sunset this requirement after five reports.    I thank the committee for their time and urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back.
