    Mr. Hinojosa. Thank you, Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott. I support President Obama's Fiscal Year 2017 budget for the Department of Health and Human Services because the administration's priorities for HHS support the well-being of all Americans, and are closely aligned with the needs of my congressional district.    Madam Secretary, it is a pleasure to have you testify before this committee, and I want to ask the chairman as a member of this committee for unanimous consent that the three pages of my opening remarks be included in today's report.    Mr. Hinojosa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary, as you know, the State of Texas did not expand Medicaid, and that has hurt us a great deal. I am pleased to hear of your efforts to incentivize these vital programs. In your view, why is it important for States to expand Medicaid?    Mr. Hinojosa. Thank you. Parental engagement and involvement has been one of the most critical if not the most critical part of a Head Start program over the last 50 years. This holistic approach ensures that children are ready for school. How does this proposed rule for Head Start strengthen parental involvement?    Mr. Hinojosa. Thank you for that clarification. Thank you, Madam Secretary. Helping children and young people who qualify for help through DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is very important to my region because I have such a large number of students, K-12, who qualify.    How do the priorities in your proposal help them?    Mr. Hinojosa. Thank you. Madam Secretary, the ACA has been instrumental in increasing access to health care for residents in my district and across the Nation. What can communities such as mine do to increase participation in ACA's health insurance marketplace? What are some of the best practices that you can share?    Mr. Hinojosa. Madam Secretary, in my district, the uninsured was 40 percent before ACA. Today, it is only 18 percent. So, we have made great progress. Thank you.
