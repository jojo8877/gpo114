    Mr. Trott. I want to thank Chairman Smith and Chairman Ros-Lehtinen for holding this hearing. And there's no question that Iran is guilty of egregious human rights violations. They continue to manipulate the election process to prevent peaceful and fair elections. They severely restrict civil liberties, commit repeated religious freedom abuses, show disrespect for the physical integrity of its people through arbitrary detentions and torture and killing.    Other problems include sanctioned amputations and rape and flogging and punishment for politically motivated violence. It is not surprising that the World Press Freedom Index ranked Iran 173rd out of 180 countries with respect to human rights violations.    This hearing is timely for two reasons. First, we have to continue to shine a light and show the terrible abuses that are happening with respect to human rights in Iran, and secondly, Secretary Kerry continues to tell us that we can trust and rely on our negotiations with them and that they need more time. And for me, I submit that a country that is guilty of such egregious abuse cannot be trusted, should not be trusted, and is not worthy of the respect of the world community. Thank you for being here today.
