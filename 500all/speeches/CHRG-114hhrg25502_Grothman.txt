    Mr. Grothman. Thank you. I have another question here for Mr. Meyer and this goes to another thing where just, you know, the response of your agency seemed a little bit unusual. You mentioned during your testimony a situation in which Homeland Security flew an immigration witness all the way from Texas to Washington to give the committee a day-long interview. And at the beginning of the interview, committee staff were informed that the witness would not be able to answer questions related to the vulnerabilities of the EB-5 investor program. The working group was clearly identified in the committee's letters as a central--as a major reason why we wanted to talk to this guy. Can you give us what was the basis for refusing to allow the witness to speak about his staff's involvement in the interagency EB-5 working group?    Mr. Grothman. Well, we were informed that the witness would not be allowed to answer committee's questions regarding the working group.    Mr. Grothman. Was productive? Why wouldn't you have told the committee upfront before you flew this person all the way from Texas to Washington that given, I think, the working group is clearly one of the reasons why they wanted to talk to the witness, why wouldn't you have told them upfront that we're not going to talk about that?    Mr. Grothman. I guess that depends on who you talk to.    Homeland Security has produced so far only one 8-page memo to the committee on this topic. Can you know let us know when Homeland Security will produce the rest of the documents that we asked for in January?    Mr. Grothman. Okay, well, we have been waiting like 3 months. Can you let us know about when you think we're going to get the documents we have been asking for?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Can you let us know soon? Thank you.    I'll yield the remainder of my time to the chairman.
