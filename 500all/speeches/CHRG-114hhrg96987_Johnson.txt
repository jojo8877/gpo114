    Mr. Johnson. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. DelBianco, back to you. One proposal from the ICANN accountability working group is the incorporation of the agreements made between ICANN and NTIA, and the affirmation of commitments into the governing documents of ICANN. Can you elaborate for us on whether or how you think this will help improve accountability?    Mr. Johnson. OK. All right. Another question for you, then. Another proposal from the ICANN accountability working group is greater power to the constituent communities within ICANN, particularly in regards to the group's budget, operating plans, and bylaws. In addition, the community would be able to approve changes to the fundamental bylaws, and remove members of the ICANN Board. Can you share your thoughts on whether or how you think this will improve accountability?    Mr. Johnson. OK. Well, good. Final question for you, are there better or more effective ways of achieving accountability that I haven't talked to about here? You have got about 2 minutes to tell me some others, if you would like to.    Mr. Johnson. OK. Well, great. Mr. Chairman, I yield back a whole 46 seconds.
