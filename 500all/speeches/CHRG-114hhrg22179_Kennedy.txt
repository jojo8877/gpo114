    Mr. Kennedy. I will take 30 seconds.    Mr. Kennedy. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Pallone. And I want to thank the chairman for calling this hearing.    I was really excited just to get a chance to listen to all of you and understand a little bit about how the national institutes are going building out the progress. I have been bragging about you like crazy everywhere, so hopefully it is good. And very much look forward to understanding and getting some lessons learned from you about what is working well, where we can improve as other institutes are stood up around the country, how we can try to learn from your success.    Most importantly, trying to understand how Government can be a positive source for innovation and trying to lower some of the barriers to entry and the risks that local innovators take and small businesses take and trying to make sure we can spur the next generation of manufacturing here in the United States, what that also means for the workforce, integration with our workforce, workforce training, all the way up the supply chain.    So I am grateful for the opportunity to be here, grateful that all of you are willing to come testify, and look forward to learning from you over the course of the rest of the morning.    Thank you. I yield back.
