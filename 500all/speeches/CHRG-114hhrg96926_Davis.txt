    Mr. Davis. It is always tough to follow my colleague talking about engine digestion or ingestion or indigestion. So great question, Mr. Larsen.    Hey, thank you for being here. I apologize. Multiple hearings today, so if I am redundant with any of my questions, please forgive me. But I have a concern. I represent central Illinois, home to some of the manufacturers of our newer types of hobby aircraft in UAV technology, and also home to many possible users of this technology for commercial use.    And I know a lot of discussion was on the exemption program that is currently being implemented and run through the FAA. And part of my concerns have to do with some previous hearings like this, where we talked about the exemption process moving very slowly to offer commercial exemptions to those who have applied. And now, since they have sped up, what we have seen is some of the older requests being limited versus some of the newer requests in what can be done with the technology for which they have applied for the exemption.    And Mr. Whitaker, I appreciate that your process has evolved at the FAA, but I think there is--there might be a concern where older applicants and older exemptions that were issued may need to have some of the newer flexibility that some of the newer exemptions that are being issued currently enjoy.    So, can you tell me? Is there a process in place at the FAA right now to look at some of the older applications to see if they need that same type of flexibility? And, if so, are you going to do that unilaterally, or is that something that the previous applicants have to do?    Mr. Davis. So they would have to come back personally to change the operational conditions that they----    Mr. Davis. Well, please do. It is a concern of those in my district----    Mr. Davis . Who have been possibly granted exemptions that may now be outdated.    Mr. Davis. And I do believe--and I hope that you take this back--that we need to have some flexibility in that process, because the technology has changed, even over the time that this program, this exemption program, was implemented.    Mr. Davis. And the technology that is being produced in my district is going to continue to evolve unless we, the Federal Government, stop its ability to evolve and to continue to grow into what I think should be commercial usage, and a much more flexible commercial usage for UAV technology, and to do it in a safe way. But I don't think--I think that can happen.    And while I have time left, I will not butcher your name like--my colleague, Mr. Larsen, didn't either, since I wasn't here to get the correct pronunciation. I will call you Dr. K again, too.    Mr. Davis. Can you give me an idea of how maybe transponder technology could be helpful in avoiding some of the collisions, some of the issues that I think the FAA is facing right now, and we are, too, as policymakers?    Mr. Davis. Doesn't that transponder technology work at lower level flights, like life flights?    Mr. Davis. So the technology for lightweight transponder technology does not currently exist for the newer versions of UAV. Right?    Mr. Davis. An entrepreneur's dream, or an entrepreneurial dream.    Mr. Davis. And how do you pronounce your last name, since I don't have any more time?    Mr. Davis. Thank you. I yield back.
