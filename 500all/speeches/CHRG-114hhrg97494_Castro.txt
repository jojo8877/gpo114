    Mr. Castro. Thanks, Chairman. I know that we talked about the competitiveness of the process in contracting and how it has become dominated over the years by a smaller group of companies. Some of that is due to consolidation. We also talked about how hard it is for commercial enterprises to break into defense work.    So I guess let me ask you, we also have in front of us information on the cost overruns and breaches for each of the divisions. Is there any penalty for a contractor who experiences a cost overrun on a contract? Or I should ask what is the penalty?    Mr. Castro. And is it fair to say that over the years particular contractors have again and again gone over on cost?    Mr. Castro. Let me ask you this. We have been speaking about each contract individually. Is a contractor who consistently overruns penalized when they bid for a new contract? In other words, with consumers, for example, many of us are subject to credit scores; right? So if we demonstrate bad credit over a period of time, there is a penalty when you try to get credit next time. Does the same principle apply with contracting here?    Mr. Castro. Are they not ruled out because there are simply not enough options that we have? In other words, is there such a limited number of these contractors that you just can't go anywhere else?    Mr. Castro. Well, but is it safe to say, that the Department of Defense has the most overruns, and the cost is the highest of any of the agencies of the Federal Government? You are part of the GAO, so I assume----    Mr. Castro. So there are more overruns and more breaches?    Mr. Castro. Thanks. My time is up. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Thank you. Ms. Stefanik.
