    Mrs. Maloney. Okay. Thank you very much and thank you for this hearing, all of your testimony, and I join this chairman in really underscoring that you should not be eliminating review processes, but strengthening them, and certainly, knowing the problem that we haven't, we shouldn't be reducing what we're spending, but we should be maintaining it, hopefully growing on it.    But I want to go back to the conversations we've been having on opiates, that they've been prescribed very deeply and strongly and the increase of prescriptions for it. Are you tracking whether the prescriptions are coming from doctors or are there illegal prescriptions?    Mrs. Maloney. And also there are reports that people on opiates then become addicted to heroin. Have you been tracking that? Apparently heroin is cheaper than the opiates. Is that in your database, one of the questions you ask, were you on an opiate before you went to heroin? And then often heroin goes to crime. So----    Mrs. Maloney. Well, is there any punishment to doctors that abuse these opiates? I thought the example from Congressman Lynch was astonishing, that the woman had teeth pulled out of her head to get pain medicine. Obviously the doctor was incompetent if he was pulling out of her head teeth that did not deserve to be extracted. And so what is the punishment for a doctor for prescribing pain killers or any medicine inappropriately?    Mrs. Maloney. How is it a huge cash business? They just get money for prescribing the drug?    Mrs. Maloney. And my time is almost up, but I did want to ask you, I guess Mr. Maurer, about the GAO released report on ONDCP's coordination efforts of drug abuse prevention. The report identified an overlap in 59 of the 76 programs included in the GAO's review. And what is the possible impact of this overlap and why did you raise that in your report?    Mrs. Maloney. That's a very fine success.    My time has expired. Thank you.
