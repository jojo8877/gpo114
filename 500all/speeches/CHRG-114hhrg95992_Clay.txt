    Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let me thank all the witnesses for being here today.    Agency leaders can and must use the resources at their disposal to build inclusive, motivating, and productive work environments. However, we must recognize that Congress has repeatedly asked these agencies to do more with less. This is a problem within itself and no doubt prevents agencies from operating at their full potential.    Mr. Ferriero, according to a recent NARA staffing report, NARA's Federal Record Center Holdings have grown from 14.4 million cubic Federal--feet of records in 1985 to 29.5 million cubic feet in 2013. Despite a doubling in the workload, you have about half the employees you had in 1985.    Has NARA received sufficient funding to keep pace with the rapidly increasing volume of documents under it's management?    Mr. Clay. And how has that affected employee morale?    Mr. Clay. And so, Mr. Chairman, this raises a valid point. When we think about the ratings of these agencies, if we as the legislature don't give the proper resources to adequately pay employees, to adequately fund these agencies, who happen to be, for the most part, domestic agencies, even DHS, then we are doing a disservice to the agencies also. And I just want to bring that up, not to debate that issue here. This isn't the place for it, but it also raises a real issue, Mr. Chair.    Mr. Clay. Thank you.    Ms. Emerson, DHS was created through a merger of 22 agencies following the 9/11 attacks. Today DHS is tasked with securing our airports and patrolling our waterways and borders, among other vital responsibilities, yet my colleagues across the aisle have made DHS funding the object of political gamesmanship. What are the inherent challenges or managing a department tasked with such a diverse array of responsibilities? What are some of your challenges?    Mr. Clay. Sure.    Mr. Clay. Yeah. And hopefully our colleagues are listening to you all's concern and the points that you raise today.    Mr. Goldenkoff, government-wide Federal employee engagement has declined 4 percentage points from 2011 to 2014. However, the majority of Federal agencies have either sustained or increased employee engagement levels during this time. NASA, FIDIC, Service Transportation Board and U.S. Trade and Development Agency all topped at 2014 PPS best places to work rankings.    Additionally, the Department of Education's engagement levels increased at an estimated 56 percent.    Based on your research, what are theses agencies doing right?    Mr. Clay. Thank you, and my time is up, but apparently respect goes a long way, so appreciate it, Mr. Chairman.
