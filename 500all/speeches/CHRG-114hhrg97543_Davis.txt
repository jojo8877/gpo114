    Mr. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The wonderful opportunity we have to ask questions sometimes at the end of the hearing means that all the questions I had written have already been taken. But that is okay. My colleagues, they know I am never at a shortage of being able to use my time to ask any other questions.    This is an issue that is very important to me, since I represent central Illinois, and what I would consider the breadbasket of America and the world. And agro-terrorism is a concern that I don't think many of my constituents think about. So the discussion we have had here today, going along with your written testimony, Ambassador, you mentioned the problem that gets talked about in this Committee a lot, is we have to feed millions more people in the future with the technology, the land, and the products that we have today. So how do we continue to make America even more productive, even though we are the safest and most productive food suppliers in the world?    And, Dr. Beckham, in your written testimony, you actually stated the very elements that make the U.S. agricultural system robust and productive, also make it vulnerable to an incident. I am the father of three kids. I mean that is very scary to me, and something that I don't normally think about on a daily basis, and we hear some things that make you really scared as a parent. We have to feed nine billion people by 2050, and as you know, we have to continue to lead. And with that in mind, how do we increase our ag production both in your industry and in the grain industry too? What can we do, and how does biotechnology play a role in this?    Mr. Davis. How do we get some of our allies to be able to take the biotechnological products that we produce, that can produce more, that we are going to need, how do we stop them from implementing policies that don't allow us to do that?    Mr. Davis. Yes.    Mr. Davis. This is fascinating to me. And your discussion about biosurveillance programs and what we need to do to do that in addition to producing more here in America is something that I hope this Committee continues to look at and highlight. And I want to commend the Chairman for having both of you here today. So thank you for your time today.    And I will yield back the balance of my time.    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back.    Mr. Rouzer, 5 minutes.
