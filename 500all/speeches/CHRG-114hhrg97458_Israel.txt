    Mr. Israel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you so much for joining us. I wanted to chat with you about Israeli missile defense capabilities. Two questions, really. One, can you give us a sense or your assessment of Iran's ballistic missile capabilities? There has been a lot of talk about Iran's nuclear program. I am very skeptical, deeply skeptical that we can get a deal with Iran; deeply more skeptical that if we do get a deal with Iran, it will work. Most of the talk has been focused on Iran's nuclear capabilities, but not a lot of talk in terms of their delivery capabilities, so if you could talk to that first----    Mr. Israel . And then I am going to ask a couple of questions, with the chairman's consent, about Israel's own capabilities.                                ------                                    Mr. Israel. And you noted that the Iranians have a longer way to go with respect to any kind of serious ICBM capability, but they are working that capability, correct?                                ------                                    Mr. Israel. Thank you. Final question, if I have the time----    Mr. Israel . Mr. Chairman.    Last night I had dinner with Israel's ambassador to the U.S., Ambassador Dermer, and we were talking about Israel's ballistic missile defense capabilities, and one of the things he talked about was, you know, they are in pretty good shape on Iron Dome, they are developing nicely on Arrow 2 and Arrow 3. His concern was that there is still this gap with respect to David's Sling, that they just haven't yet figured out how to deal with what Iron Dome can't take care of and what Arrow 2 and 3 can not or will not take care of.    So where are we with David's Sling and what needs to happen?                                ------                                -- -- --    Mr. Israel. If we would increase funding for David's Sling, is it possible, given all the right contingencies, that it could be in production before the end of 2016, do you believe?    Mr. Israel. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Israel. Cigar summit. Let's do it.    Mr. Israel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, it is good to be reunited with you. We miss you in New York delegation meetings.    And, General, it is good to be with you. You were kind enough to give me an aerial tour of Balad when we were there together, and we worked together on professional military education when I was on the HASC. And it is great to be with you.    Just a quick congratulations and then a question. I do want you to know that I appreciate your efforts to integrate women into all positions in the Army. In fact, one of my former Army fellows is currently in the pre-Ranger course. I value that program. I value the opportunities that you provide. So I want to congratulate you for that.    Mr. Secretary, I want to talk to you about something you have a deep proficiency on. That is Fort Drum. You used to represent Fort Drum. You remember those days.    Mr. Israel. As I understand it, as the Army prepares for a possible reduction in troop strength of 475,000 or less, Fort Drum has become one of the bases that may lose some units. On March 19 Congresswoman Elise Stefanik sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Carter signed by, I believe, every member of the New York delegation and our two Senators expressing some concern about potential cuts at Fort Drum. And I was wondering whether you could just comment on where we are with that. Are the concerns well founded? And what is the status?    Mr. Israel. Well, I appreciate your candor. And I just want to state, I do not represent Fort Drum. As you know, Mr. Secretary, I am as far away from Fort Drum as you can be and still be in the same state of New York.    Mr. Israel. But I think we all recognize, on both sides of the aisle and throughout the Army, the value of Fort Drum, the value of the men and women there, and I hope that we can come to a good resolution on this.    Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you.    Mr. Israel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    General Robb, a very specific question about scleroderma research. This is something that I have been working on. You may not have the exact answer at your fingertips, but if you would commit to looking into it for me and getting back to me, I would be very grateful.    I have been involved in the issue of scleroderma research for some time, and it is linked to cancer as an acceptable study area that could be funded under the Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program. It was included in the subcommittee's recommendations last year but was not included in the final version of our bill. And I would appreciate it if you would take a look at this and advise me on whether studying a disease like scleroderma, which is not cancer but is an indicator of predicting cancer, is a worthwhile study area to be included in the PRCRP.    General Robb. Yes, I will be glad to do that. And as you know, with our Murtha Cancer Center and also our relationship with the National Institutes of Health and with their national cancer programs over there, I think we have got a bed of knowledge that we can go back and see what we can do for you, yes, sir.    Mr. Israel. I appreciate that. I will have another question on the second round having nothing to do with this, but I will hold to the second round.
