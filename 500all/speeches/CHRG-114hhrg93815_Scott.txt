    Mr. Scott. Thank you, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Kehoe, does your testimony include the statement that the EEOC does not have the authority to issue regulations under Title 7?    Mr. Scott. Well, I just want to enter into the record with unanimous consent the Title 7 U.S.--42 USC 2000e-12 subsection (a), ``The Commission shall have the authority from time to time to issue, amend, rescind suitable procedural regulations to carry out the provisions of this chapter. Regulations issued under this section shall be in conformity with the standards and limitations of subsection two.'' I would like unanimous consent to have this in the record?    Mr. Scott. Thank you.    Ms. House, can you remind us why the Griggs decision was so important?    Mr. Scott. Right. If you didn't have the disparate impact--if you had a discrete person with ill intent, what would happen if you didn't have Griggs?    Mr. Scott. Now, if you had a disparate impact but it was job-related, would Griggs prohibit the consideration of a job-related criteria, although it had a disparate impact?    Mr. Scott. It would not? Does federal law guidance--does EEOC guidance require employees--employers to hire those with criminal records in violation of state law?    Mr. Scott. How does Ban the Box fit into this discussion?    Mr. Scott. Does the Banning the Box prohibit consideration of criminal records?    Mr. Scott. Now, is the guidance consistent with or in violation of the Griggs principle?    Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
