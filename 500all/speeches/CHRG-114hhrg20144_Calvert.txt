    Mr. Calvert. Good morning, and welcome to the subcommittee's oversight hearing on the President's fiscal year 2017 budget for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. I am pleased to welcome back Dan Ashe, Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, and Chris Nolin, the Service budget officer.    The President is proposing a $59 million, 4 percent increase for the Fish and Wildlife Service, an increase which relies on gimmicks to skirt the cap on nondefense discretionary spending agreed to less than a year ago.    So while the Service's proposed budget is insightful insofar as the service priorities, it is not realistic. The subcommittee's challenge will continue to be to work within our allocation to ensure that the Fish and Wildlife Service has the budget necessary to carry out, first and foremost, those actions required by law, as opposed to those actions simply authorized by law.    The greatest concern continues to be the Endangered Species Act budget. Despite the law's many mandates, actions continue to be driven by lawsuits. Other mandates such as recovery plans, 5-year reviews, and status changes are put on a back burner.    That is why listed species tend to stay listed, and why people are so frustrated by the Endangered Species Act. If the government is not prepared to carry out its full responsibilities under the law, then it should not be listing species in the first place.    Granted, the Fish and Wildlife Service deserves credit for delisting 15 species over the past 8 years. But there is still a backlog of 49 waiting to be down-listed or delisted, 318 awaiting 5-year status reviews, and 1,159 awaiting recovery plans. We will ensure that the agency has the budget needed in fiscal year 2017 to continue to whittle away at these backlogs.    We also ensure that the agency continues to whittle away at the maintenance backlogs at national wildlife refuges and national fish hatcheries. The National Wildlife Refuge System backlog, for example, has declined annually since 2012, but still exceeds $1.1 billion. The fiscal year 2017 budget is not enough to keep driving that number down, so the subcommittee will appropriate an amount that will.    It is irresponsible for the Federal Government to add to its estate if it cannot even maintain what it already owns.    Last but not least, we will continue to arm the service with the resources it needs to combat international wildlife trafficking. The escalation of trafficking in recent years has put many iconic species in grave danger and has fueled the activities of those who are a threat to our national security.    Closer to home, the extended drought in California continues to threaten the Nation's food security. California produces nearly half the Nation's fruits, nuts, and vegetables. It is the Nation's largest dairy State. I am sorry to point that out to Minnesota.    The drought has cost us $1.8 billion in economic losses and 10,000 jobs. People are desperate. Unemployment and suicide rates are now among the highest in the Nation.    Now some people believe that California should return to the desert it used to be, but the fact is that the Nation cannot afford to feed its people without California, and long-term reliance on food imports makes our Nation vulnerable. We must save California's agriculture.    Witnesses in previous hearings before the subcommittee have testified that the problem is simply not enough water. If that was really the case, then we should have been able to pump and store a good portion of this winter's El Nino rains. Instead, we pumped less than last year--less.    If the Fish and Wildlife Service had simply allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to pump the maximum allowable under the biological opinion, we could have pumped enough water to serve 2 million people for an entire year, the population of San Diego and San Francisco combined. Instead, that water went out to sea, and it is not coming back.    El Nino has proven that the problem is not the quantity of water but the regulation of water. So much of the regulation is dictated by the Fish and Wildlife Service under the mandates of the Endangered Species Act, with wide latitude afforded scientific uncertainty and save-at-any-cost policy that borders on dogma.    Enough is enough. For the sake of the people of California who fuel the Nation's largest economic engine, who grow the Nation's largest fresh food supply, and who push the Nation to the cutting edge of technology, we must reconsider what the Federal Government is doing with our water. We must reconsider calling on the Endangered Species Committee.    I get that the Fish and Wildlife Service feels its hands are tied, which is why this is yet another policy matter banging on the front door of a statute long overdue for the reauthorization process. This is not about the Fish and Wildlife Service. It is not meant to be criticism of any of the thousands of outstanding scientists and other employees of the service who are faithfully executing the laws of the United States on behalf of the people and natural resources we highly value.    Along those lines, in closing, let me take a moment to recognize some of these employees in another part of the country that was recently featured so prominently in the news. I want to give a short shout-out directly to the men and women of the Fish and Wildlife Service who are working at or in support of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.    No doubt it was and continues to be a difficult ordeal for you and your families. I hope you will take some comfort in knowing that while the Nation was glued to the press, your refuge neighbors, ranchers, came to your defense and made Congress aware that cooperative conservation can work when landscape neighbors truly work together.    For your collective efforts, we commend you.    I am now pleased to yield to our distinguished ranking member, Betty McCollum, for her opening remarks.    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentlelady.    The full committee chairman is not with us today, so, Dan, you are recognized for your opening statement.                    Opening Remarks of Director Ashe    Mr. Calvert. Thank you for your testimony. I have some correspondence here from Senator Feinstein, calling for increased pumping to capture water from these El Nino storms that I would like to submit for the record, without objection.    Mr. Calvert. As I said in my opening statement, I am deeply concerned about the choices the Federal Government is making with California's water. Instead of harvesting El Nino rains to irrigate the Nation's produce and refill our reservoirs, the government is sending El Nino water underneath the Golden Gate Bridge and out to sea.    Any preconception California had had about El Nino rain providing some relief for the drought has turned out to be mostly false. And California is looking for an explanation.    The Central Valley project is capable of pumping 11,000 cubic feet of water per second. Last week, 50,000 cubic feet of water per second moved through the Delta. But pumping was restricted to 5,000 cubic feet because of the Delta smelt.    Today, 100,000 cubic feet of water per second is moving through the Delta, but pumping is still restricted to 5,000 cubic feet because of the Delta smelt.    The agencies are considering further restrictions tomorrow, as I understand it, because of salmon. In other words, yesterday, 90 percent of the Delta water was off-limits. Today, 95 percent of the water is off-limits. Tomorrow, the percentage goes higher, as much as 97 percent of the water.    No matter how much water is moving through the Delta, it seems, the fish always need more, and the Federal Government, hamstrung by the Endangered Species Act, gives it to them.    At what point, Director, does 100 percent of the Delta's water become off-limits because of the Endangered Species Act?    Mr. Calvert. What else are we doing besides restricting pumping to try to recover smelt? And is it working?    Mr. Calvert. In 2008, your Service regional director said: Just as releasing Delta smelt into a degraded Delta will fail to restore them to self-sustaining levels, so will habitat restoration efforts fail if there are not enough fish to rebuild the population.    Unfortunately, that is a very real possibility, as you point out, because the current data suggests Delta smelt populations might already be so low that they cannot be recovered without supplementation.    The Service broadcast that it was in the initial stages of planning for a new hatchery facility to propagate Delta smelt. Just last week, the Service said it is still in the planning stage. What are we waiting for? Why is this taking so long?    Mr. Calvert. One quick question, and then I am going to turn it over to the ranking for questions, because we are going to have another round on this.    One thing that has always bothered me is the nonnative striped bass, which is a predator fish, which has pretty much wiped out the native California bass and is primarily the main predator for the Delta smelt, wiping them out as we speak.    Do striped bass prey on smelt? We all know that they do. And if so, does the mandate to conserve striped bass conflict with the mandate to recover Delta smelt?    Mr. Calvert. But there are those in the area that are preserving the striped bass population.    Mr. Calvert. I will get back for another round. This is not a partisan issue.    Mr. Calvert. Senator Feinstein feels as strongly about this as I do. This is destroying the Central Valley as we know it, as I said in my opening statement.    I will turn it over to Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Do you want some smelt over there?    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Stewart.    Mr. Calvert. Sure. I do not think wolves in Utah would help the prairie dog population. Mr. Calvert. With that, Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Amodei?    Mr. Calvert. You can drill down on that in the second round.    Mr. Jenkins, you are recognized.    Mr. Calvert. Gary, would you please submit your name for the record?    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Israel.    Mr. Calvert. Will the gentleman yield just for a second?    I have been curious about the subject, because some of us serve on defense appropriations. As you know, a number of terrorist operations are involved in some of this activity to sell that to fund their various enterprises. Is there a force multiplier effect with some of our intelligence agencies that are attempting to keep track of some of these organizations that are, in fact----    Mr. Calvert. As the gentleman knows, we have a few special operators down there that can be helpful.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Well, back to my favorite subject, California. You made a comment, you said that the threat to the smelt population is primarily pumping. So we went back, we looked over the last few months.    Can you explain, considering we salvaged a total of 12 smelt this year--12--and we have let, as you know, a significant amount of that water go under the Golden Gate Bridge. Do you still believe that is the primary threat to the smelt?    Mr. Calvert. Remember, Director, today, as we sit here, 100,000 cubic feet per second--people probably have a hard time getting their mind around how much 100,000 cubic feet per second is.    Mr. Calvert. And we are pumping 5,000 cubic feet per second. So this is less than 5 percent of the flow. I just want to make that point.    The Fish and Wildlife Service designated critical habitat for the Delta smelt, if you remember, back in 1994. California's current drought started in 2011.    The Endangered Species Act directs the Secretary to make revisions to critical habitat after taking into consideration the economic impact, the impact on national security, and any other relevant impact of specifying any particular area as critical habitat.    So the question is, has the Service gone through the process of evaluating whether to make revisions to the Delta smelt critical habitat based upon economic or other impacts since 1994?    Mr. Calvert. Is it possible, if the service undergoes such an evaluation, that the service would make a determination different than the 1994 determination?    Mr. Calvert. At what point does the situation in the Delta become a fair question, a fair question to put before the Endangered Species Committee?    Mr. Calvert. Do you think it is a fair question to be put before that committee?    Mr. Calvert. As you know, I have been here for this whole process.    Mr. Calvert. And I have worked with this. We have appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars to fix this. It obviously has not worked.    Mr. Calvert. No, but there are avenues, because of economic impacts. As you know, those impacts are well-known.    Mr. Calvert. That is why I was asking the question whether or not that is a reasonable consideration.    Mr. Calvert. After 24-years-plus of working on this, and trying to come up with a solution to this problem, when we are going to release potentially today, if NOAA comes in and asks for a recommendation for the department of reclamation, when you have 100,000 cubic feet per second moving out, we are only pumping 5,000, per the past biological opinion, and they ask for us to pump less, in other words, we could actually be letting go 97 percent of the water. And that is not sufficient.    At what point is it sufficient? If 100 percent of the water is going to be let loose, then this is a total failure, in my estimation, because, the State of California has spent billions of dollars--Pat Brown, Jerry Brown's father--building this project, which basically becomes basically unusable.    That is why Senator Feinstein is frustrated. I am frustrated. Many people are frustrated.    Mr. Calvert. We have to get serious about this.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. I understand the intent. It is just that sometimes you have to have rational administrative costs. I think we will take a strong look at that and see what we can do.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Amodei.    Mr. Calvert. Well, if there are no other questions, I think I will wrap this up. I appreciate you coming out.    I know you were out in the Everglades. Ms. McCollum and I want to get out there.    I read a story yesterday somebody sent me about this python issue and the great python contest that they had down there. I do not understand why we cannot come up with a better way to track down these snakes, apparently they are totally devastating the Everglades. We need to find out a way to kill them en masse.    Mr. Calvert. This is the one instance where the chairman will be following the ranking member. Mr. Calvert. Well, it is too late for that.                                         Wednesday, March 16, 2016.LENA McDOWALL, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Mr. Calvert. Good morning. The committee will come to order.    Director Jarvis, I would like to welcome you to today's hearing, along with the park service chief financial officer, Lena McDowall. This morning's hearing will address the important work of the National Park Service and its budget priorities for fiscal year 2017.    On August 25, 1916, Woodrow Wilson signed the Organic Act, creating the National Park Service, a new Federal bureau in the Department of the Interior responsible for protecting the 35 national parks and monuments then managed by the department, and those yet to be established.    One hundred years later, the National Park Service is comprised of 410 individual park units, and that number continues to grow.    The award-winning filmmaker Ken Burns, whom this subcommittee met with 2 weeks ago, has described our national parks as America's best idea. Few Americans would disagree with that assessment. Everyone loves our national parks.    Last year, the National Park Service welcomed more than 307 million visitors to its parks, a record-breaking number, which was 14 million more visitors than the previous attendance record set in 2014. That trend will likely continue well beyond this year's centennial celebration.    Overall, the proposed funding level in your fiscal year 2017 budget request is $3.1 billion, which is $250 million, or 9 percent, above the fiscal year 2016 enacted level. The largest increase, about $191 million, in discretionary funding is proposed for the centennial-related needs and priorities. This includes sizable funding increases for deferred maintenance needs in both operation and construction accounts.    Last year, the subcommittee made a substantial investment in our national parks, providing additional funds for park operations, as well as significant funds to address longstanding deferred maintenance issues. We will endeavor to make similar investments this year within the confines of our 302(b) allocation.    Also worth noting is the proposed expansion of the so-called Centennial Challenge, which leverages Federal dollars with private-sector dollars to at least a 1-to-1 matching of funds. Congress provided $15 million for Centennial Challenge in fiscal year 2016. The administration proposes to increase the Federal share by $20 million to $35 million in 2017.    As the service prepares for its second century of stewardship of our national parks, this subcommittee looks forward to learning more about the budget request and receiving additional details of the role park service partners and the private sector will play in this effort.    We will do our very best to address the service's highest priority needs, but we also need to face our budget reality. Any increases above last year's enacted level will likely have to be offset elsewhere within the service's budget or within our overall bill.    While this subcommittee does oversee the budget for the Forest Service, we have yet to find money growing on trees in our national forests. That would be great.    Mr. Calvert. We welcome any ideas you may have on how to pay for some of the proposed increases within your budget request.    Director Jarvis, today's hearing is the beginning of a very important conversation about the service funding priorities. We look forward to hearing from you on these and other issues.    But first, let me yield to our subcommittee's ranking member, Ms. McCollum, for any opening remarks she would like to share with us this morning.               Opening Remarks of Ranking Member McCollum    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    And, Director Jarvis, as you gaze upon our oldest national park right behind me, I am happy to yield for your opening statement.                   Opening Remarks of Director Jarvis    Mr. Calvert. Without objection.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. I want to discuss for a few minutes the service's ban on bottled water in national parks, as I take a sip out of my bottled water here.    In December 2011, the National Park Service issued Policy Memorandum 11-03, which authorizes park superintendents to ban bottled water sales on a park-by-park basis. That memorandum requires that proposals for bans be based upon rigorous written impact analysis considering specified factors relating to health and safety, waste reduction, costs, impacts, concessionaires, et cetera.    The fiscal year 2016 omnibus included a directive for the service to report on the justification each affected park service unit used to ban bottled water. The report was due on February 16. It is now 1 month overdue.    So the question is, what is the status of the report? When can the committee expect it? Are you able to share with the committee any details of the report relating to the impact of these restrictions?    Mr. Calvert. As you know, many of my colleagues and I do not understand how the service can ban the sale of bottled water in the parks, which is arguably the healthiest option for park visitors, yet continue to sell soft drinks, juices, sports drinks. Monster is in my district. I am sure they love selling at the national parks. But water is, certainly, a reasonable option.    This position directly contradicts the National Park Service Healthy Parks, Healthy People initiative, which encourages healthy food and beverage choices in national parks.    So why the inconsistency? Does the service have any plans to ban the sale of soft drinks, juices, and sports drinks in the national parks?    Mr. Calvert. Well, if we are going to be selling soft drinks and all the rest of it, which obviously has the same waste streams as bottled water, would it not make more sense for the park service to partner with some of these folks to have better recycling, not just for water bottles but for any other kind of refuse, and have a better recycling program within the national parks?    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Stewart.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Stewart, in the old days, we would have directed those fundings. Mr. Calvert. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Jenkins.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Israel.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Speaking of endowments, how much does Harvard have in their endowment account right now?    Mr. Calvert. $40 billion, so at 4 percent a year, that is significant.    Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Amodei.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Israel brought up an interesting point. These budget battles, I am afraid, are not going to end. The growth of entitlement spending is squeezing discretionary accounts, we have the same problems with defense spending and interior. And certainly Mr. Simpson's bill, all of our bills, we have this challenge.    But you have the honor and privilege to represent probably the most popular government agency in the United States Government. I read somewhere the Marine Corps and the park service are tied. You are popular.    So the endowment, I am very pleased that we are moving that way. I know the authorizers are moving with the centennial bill to get language to do that.    I think you are going to find that there are going to be a lot of people who are interested in leaving some legacy to the National Park Service. I think, long term, it will have a positive effect on the national parks.    A couple questions. Obviously, you mentioned the Memorial Bridge, the necessity to move forward on that. Obviously, we have a lack of funds. We are hoping that next year, no matter who is President, we can come to some agreement on repatriation and put money into the transportation bill, which will increase those allocations, including to the National Park Service, so hopefully we can see that happen.    The other issue is in the newspaper, the White House fence. It looks like we have had a number of incursions of late. It seems like it is a growing phenomenon. Obviously, the security there is important.    I do not know if you want to get into that briefly, but I know there are artistic ramifications. And of course you manage the grounds, then you have the Secret Service and Homeland Security and everybody else.    But how is that coming along?    Mr. Calvert. Okay, good. And obviously centennial funding is important. I am going to make a wild guess here that we are going to be level-funded in our allocation. We hope. We will find out.    But we are going to do the best we can with the hand we are dealt, so we will try to work with you and the park service to make sure that we fund your top priorities and work on that. I know you have significant deferred maintenance issues that we have to deal with, and we want to help as much as we can.    Anyway, with that, are there any additional questions?    Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Will the gentlelady yield on this?    Mr. Calvert. I am as outraged about this as you are.    Mr. Calvert. As a businessman, to me, there are ethical issues involved here by some concessionaire who took advantage obviously of not notifying you of this change. How long were they the concessionaire for this location?    Mr. Calvert. So this operation was going on for many, many years prior to 1993----    Mr. Calvert . With the names that are iconic associated with Yosemite National Park. And they took it upon themselves to, in effect, take those names for their own purposes in order to, in effect, blackmail you into renewing the contract. Would that be an accurate statement?    Mr. Calvert. People talk about corporate ethics. This is just terrible.    Anyway, Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Have they taken possession of those names also?    Mr. Calvert. This gives the legal profession a bad name.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Just on that subject, thinking out of the box a little bit, is it possible a third party could acquire that property with an agreement for future acquisition back from the National Park Service?    Mr. Calvert. Could a third party, in effect, loan the National Park Service the money to acquire the property with a payback provision?    Mr. Calvert. Okay. Thank you.    With that, we certainly appreciate you coming--anything more?                                         Wednesday, March 16, 2016.                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Mr. Calvert. The committee will come to order. Good afternoon, and welcome to today's hearing on the Fiscal Year 2017 budget proposal for Indian Affairs. I am going to be brief because we have a lot of ground to cover, and obviously we have votes coming up.    Funding for Indian Country has been and will continue to be a nonpartisan funding priority for this subcommittee for Fiscal Year 2017. Today we have been making a concerted push over the past several years to make incremental improvements in the lives of American Indians and Alaska Natives, particularly in healthcare, education, and law enforcement.    It has been a partnership. I want to thank several of our key partners for being here today to testify. Our first panel includes Larry Roberts, acting assistant secretary for Interior for Indian Affairs, Mike Black, director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Monty Roessel, director of the Bureau of Indian Education. Gentlemen, thank you for being here today.    For the past few years at the subcommittee's request, the Government Accountability Office has been another key partner on Indian education matters. What started in 2012 with a seemingly simple question of comparing per student funding inside and outside of BIE has grown into something much more complex. The GAO recently completed another study on BIE facilities' condition and management, and I have asked them to be here today on a second panel to report their findings and recommendations.    Before we begin, I will just make a few comments about the Fiscal Year 2017 budget proposal for Indian Affairs. This Administration put its partners on the subcommittee in a tight spot by raising expectations throughout Indian Country that we will struggle to meet. The President's budget circumvents the discretionary spending caps that were signed into law. That is how the President is able to propose $136 million increase for Indian Affairs, and a $377 million increase for the Indian Health Service with no realistic offset.    But currently law requires discretionary spending to stay relatively flat in Fiscal Year 2017. So this subcommittee's challenge will be to find the money from within to pay for the have-to-do's without cutting the popular nice-to-do's by so much that we cannot pass a bill.    Before I turn to the first panel, let me first ask our distinguished ranking, Ms. McCollum, for any opening remarks she would like to make. Thank you.               Opening Remarks of Ranking Member McCollum    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. I thank the gentlelady. I think we have time to have your opening statement. So, Mr. Roberts, if you will do that, then we will recess until after votes. You are recognized.         Opening Remarks of Acting Assistant Secretary Roberts    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentleman for his testimony. We are going to recess until the votes, and then we will come back immediately after the last vote. Thank you.    Mr. Calvert. The committee will come to order. Ms. McCollum in her opening testimony mentioned the GAO report on the Bureau of Indian Education schools, and I share her concern about the 69 of the 180 BIE school locations that were not inspected for health and safety in Fiscal Year 2015. This, as she has said, is clearly unacceptable.    In the entire $2.9 billion Indian Affairs budget, I cannot imagine a higher priority than protecting the health and safety of children attending schools and sleeping in dormitories. Why did some BIA regions inspect all schools while others inspected no schools in recent years? Specifically, why some regions with a large number of schools and significant travel distance were able to conduct all the inspections in 2015 while others not? What is going on out there?    Mr. Calvert. On this subject, I would hope--well, not hope. We expect that we will have reports from time to time, at least quarterly, on how these inspections are going, and that you are meeting the target of inspecting all schools in this Fiscal Year. And I would like to get also a report on which employees are responsible for not inspecting these schools, and has anybody been discharged because of this? Is there any reprimand that has been done because of the inactivity of BIE to inspect these schools?    Mr. Calvert. Well, somebody should be held responsible for something like this. If it had been one of my restaurants when I was in the restaurant business, a manager would be out of a job. And this is much more important than that. It is the health and safety of children.    Ms. McCollum, you are recognized.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Amodei.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. And I would hope that BIE would be looking into the other programs. The Department of Agriculture has a Rural Assistance Program on broadband, and the Gates Foundation has been, I would hope in the State of Washington, would be looking at that. And certainly Microsoft directly, and maybe assisting on something like this.    Mr. Joyce, you are recognized.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. I agree with the gentlelady. You know, we want to do these projects as quickly as possible. We want to build a school that people expect, and we also want to make sure that the plans are done, and we do not get into change orders, in a VA kind of a situation where things spiral out of control as far as costs are concerned.    That is why I think it is always important to have somebody, a person, a project manager responsible that we can call and be held responsible for getting these projects done in a timely and economical fashion, and with the community's support. I cannot think of anything more important.    While we are on school construction, we have urged the Department and the Treasury to explore different ways to fund schools. We have a deplorable situation out there where we are way behind on school construction, and these schools are the Federal government's responsibility. And we are failing in that responsibility. They are in deplorable condition.    And our solution cannot be to just hope for funds to come available. And we have a lot of smart people out there in the finance world. We have gone through in the Department of Defense where we rebuilt all of the schools in the Department of Defense to great standards, and we owe no less to the Native Americans in this country.    We need to figure out a way to weave some kind of a tax, spending program. I am not quite sure what that is, but we have talked about it for the last year or so, where we can do something to get these schools under construction and built where we do not have these conditions.    Is the Department exploring these alternatives? And, if so, would you please update the committee on these efforts?    Mr. Calvert. Well, you know, obviously there is a way forward. Every day that goes by not doing something, we just dig ourselves into a deeper hole. And I would expect that this would be a high priority within the Department to get this done. This is a bipartisan effort. We want to make sure this is completed. We do not want to talk about this again next year. We would like to figure out a way to do this and get it done, and maybe, if it is necessary, to have language in this year's appropriation bill.    Mr. Calvert. Hoping we get through an appropriation bill, but that is another subject.    But with that, Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. If there are no further questions, we are going to wrap this up in a minute. Just one last comment. Do you have anything additional?    Mr. Calvert. Going back to what Ms. McCollum was saying when we were on the Navajo Reservation on that memorable bus ride. You would have thought with four senior members somebody would have got a motor grader out there and graded that road out to the school. Mr. Calvert. Or maybe they did that on purpose to send us a message, but it comes back to maintenance. The Navajo's reservation is, what, 17 million acres, and there are a lot of roads out there, a lot of dirt roads. I would assume that there is a crew of people that that is all they do is grade out these, because, it is impractical, I get it, to pave every road on the Navajo Reservation, for instance, or Pine Ridge, and some of these large reservations.    But you would certainly think they would have some kind of a maintenance program where they would, you know, have a motor grader go out on a normal maintenance schedule and maintain those roads because that is cost effective because the equipment would get blown up over a period of time, tires, everything else. Is that happening?                                         Wednesday, March 16, 2016.                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Mr. Calvert. So we are going to shift gears and focus on more detail on oversight of BIE facilities, condition, and management. I would like to welcome back our witness from the Government Accountability Office, Melissa Emrey-Arras, if I pronounced that correctly.    Mr. Calvert. Okay. Director of Education at GAO's Education, Workforce, and Security team. Thank you for being here today and for GAO's continued efforts to spotlight the Bureau of Indian Education, including agreeing just yesterday to another study that digs down even deeper into accountability issues we will be discussing today. No doubt that your work has raised awareness on both sides of Capitol Hill, and awareness helps make our job a little less difficult.    Three years ago in this room, then Chairman Simpson convened a similar BIE oversight hearing in which GAO testified prior to finalizing a study we asked it to do regarding per people spending. GAO's testimony at that time helped the subcommittee push this Administration to make Indian education a much higher priority than before.    To its credit clearly, the Administration has stepped up, but we still have a long way to go. And I recognize the funding can help close part of that distance, but not all of it. As we see today, there continue to be some management and accountability issues, and perhaps even some legislative issues that must be addressed before significant funding can follow.    Before we turn to our witness, let me allow first our distinguished ranking member, Ms. McCollum, for any opening remarks that she may like to make.                    Opening Remarks of Ms. McCollum    Mr. Calvert. And thank you. Ms. Emrey-Arras, you are welcome to address our committee today. Thank you.                   Opening Remarks of Ms. Emrey-Arras    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. I am going to ask some simple questions here and get this going.    Why is it important that the BIA inspect BIE schools annually?    Mr. Calvert. What effect has uneven workload distribution had on BIA safety inspections?    Mr. Calvert. In that view, were there any example schools that were not inspected during the past 4 Fiscal Years that were within driving distance of regional offices?    Mr. Calvert. What authority does Indian Affairs' safety office have over BIA regional safety inspectors?    Mr. Calvert. And this question, I guess, to cap it off. Is it reasonable to expect that every employee, having line authority over facility inspections also have 100 percent inspection rate criterion in his or her annual performance evaluation?    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Okay, Ms. Pingree, and then there was something I was going to clarify, but I will do it later. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. You pass? Okay. I just want to clarify one point from your testimony and from the questions. Indian Affairs is wrapping up a new construction list. Is that correct?    Mr. Calvert. Which is based on school condition, which is based on inspections, which are not getting done. Is that accurate?    Mr. Calvert. I think that we all should be concerned about culturally. If an institution is not doing its most basic responsibilities, this is a basic responsibility, school safety, what does that mean to the rest of the institution? I mean, that begs that question.    Mr. Calvert. No. Any other questions?    Mr. Calvert. Okay. I guess I have an additional question here my staff wants me to ask. GAO has built a significant body of work over the last 3 years on Indian education. Can you take a few minutes to recap or update us on some of your prior recommendations that are changing too slowly in your opinion?    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. This is disturbing. Ms. McCollum.                                           Tuesday, March 22, 2016.GINA McCARTHY, ADMINISTRATOR, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Mr. Calvert. Good morning. The committee will come to order.    Today, we are joined by Administrator Gina McCarthy and Acting Chief Financial Officer David Bloom to discuss EPA's fiscal year 2017 budget. Welcome to both of you.    First, we all woke up this morning to hear about the events in Brussels. It serves as a reminder that we must maintain our vigilance and remain united in our common goal of combating terrorism and fighting extremism. Certainly, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Belgium today.    Last year, the budget the President proposed ignored the spending caps that were then in place. As a result, it offered unrealistic expectations and created a challenge for agencies and departments to identify true needs. We need to start this discussion for the fiscal year 2017 budget on no better footing with a budget that seemingly abides by the bipartisan spending caps set forth in October, but half full of gimmicks.    Unfortunately, the President's budget has shifted billions of dollars from discretionary programs to the mandatory side of the ledger. This allows the administration to circumvent the budget constraints while touting support for key investments. Again, it offers unrealistic expectations about what we can afford.    On the Interior Subcommittee, we must balance a wealth of important issues--Indian health care, education, fighting wildfires, management of lands and resources, protection of human health and environment. When challenges arise from natural disasters, manmade disasters, health crises, rising debt, we need to be strategic and have well-defined plans for tackling the problems before us. Simply throwing money at problems has rarely resolved such issues.    It is our job to identify common-sense, long-term solutions and to prioritize all these issues without adding to our $19 trillion debt. Mandatory spending continues to rise faster than any portion of the Federal budget, something that they are discussing at this very moment. Therefore, a budget that proposes more mandatory spending is woefully out of touch.    In an effort to rebalance expectations, I would like to explain where we actually are. Under the current budget agreement, nondefense discretionary spending for fiscal year 2017 has increased by $40 million government-wide. That is $40 million over the entire discretionary government.    Meanwhile, the EPA proposed budget requests $127 million more than last year. That number excludes another $300 million proposed outside of the discretionary caps.    Within the budget, the agency is proposing to work on more regulations while proposing cuts for water infrastructure and Great Lakes funding. The budget proposes more funding to implement regulations the courts have put on hold.    Meanwhile, the budget again proposes deep cuts to the diesel emissions reduction grants, despite the fact that only 30 percent of trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles have transitioned to cleaner technologies. We need to follow the science and increase discretionary funding for the DERA program to accelerate the replacement of older engines with newer, cleaner engines that actually show progress.    With so much left to do, we are not prepared to cut discretionary funding for the DERA program by 80 percent, nor eliminate funding for radon grants when 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year are directly attributable to exposure to radon.    I hope in today's discussion you can help the committee understand why the administration does not place a higher priority on the radon exposure issue, given these startling statistics.    Turning to policy, it is unavoidably clear the administration is intent on making select forms of energy uneconomical or even obsolete. We have seen this play out in Chairman Rogers' district for the last 7 years, and certainly Mr. Jenkins' district, via refusal to approve permits to operate.    The policy continues to spread as the administration imposes a moratorium on operations on public lands; designates new monuments; precludes offshore energy development in the Atlantic and Arctic; adds costs to existing operations via EPA ozone, methane, and water regulations. And the White House, with one foot out the door, has promised to double-down on an antijobs agenda driven by a desire to keep it in the ground as the clock runs out on this administration.    In the meantime, statutory obligations are put on hold or given insufficient attention. It is time for a new perspective.    You have a tough job, Administrator McCarthy. We all want clean air and clean water and a strong, robust economy. It is not a Republican or Democratic issue. I know that is something we have often said. We both want a healthy environment and job creation, and we need a real debate regarding the best way to incentivize those outcomes rather than a rewrite of regulations.    But it starts by proposing and operating within a budget that lives within our means. The people I represent in California have to live on a budget that reflects what they can afford, and so too does the Federal Government.    I know all members are interested in discussing various issues with you today, so I will save my additional remarks for the period following your testimony.    I am pleased to yield to my friend and our distinguished ranking member, Ms. McCollum.                    Opening Remarks of Ms. McCollum    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. I learn something new every day. Was your mom a Republican?    Mr. Calvert. She voted for Richard Nixon.    Mr. Calvert. Well, one out of two is not bad.    I know Chairman Rogers would have loved to been here this morning, but we have a conference going on right now, and he has to be there. I would like to submit his full opening statement for the record.    Without objection.    Mr. Calvert. The ranking member is here this morning, Ms. Lowey, and I am happy to recognize her.    And her grandson is in attendance, so we are very proud to have him here.    Ms. Lowey, you are recognized for your opening statement.                      Opening Remarks of Ms. Lowey    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    I think it is a point well-made--excuse me. I should get to your opening statement, and then I will make my comments.    You are recognized, Ms. McCarthy.               Opening Remarks of Administrator McCarthy    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    A point was made about the bipartisan effort, and I think that is true, about the environment over the years. Obviously, EPA was signed into law by Republican President Richard Nixon. In my own home State, California, Cal EPA was signed into law by Ronald Reagan. We also created the South Coast Air District. Our former colleague, Jerry Lewis, wrote that legislation back when he was in the State Assembly. Of course, it was signed into law by then-Governor Ronald Reagan.    Now the Inland Empire, where I live, it is part of the South Coast air quality district and has been in nonattainment for ozone as about as long as the Federal standard for ozone has existed. As I am sure you know, it is not for lack of trying.    The South Coast Air District has a long history of implementing some of the most stringent air pollution measures in the country. We broke ground in many of these instances.    When I played football, I can remember in my early days, I could not see the goalposts on the other side of the field, because air quality was so bad. Today, that has totally changed, and yet the population has tripled in my area in Southern California.    Nearby, we have two of the busiest ports in the United States, the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, which are responsible for 40 percent of all U.S. container imports and exports. These containers are loaded onto trucks. They travel through my district and the rest of the country, so mobile sources contribute about 80 percent of the air pollution in the South Coast.    We have made significant progress in improving air quality, however, as I mentioned. But largely due to topography and the large volume of transportation that occurs in and around the Inland Empire, we need some additional resources to make improvements.    That is why the fiscal year 2015 omnibus renewed our Targeted Air Shed Grant program to provide additional resources to areas across the Nation that are similarly struggling to meet air quality standards and need additional help. The 2016 omnibus built on that by doubling those grants.    With EPA's latest ozone standard of 70 parts per billion, the South Coast air quality basin will invariably remain out of compliance. It also may cause other counties to fall out of attainment with air quality standards.    Unfortunately, I am struggling to understand why this budget, with all these increases elsewhere, cuts discretionary funding for DERA by 80 percent and also proposes to eliminate the Targeted Air Shed Grant program. These programs help communities work toward the 2008 ozone mandates.    Meanwhile, the budget proposes a $50 million increase for the Clean Power Plan, which, as you know, the courts have put on hold.    Can you explain that, Ms. McCarthy?    Mr. Calvert. It is one of the few times that Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer and I agree on anything, is the DERA program, which has been remarkable in its ability to improve especially particulate pollution in the South Coast basin, fine particulate pollution.    As you know, we are not going to be getting into mandatory spending. Realistically, that is not going to happen. So we are going to have to find money within the discretionary budget to do that.    With that, Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentlelady.    Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Stewart.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. Without objection.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Jenkins.    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentleman.    I guess the question is, are you planning on visiting West Virginia before the end of the year?    Mr. Calvert. It is a beautiful State to visit, by the way.    Next is Mr. Israel.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. I am sure we will be working together on that issue.    Next, Mr. Joyce.    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentleman.    Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. With that, I am happy to recognize our full committee chairman, Mr. Rogers.    Mr. Calvert. Thanks, Chairman.    Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Just a comment, and then I have a question. I have been charting the coal industry for some time. From the book value of those corporations, they have been driven to near zero. Bankruptcies, you obviously read about in the newspaper.    So if the administration plan was to destroy that industry, it appears that you have succeeded.    Mr. Calvert. Nothing like we have seen in the last number of years.    Mr. Calvert. I am going to change directions entirely and talk about pesticides.    Mr. Calvert. This may be something that may be going to the top of your to-do list, because of the numbers of problems that are coming to the United States.    I do not want to be an alarmist but obviously we know about the citrus industry in Florida and the psyllid issue. That is also moving across the country, including to my home State of California. We have already experienced the Pierce's disease, which has another insect, glassy-winged sharpshooter, which is the vector.    EPA had granted waivers in order for us to fight that disease, or the grape industry would have been crushed in the wrong way. And we would have had a devastating effect on our wine industry, and we need wine right now as a country to get through from day to day. Mr. Calvert. Lastly, and more seriously, now the Zika virus. The chairman and I were just recently in South America. We visited laboratories that are working on trying to get ahead of this problem. I think the chairman would agree we were very concerned after the briefings we received that the spread of this mosquito across certainly right now in Puerto Rico and moving into Florida, that there may be a need for pesticides to be used.    I know at some point you have to make decisions. You have to balance the health and welfare of the citizens versus maybe in some respects the environment, to fight this mosquito, which apparently is a very hard mosquito to kill.    I am sure you probably have had briefings on this already, but maybe you can share with us what activities EPA is involved in, whether they need to grant waivers to fight this. It seems like we have to get on this immediately.    Mr. Calvert. I appreciate the answer.    Next, Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. I think. Approximately.    Mr. Calvert. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. I do not disagree with Ms. Pingree. Obviously, if there are other alternatives to pesticides, I am all for it.    As a matter fact, in my own area at the University of California, we have I think the largest laboratory in the United States on beneficial insects. We in California have used those over 100 years to combat various types of insects.    But if there is a health emergency, we all here agree that we do not want that to happen, but sometimes decisions have to be made. I would hope that you plan for the worst-case scenarios as well as to be prepared if, in fact, we have to react quickly, because you may be in a situation here shortly where you have to. This may not be as bad a problem as we think, but it may be a lot worse than we think.    Mr. Calvert. Florida now, I think they have lost a third of their citrus throughout the State. The citrus industry believes they will be totally out of citrus business here, if this continues, in the next 5 years.    We have psyllid in California, but we do not yet have the disease associated with it, except in a very defined area, which we are trying to control.    So we are sometimes asking for those waivers to get in there and deal with this issue as rapidly as we can.    Mr. Calvert. I think it was Albert Einstein who once said, if you want to destroy the human race, destroy the bee population of the world, and it will all be over.    So I understand that we need to make sure that we do not do that.    Any additional questions?                                         Wednesday, March 23, 2016.                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Mr. Calvert. The committee will come to order.    Dr. Skorton, I would like to welcome you to today's hearing. We appreciate you joining us this morning to share your vision for the future of the Smithsonian and to discuss your budget priorities for fiscal year 2017.    The members and staff are also grateful that you have brought some interesting historical items for show and tell. It is always one of the highlights of our hearing season. You clearly have one of the most interesting jobs in town. I think most of us around this table would love to trade places with you, but something tells me it wouldn't be in the best interests of the Smithsonian. So we will all keep our jobs.    The Smithsonian's mission is to increase diffusion of knowledge. As the 13th Secretary of the Smithsonian, you are entrusted with the challenging responsibilities of operating and managing one of our country's most revered institutions. The Smithsonian is often referred to as America's attic, and no wonder. You are the steward of more than 138 million objects, and the national collection reflects America's artistic, cultural, and scientific heritage.    The Smithsonian provides education and outreach programs in art, culture, history, and science for visitors and scholars alike. It is governed by a board of regents consisting of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Vice President, nine private citizens, and six Members of Congress, including our good friend Tom Cole, who serves on this subcommittee.    Overall, the proposed funding level in the Smithsonian's fiscal year 2017 budget request is $922.2 million, which is $82 million, or about 10 percent, above fiscal year 2016 enacted level. Compared with other major accounts under this subcommittee's jurisdiction, your request is one of the most ambitious as measured on a percentage basis.    Like most big organizations, the Smithsonian faces some enormous challenges, which we will be discussing at some length today. The subcommittee recently learned of the need for enormously costly repairs to the National Air and Space Museum. If approved, this effort will place extraordinary burdens on the Smithsonian's annual budget for the foreseeable future.    The subcommittee congratulates the Smithsonian on the news of the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture on September 24 this year. The committee has met its funding commitment, providing $270 million, or one-half the total cost toward construction of the museum. We are pleased that this extraordinary public-private partnership, enabling the museum to be built, has proven successful and the construction is now nearly complete.    The construction of the African American Museum and the proposed repairs of the National Air and Space Museum are illustrative of the very real challenges this subcommittee faces. There is both increasing demand for and shrinking supply of Federal dollars to address many legitimate priorities. For this reason, it is essential that the Smithsonian outline and clearly communicate its highest and greatest priorities.    Every member of this subcommittee would like to support a 10 percent increase for funding for the Smithsonian, but given the incredible demands across this bill, it is probably not realistic. Difficult funding decisions will have to be made. The subcommittee will do its very best to address the Smithsonian's most urgent priorities. I look forward to your testimony and continuing to work together.    In closing, I want to commend you for the Smithsonian's efforts to improve the display and storage of your vast collections. Based on the input this committee receives from Members from both sides of the aisle, it is very clear that the preservation and the care of these priceless and irreplaceable collections remain a high priority of this committee and this Congress.    I am now happy to yield to my good friend and the subcommittee's ranking member, Ms. McCollum, for any opening remarks she would like to make.                    Opening Remarks of Ms. McCollum    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Dr. Skorton, I am happy to yield to you for your opening statement. You are recognized.                     Opening Remarks of Dr. Skorton    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Doctor.    As you mentioned in your opening statement, the National Air and Space Museum, which is the most visited museum in the United States and second most visited in the world behind only the Louvre in Paris, is in need of some major repair work. The projections I have seen project the total cost to be extraordinary, nearly $600 million. This amount exceeds the total cost of the new Museum of African American History and Culture.    Can you explain in some detail the nature of the repairs needed and why the estimated cost to address them is so high?    Mr. Calvert. I am going to ask this question, because if I don't, somebody's going to ask me, ``Why didn't you ask it? '' What would be the replacement cost to just tear the existing museum down and rebuild it?    Mr. Calvert. Sure. And of the $600 million, how much do you anticipate would be funded through Federal appropriations and how much would be addressed through non-Federal funding sources?    Mr. Calvert. Well, before I ask Ms. McCollum to take over and ask a few questions, why don't you explain some of the items that you brought here to show us and to show everyone.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Calvert. Well, since we have the portrait of Abraham Lincoln here, who wisely designated Yosemite to be the first federally acquired eventual park, that was very wise of him.    Mr. Calvert. We have a private joke going.    Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Joyce.    Mr. Calvert. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you very much.    Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Israel.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    And we would love to spend the day with you, Doctor, but, unfortunately, we have to go vote.    Mr. Calvert. Saved by the bell.    I would like to get into more depth, somewhere down the road I will visit the Air and Space Museum with you, because that is a huge number, as you know, and we need to find out how we are going to do this. I know it has to be done, it is your most visited museum and it is certainly a national treasure.    With that, we are adjourned.
