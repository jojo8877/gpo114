    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you very much.    It is great to have everybody here. What an interesting series we have had. And as I really grasp technology when I was in grad school in the mid-1990s, not even that long ago, and it just really disrupted the typewriter and the calculator industry because we did the same thing that they were already doing, just did it more efficient. I think also it disrupted the wite-out industry, when I got to go on a word processor, didn't have to use it anymore. But it really just already took what we were doing and just made it better.    And what is happening now is you are actually taking this technology and just doing things we could never do before. It is amazing in the body parts and the replacement, you couldn't do those vertebra probably in any other type of manufacture.    I have a manufacturing background, and we take blocks of steel and make dyes out of it. We whittle it down, for lack of a better term. That is actually what we do, just computer-controlled machines. We are now creating stuff by printing it. By being additive, I hope it doesn't replace what we do, but it certainly enhances the precision of what you can do in specific things. So it is fascinating to be here.    I am going focus with UPS. Their Worldport is just outside of my district. But a lot of your employees and a lot of your customers are in my district, Zappos shoes, Bestbuy.com, and Geek Squad, which is a pretty interesting place to go. They don't have a plant manager. They have a mayor. And they don't have community leaders. They have ambassadors. So it is just an interesting business concept, but great, great people to be around.    But a lot of it is based on supply chain. I know a lot of us think of UPS as--and you said it in kind of your opening statement--the brown trucks and the airplanes that are flying in and out of Louisville. But I am more interested in what UPS really does. You talked about it a little bit. I would just give you some time to elaborate on how UPS actually helps small businesses with supply chain management to build their businesses and how 3D printing is a big part of that mission.    Mr. Guthrie. I have just about a minute. I just want to ask you a couple of more questions.    Mr. Guthrie. I will ask them both and then let you answer.    So where do you see the most demand for 3D printing today and where do you see it in 3 to 5 years? And what policies should we consider, what are important for us to consider as you see the demand for 3D printing and where it is going? And what can Congress do to help or not help--or get out of way, I guess?    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. Yield back.
