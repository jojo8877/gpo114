    Mr. Mullin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you for being here again. I know we have spoken on several different occasions.    And, you know, you come today asking for a significant increase at a time when we are still running deficits across the country. Can you just give me your number-one priority, what you would use the money for?    Mr. Mullin. No. The number-one thing, what are you looking for, the number-one----    Mr. Mullin. Is that across the board, or is that just with renewables?    Mr. Mullin. Because the policy in the past that your administration has put forth, and your agency, isn't across the board. It is not equally yoked. It seems to have a tendency to lean towards renewables.    And with that being said, I have another question for you. DOE is charged with setting effective and comprehensive national energy policy. Is that correct?    Mr. Mullin. Sort of?    Mr. Mullin. I mean, I thought that was the reason why it was in existence to begin with.    Mr. Mullin. Well, it is not ``sort of.'' It is either ``yes'' or ``no.''    Mr. Mullin. No, I am talking--I don't care about the energy review. I am talking about DOE is charged with setting effective and comprehensive national energy policy. Is that a yes or a no?    Mr. Mullin. It is just a simple ``yes'' or ``no.''    Mr. Mullin. I don't need an explanation. I just need a ``yes'' or ``no.''    Mr. Mullin. Just a ``yes'' or ``no,'' sir.    Mr. Mullin. I am not asking for a long answer. I just want a ``yes'' or ``no.''    Mr. Mullin. The shortest one would be ``yes'' or ``no.'' It is either a three-letter word or a two-letter word.    Mr. Mullin. Now, sir, I just want a simple ``yes'' or ``no.''    Mr. Mullin. So is that a----    Mr. Mullin . ``Yes''? Why didn't you just say that to begin with?    Mr. Mullin. No, it didn't need anything else. All I needed was a ``yes'' or ``no.''    So is part of that about the affordable and reliability of our energy policy?    Mr. Mullin. Is part of that policy about the affordable and the reliability to our taxpayers, to the American people?    Mr. Mullin. Then why are we allowing----    Mr. Mullin. Then why are we allowing the EPA to set agenda for DOE?    Mr. Mullin. Clean Power Plan? Is that not going to affect affordable and reliability issues?    Mr. Mullin. No, it is not. What we are doing is you are allowing agencies to----    Mr. Mullin. We all want to be good stewards, but what I have an issue with is when the EPA becomes able to set policy for the DOE and when DOE becomes a source of agenda-driven issues rather than really focusing on making sure that we have reliable and effective, efficient energy sources to the American people. And when we start looking at only one factor, such as green renewables, which is an agenda-driven policy, and we take a look away from what has driven this economy and our energy resilience, I have an issue with that.    And we want the Department of Energy to be successful because we want America to be successful, but we don't want it to be agenda-driven. And we are allowing the EPA step all over your agenda or your policies by setting policies through the Clean Power--and I don't see any pushback from you or your agency saying, ``Wait, this is part of ours too. You are affecting us.'' Instead, you are just going along to get along.    That is from my perspective. Now, if you can tell me something different, please let me know.    Mr. Mullin. What if it affects the reliability of it?    Mr. Mullin. What if it affects the reliability?    I don't know who you keep looking to over there, but you and I are the ones talking here.    So what if it affects the reliability of it?    Mr. Mullin. Do you not see the Clean Power Plan being a reliability issue if it goes into full effect?    Mr. Mullin. That is very hard to believe.    Mr. Mullin. I appreciate it.    I yield back.
