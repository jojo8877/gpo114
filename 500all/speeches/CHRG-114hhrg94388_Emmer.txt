    Mr. Emmer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this important hearing. As a co-sponsor of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, I feel it is important and necessary for us to hold human rights abusers accountable, and I appreciate the opportunity to be part of this hearing. Those who abuse human rights must face serious consequences, and this hearing, along with the Accountability Act, will strengthen the President's ability to sanction human rights abusers.    I look forward to hearing from our panel of witnesses, and, again, thank you, Mr. Chairman and the ranking member, for holding this important hearing, and I yield back.
