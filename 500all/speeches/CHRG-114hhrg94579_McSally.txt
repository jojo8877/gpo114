    Ms. McSally. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I appreciate it.    Ms. McSally. Dr. Frey, to follow up on the previous question, you mentioned that the administration has not reported the visa overstay numbers for a variety of different reasons. Could you go through some of those reasons?    Ms. McSally. You may be more free to----    Ms. McSally. Other perspectives? Any other----    Ms. McSally. Great. Thank you.    Ms. McSally. Great. Thanks. Turning to another question on--I know there has been expanded data collected from those that are applying. Do you think that is enough? I mean, it is still less than 20 questions versus somebody who has an in-person interview is about 100 questions. Do we need to expand? What sort of additional data would be required if we wanted to do that?    Ms. McSally. Okay. Great. My time is expired. So if you just have a brief comment.    Ms. McSally. Great. Thank you.    Thank you, Madam Chairman. I yield back.
