    Mr. Neugebauer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for holding this hearing.    Mr. Arougheti, Mr. Brown had said that increasing the leverage ratio would be harmful to--has the potential to be harmful to the investors. But what I heard you saying is that you would use that leverage in a way that enhances shareholder value, wouldn't you?    Mr. Neugebauer. So, if this bill passes and becomes law, you don't see this big rush out to all these companies to leverage up because basically it is going to--you have a business model and there is certain amount of opportunity out there to determine how you can best fund that.    Mr. Neugebauer. So do you see this, the growing of the BDC market increasing as the--as we see the diminished participation in the banking community?    Mr. Neugebauer. And from the panel--these are some thoughtful ideas--are there other things in that space that we need to be thinking about that is under-addressed in this legislation that would encourage the BDC activity and help--more importantly help small businesses access capital?    Mr. Foster, you look like you--    Mr. Neugebauer. Mr. Quaadman?    Mr. Neugebauer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
