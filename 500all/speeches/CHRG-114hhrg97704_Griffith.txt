    Mr. Griffith. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I will try to be quick.    Mr. Jaffe, you indicated in one of the answers earlier that you didn't--and correct me if I got it wrong--that you didn't see any concerns today about allergens, that none of the foods that are out there now that have been genetically engineered have allergen problems, but you were concerned about the future.    Can you get me information on that, if I got that information correct from you originally? Was that correct, what I thought I heard you say?    Mr. Griffith. Can you get me some information after the hearing in regard to concerns or papers about concerns about future allergens? As a father of a 9-year-old who has a lot of food allergies, I would be interested in that. Would you do that for me?    Mr. Griffith. And, Mr. Daloz, industry is concerned about potential for private actions against manufacturers. Under your law, I believe the law is maybe unclear on that point.    Does Vermont's law block private rights of action against manufacturers and suppliers? I am not going to ask you for an answer today because we are short on time. I am going to ask you if you would get us something on that.    And if the answer is no, what do you intend to do to limit liability when a product, the person who manufactured it really didn't intend for it to ever end up in Vermont but somebody puts it on the shelf there anyway?    And if you could get me an answer to that at a later date, I would greatly appreciate it. I am trying to make sure that Mr. Pompeo gets an opportunity.    Thank you, gentlemen.    And, with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
