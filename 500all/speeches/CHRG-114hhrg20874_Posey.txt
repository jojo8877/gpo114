    Mr. Posey. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Posey. Okay. But just on a practical basis, you know, somebody walks into a retail store without the owner's permission and steals 160,000 items, the store owner comes back and figures out somebody stole this, went to them, they say, oh, okay, well, I'll give you back these particular items is all I'm going to admit that I accidentally took from your store. That doesn't eliminate the fact that there was a theft from the store just because they gave back at least some of the items that they illegally took. Do you see any similarity to the example I'm drawing and what happened here?    Mr. Posey. Have you exhausted the questioning of the people involved? Have they voluntarily come forth? Do you need to depose them? Are you in a position to--you could depose them and ask the kind of questions you'd like to see answers to and I'd like to see answers to?    Mr. Posey. Thank you for your frank answers. I see my time is up. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
