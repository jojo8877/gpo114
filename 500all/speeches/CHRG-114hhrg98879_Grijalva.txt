    Mr. Grijalva. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will enter my full statement into the record, if there is no objection.    The Chairman. Can I stop you if there is an objection?    Mr. Grijalva. If you want to hear it, I would be more than glad to----    The Chairman. No objection.    Mr. Grijalva. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. Weiss. I want to thank you for a very comprehensive written statement. It answered many questions that have been raised about the proposal you outlined in your oral testimony.    That being said, I have one remaining question. What is your plan B? How do we plan on averting a humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico that you warn of, if your efforts to get Congress to act do not pan out? Is there a plan B?    Mr. Grijalva. Mr. Weiss, it has been suggested that bankruptcy for Puerto Rico is a huge mistake, that what the island needs is to reduce spending and simply repay its obligation. How does Treasury feel about that assessment? Do you agree, as others have suggested, that granting bankruptcy or restructuring authority to Puerto Rico would be changing the rules in the middle of the game, two issues that have come up previously?    Mr. Grijalva. Yes.    Mr. Grijalva. So, essentially, for Puerto Rico to survive and begin a renewal of their economy and deal with the action on those two areas, the oversight and the restructuring by Congress, mandated by Congress, is essential in moving forward in any way. Is that the gist of everything?    Mr. Grijalva. Thank you.    The Chairman. Thank you.
