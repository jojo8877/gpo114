    Mr. Loebsack. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I really just want to come back to one issue that was already brought up, and have you elaborate a little bit on that, Mr. Wheeler. But before I actually ask that specific question, I always just like to talk about rural broadband, as you might imagine, both of you, and just how important it is for places like Iowa, but not just places like Iowa, just all over the country. And I know we have bipartisan support to make sure that we have rules in place, make sure that we have programs in place, incentives in place, to expand that broadband availability to so many folks around the country.    We know it is an economic development issue. We know it is a health issue when we talk about the spectrum, for example, issue for hospitals, making sure that--I heard from someone this morning about that, making sure that they have the broadband available, and makingsure that they can do what they need to do for their patients.    We know it is important for education. I often talk about the University of Iowa, how they have a program where they offer AP classes, but it doesn't do any good in those rural areas if those folks cannot access what the University of Iowa offers. And we know that farmers, it is very, very important for farmers to be able to have access to broadband so they can make decisions, obviously, for planting, and for their businesses in general, and on and on and on. I was in Centreville, Iowa for one of my 24 town hall meetings on broadband--small town, and there were 27 people at that meeting on a weekday afternoon at 2:00 in the afternoon because it is just so absolutely critical for them to be able to have this broadband coverage.    So really my question goes back to what I think was already mentioned. You know, earlier this year 115 members, myself included, wrote to you, Chairman Wheeler, urging reform of the portion of the high cost program that supports small rural broadband providers so that they could receive USF support for lines, over which customers opted to purchase only broadband, rather than traditional voice service, as is the current practice. The rural broadband industry submitted a data-only broadband reform plan to the FCC in 2013, but the FCC has not yet acted on this plan. Are there issues with the reform plan specifically proposed by the Rural Broadband Industry that prevent the FCC from acting on it as proposed? And if you could just elaborate on that, I would appreciate it.    Mr. Loebsack. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Wheeler. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I yield back.
