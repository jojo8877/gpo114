    Ms. Harvey. Good morning. My name is Eleanor Harvey. I am the senior curator of 19th century art at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. And as a former geologist, as well as an art historian, I bring to you today Thomas Moran's watercolor of Excelsior Geyser in Yellowstone painted in 1873, the year after Congress in its wisdom set aside Yellowstone as America's first national park.    The park behind you, Yosemite, was set aside by Abraham Lincoln as a protected preserve at the middle of the Civil War as a post-war sanctuary, recognizing the power of nature as something we hold dear as part of America's cultural infrastructure.    This watercolor was reproduced, along with a suite of others, to help promote visitorship to Yellowstone. I also see the See America proposals from the WPA. They were based on a Northern Pacific Railroad campaign called See Europe, But See America First. In order to get people out to places like Yellowstone, they created both the railroads and the infrastructure so that you could go watch Old Faithful and Excelsior Geyser erupt in full display.    So it was a patriotic moment in America when we recognized that we have such unique features in this country that actually instill a kind of civic pride and make people want to explore the vastness of the country that we have here.
