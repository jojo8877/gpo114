    Mr. Takai. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Bruno, United Launch Alliance has a very impressive launch success, and I just wanted to thank you and your employees and commend you for this success.    This hearing concerns the matter of assured access to space, and the national policy in law requires two separate vehicle systems that can execute 100 percent of the national security launch requirements.    What do you suggest we do to fulfill this legal requirement?    Mr. Takai. Thank you.    Ms. Shotwell, SpaceX has said that it can provide launches for DOD payloads at about 75 percent price reduction--I heard a little bit different reduction today--from what is currently being charged, on the average, per flight.    How have you been able to achieve this savings?    Mr. Takai. What is the correct percentage? I have been hearing----    Mr. Takai. Compared to the----    Mr. Takai. Your competitor.    Mr. Takai. Yes.    Mr. Takai. Okay. So my question is: How are you able to achieve that type of savings?    Mr. Takai. Okay. And for my final question, you note in your statement that SpaceX designs and builds all of its own rockets in California, yet most of the other rocket engines that currently support other rockets are built in other countries, say, Russia.    Why did you choose to make your engines in the United States? And what are some of the national security advantages of an all-American supply chain?
