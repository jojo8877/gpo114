    Mr. Gibbs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Conner, Boeing--I am over here--I want to commend you for--it is really exciting to hear about the increase of employment and planes you are building and new orders. That is exciting. And I want to kind of follow through a little bit on Mr. Hanna's questions about foreign competition and the regulatory structure. And I realize we have agreements with them and the FAA, and I am sure the airlines get involved.    And then, also, Mr. Hilkemann, on your written testimony, it kind of comes together a little bit. In your written testimony, you say there is frequent and redundant surveillance activities, many of which are conducted by foreign aviation authorities, duplicate similar efforts while producing low, additional value. And some of it is done by foreign authorities.    So I am trying to--you know, I think, Mr. Conner, you said that the bureaucracy sometimes, you know, takes longer, than what maybe it takes some of your foreign competitors.    And, Mr. Hilkemann, having run the largest maintenance, repair, and overhaul business in the United States, in this regard, you know, how level is the playing field? Or would you say the foreigners come in and cause the most problems? And see where I am going here. Can you kind of expound on what our challenges are to get our efficiencies in place so Mr. Conner can be competitive selling airplanes?    Mr. Gibbs. Just to follow through with Mr. Conner then, would our American Airlines customers have the ability to go do that on foreign competition, airplane manufacturers like Mr. Hilkemann just kind of described?    Mr. Gibbs. I think you also mentioned the Chinese are getting into the airplane export.    Mr. Gibbs. They haven't delivered, but the process is being started, just from a safety aspect, since their planes, you know, would theoretically be flying over our skies----    Mr. Gibbs. We will have to have--the FAA, United States Government--will have an agreement with them?    Mr. Gibbs. It would be similar to what you have, I assume, with the French Government.    Mr. Gibbs. OK. So I guess, you know, since we are looking at another FAA reauthorization, obviously, this is an issue that you are concerned about for the efficiency, so I assume you have probably got some more information you might want to share or----    Mr. Gibbs. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
