    Mr. Beyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Gerstenmaier, on the one hand we've had the three unfortunate losses that have been previously mentioned. On the other hand, it seems that our commercial space industry is getting ready to grow exponentially, adding great value to our economy and our civilization of the new satellites, internet, space tours of even Mars are talked about.    Can you help us put these accidents in the proper perspective, especially compared to train and airline and automobile accidents, 30,000 deaths last year, by the way, NASA tragedies and all the transportation accidents in history? Are we looking at the relatively two or three that have come up in the right perspective compared to the last 150 years?    Mr. Beyer. Well, thank you for your positive and your optimistic attitude which I very much appreciate.    While you have the microphone though, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, ASAP, has identified micro-meteoroid and orbital debris as a top safety risk facing ISS. How does NASA address these concerns about orbital debris?    Mr. Beyer. All right. Thank you very much. Dr. Pawelczyk, you testified that during the 2000s, it resulted in NASA's priorities that the life, space life, and physical sciences were particularly hard hit, and a lot of scientists actually left the field. Do you have any concerns about the level of the workforce and expertise in that field today, especially as we get ready to think about man's missions to Mars?    Mr. Beyer. That's great, and thank you for your enthusiasm. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
