    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for this hearing, and I thank Rear Admiral Schultz and Vice Admiral Michel for their presence here today. As the Representative from Florida's southernmost district, I have a very special appreciation for the Coast Guard and its mission. Thank you for keeping our people safe and secure.    I am hoping you can address generally this phenomenon we are seeing of drug transit routes shifting to the Caribbean. Have you seen a spike in the past several years and what impact has this had on your budget?    Mr. Curbelo. Yeah that is right.    Mr. Curbelo. Since you mentioned Cuba, and with the chairman's dispensation because it doesn't have to deal specifically with drug trafficking, but we have seen a spike in migrant movement from Cuba to the United States. Do you attribute that to something specifically, and do you feel that you are prepared at this time for a potential mass migration of them?    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you both. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
