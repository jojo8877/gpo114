    Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I want to thank the witnesses for being here, and particularly I want to welcome Dr. Ochoa from Arkansas Children's Hospital.    I am one of those families in Arkansas who has seen personally, up close and personal, the benefits of Arkansas Children's Hospital. It is a world-class institution and doing great work there, and I thank you for that.    You mentioned some statistics in your testimony, Dr. Ochoa, about Arkansas in particular being the second highest rate in the United States in terms of food insecurity, and I find that to be a little bit ironic considering we are one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country, if not the world. And so I say that to say this: we tend to look at these problems a lot of times through the lens of our own district, but with the statistics that we have in east Arkansas, which is my district, and the Mississippi Delta, if we can get this issue right there we can apply that anywhere, and create a template to really effectively address this food insecurity issue.    Let me ask what specifically the Arkansas Children's Hospital is doing and the work you are doing in the region, how are you tackling food insecurity in the Delta, and can you expand on the role of public-private partnerships to help assist in those challenges?    Mr. Crawford. Thank you. I know there has been a lot of mention about breaking the cycle of poverty. Madam Chair, you mentioned that as a question you received in a meeting in your district.    Dr. Ochoa, based on your experience in the Delta, what do you think needs to be done to support children who want to break the cycle of poverty, how do we do it?    Mr. Crawford. Thank you.    I yield back.    The Chairwoman. The chair recognizes Ms. Adams, for 5 minutes.
