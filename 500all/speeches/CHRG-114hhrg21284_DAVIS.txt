    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, let me thank you and the ranking member for calling this hearing.    You know, I grew up during an era when people put a great deal of emphasis on the notion that an ounce of prevention was worth much more than a pound of cure and that, if you could prevent things from happening, then, of course, you would experience the benefit of that.    Mr. O'Carroll and Mr. Bertoni, both of you have been engaged in this effort to ferret out what we call waste, fraud, and abuse for quite some time.    In your experiences, what have you found the most? Has it been waste? Has it been fraud? Has it been abuse that you could just categorize?    Mr. DAVIS. Mr. Eysink, I am going to ask you. What has been the most effective in the State of Louisiana in your experiences?    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. My time has expired. So I yield back.
