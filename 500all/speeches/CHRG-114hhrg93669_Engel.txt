    Mr. Engel. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for calling this very timely and important hearing. At the outset I want to acknowledge the Ukrainian Days participants who are in the audience today.    And Ambassador Nuland, welcome back. We thank you for testifying today. We thank you for your decades of service. And on a personal basis, let me also say that I have had to pleasure of working with you and I am a fan of your hard work, knowledge and tenacity. Thank you for all you do.    In Ukraine, the events of the past year and the ongoing Russian aggression threatens the security and stability of the entire region and undermines decades of American commitment to and investment in a Europe that is whole, free and at peace. In fact this is a threat to the whole international order.    So today we face grave questions. What can and should be done, and who should contribute to solving this problem? The United States is providing substantial assistance to the Government of Ukraine including billions of dollars in loan guarantees and non-lethal military aid. We have also imposed significant sanctions on Russia. We have sanctioned officials supporting Russia's aggression in Ukraine and targeted key sectors of the Russian economy. And we have seen results. Russia's economy has been taking on water, and this has only been magnified by the recent dip in oil prices.    These policies are good, but only up to a point. They don't go far enough, in my opinion. Russia's military gains in Ukraine have slowed, but Putin continues to grab land along the line of contact in violation of the Minsk ceasefire agreement, which mandates that Russian supported rebels pull back their forces.    The government in Kyiv is committed to reform, but leaders there struggle every day to preserve Ukrainian sovereignty. And while our financial assistance has kept Ukraine's economy afloat, they still confront a bleak economic outlook and the risks of a financial meltdown loom large.    Now when Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal in 1994, the United States made a commitment to help protect Ukrainian territorial integrity. That commitment was also made by Russia, U.K., China, other countries as well, but now our commitment is being tested. Let me also say that I think NATO made a grave mistake in 2008 when it refused to admit Ukraine and Georgia into NATO. I know that Germany and France resisted. The United States tried to push it. I didn't work. And I think we are paying the price today. I don't think that Putin would have been as aggressive if Ukraine was a part of NATO.    So last month I met with President Poroshenko. Met with him in Europe. His request was simple. Provide Ukraine with key weapons and military technology to defend itself. Specifically, Ukraine needs light anti-tank missiles to protect itself against rebels attacking with heavy, Russian supplied armor, not to evict the thousands of Russian troops inside Ukrainian borders. Ukraine needs longer range counter-battery radars to pinpoint attacking artillery and tanks, not to win a protracted war against Russia's military. And Ukraine needs better communications technology to deal with Russian efforts to jam their signals, not to advance on Moscow.    I was laughing when at that conference in Munich, Madam Secretary, you and I both attended, to hear the Russian Foreign Minister denying that Russian troops were in Ukraine, saying it was just Ukrainian rebels. Lies, lies and more lies.    I have spoken on the House floor calling on our Government to supply defensive weapons to Ukraine.    So Mr. Chairman, and I know you agree with me, Ukraine is not going to win a war against Russia, but it can impose a greater cost on Vladimir Putin's aggression and slow Russia's advances. And it has a chance to remain on its feet when all is said and done if it can impose a greater cost on Putin's aggression and slow Russia's advances.    Yet for nearly a year, the administration along with the vast majority of our European allies has resisted providing such assistance. Now to be sure, there are risks involved but there are also risks in allowing Putin to continue his aggression in Ukraine and to threaten other peaceful neighbors on Russia's periphery. And if Russia's aggressive pressure on the West reach the frontiers of our NATO allies, the dangers to Europe increase tremendously; the dangers to the NATO alliance increase tremendously.    In December, Congress unanimously passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act. This legislation authorized the provision of lethal defensive aid. I was proud to lead House efforts to pass this legislation and happy that President Obama signed it. But I have been disappointed that the administration has not used any of the tools provided in this law.    It is time to ask the hard question. Are we willing to stand up to Vladimir Putin's aggression before he kills more people, does more economic damage, further destabilizes Europe and threatens our NATO allies? Or are the risks just so great that we will simply cut our losses? As time passes, our options grow fewer and less effective. That is why I am announcing today my plan to introduce new legislation. It will offer Ukraine greater assistance on a variety of fronts. It will dial up the pressure on Vladimir Putin for his reckless, destructive and destabilizing policies, and it will send a clear message that the United States stands with the people of Ukraine against Russian aggression. I look forward to working with Chairman Royce and other colleagues as we move ahead with this effort.    And finally, let me just add that our European allies need to confront these same questions of strategy and political will. In my view, wealthy countries such as Germany, France and others have a lot more skin in the game economically and strategically. They should be doing more to assist Ukraine on the economic front as they seem even less willing than we are to provide needed military assistance. They should double down, dig deep, and ensure Ukraine does not endure a financial meltdown. This would be a win-win, keeping Ukraine solvent and preventing an even greater catastrophe on the EU's borders. The people of Ukraine are watching, the government in Kyiv is watching, and the whole world is watching. We cannot sit idly by and allow Putin to continue his aggression.    So again Ambassador Nuland, thank you for appearing here today and I look forward to your testimony.    Mr. Engel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Madam Secretary, let me also put my weight behind what our chairman has said. I agree with every word he said. I want to read you the first part of a report put out by Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty yesterday, and I would like you to comment on it.Edited per article deg.          ``U.S. Commander Says Some 12,000 Russian Soldiers In         Eastern Ukraine. The U.S. military estimates some         12,000 Russian soldiers are supporting pro-Moscow         separatists in eastern Ukraine. U.S. Army Europe         Commander Ben Hodges said the Russian forces are made         up of military advisers, weapons operators and combat         troops. Hodges also said some 29,000 Russian troops are         in Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine last year.          ``Hodges said in Berlin on March 3 that helping         Ukraine with weapons would increase the stakes for         Russian President Vladimir Putin at home. He added that         `when mothers start seeing sons come home dead, when         that price goes up, then that domestic support begins to shrink.' Hodges said what Ukraine         wants `is intelligence, counterfire capability and         something that can stop a Russian tank.'          ``The White House still hasn't decided whether to         send arms to Ukraine, and Hodges reiterated Washington         wanted a diplomatic solution. Hodges also said U.S.         plans to train three Ukrainian battalions have been put         on hold to see if a cease-fire deal forged last month         in the Belarusian capital Minsk will be fully         implemented. General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the         U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, also voiced support for         arming Ukraine on March 3.          ``Speaking before the Senate Armed Services         Committee, Dempsey said Washington `should absolutely         consider' providing Kyiv with arms through NATO.         Dempsey said Putin's ultimate goal was to fracture And I would add to that to destabilize Ukraine.        "Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama and European         leaders have agreed that a `strong reaction' would be         necessary if the Minsk cease-fire agreement is         violated.''    It is almost like when I was a little boy, and Gary Ackerman used to tell this story too. That his mother would tell him to do something and she would say, I am going to count to three and you better have this done when it is three. And she would go one, two, and then two and a quarter, two and a half, two and three quarters, and she would give it more and more time.    That seems to me what we are doing. We are so waiting and hoping that things happen that Putin, really, in my opinion, just looks at this as a sign of weakness. And I think the strongest thing that we can do now is to provide Kyiv with defensive lethal weapons.    Ambassador Nuland. Well, thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. Obviously this hearing gives us an opportunity for all of you on both sides of the aisle to register your views on this important subject. I would say as I said in my testimony that we are watching very intensively whether or not the Minsk agreements are implemented.    I cited some concerns already today following on the vicious taking of Debal'tseve. And, as I said, we have other tools in our arsenal including deepening of the sectoral sanctions and we are in consultation with our allies now on how that would go if we see more violations.    Mr. Engel. In your written testimony, Ambassador, in your written statement you mentioned, and I am quoting you, ``In the coming days, not weeks or months, we need to see full, unfettered access to the whole conflict zone including all separatist held territory for OSCE monitors.'' Does this include territory along the border with Russia and will we press for OSCE's ability to inspect the so-called humanitarian convoys regularly entering Ukraine from Russia?    Ambassador Nuland. We have been pressing for that in particular at the two border posts that OSCE has been able to monitor on the border. Unfortunately, these convoys seem to find roads ten kilometers north or ten kilometers south of where the OSCE monitors are and just wing right by.    But yes, the Minsk implementation agreement of February 12th calls in the first instance for monitoring and verification of ceasefire along the internal line as well as these pullbacks of heavy weapons. What is required by the agreement is not simply to see tanks and artillery pieces on roads moving back but to be able to count them; to be able to see them in permanent storage; to be able to come back on a regular basis to ensure that they haven't moved or been redeployed elsewhere; but also eventually to be able to have access to the entire special status area. And that will certainly be necessary if the political pieces of Minsk are to be implemented, new elections, et cetera, so that we can be sure that they are free and fair and that ODIHR and other OSCE elements can get in.    Mr. Engel. And let me just ask you one final question. I am really concerned that the Minsk implementation agreement does not provide Ukraine control over its own border with Russia until the end of this year following Constitution reform in Ukraine that is acceptable to Russia. Can you allay my fears and help me to make sense of this?    Ambassador Nuland. Well, you are correct, Mr. Ranking Member, that the way the implementation agreement was sequenced on February 12th restoring Ukrainian sovereignty on the eastern border is the last item and it doesn't happen until the end of 2015. But, as I said in my statement, we are also firm with our allies and partners that that means we will not be rolling back sanctions on Russia until Minsk is fully implemented. So that is part of what we have.    Now the Ukrainians, as you know, are in the process of working intensively to reform the Constitution. The Rada has taken new steps to accelerate that work including this bill that I mentioned to provide greater powers to the regions, even in advance, to all the regions of Ukraine even in advance of constitutional reform. So we are cautiously optimistic that with European and U.S. help, there will be constitutional reform in Ukraine in 2015 that will meet the standards and we will see whether the separatists are willing to work with the government and whether we actually have elections and new eastern Ukrainian authorities who can work on decentralization there.    Mr. Engel. Well, thank you. I think you hear my frustrations, the chairman's frustrations, but thank you personally for your hard work and your good work. Thank you.
