    Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Risenhoover, just one basic question here. We heard a lot of talk about using the science involved. Basically what I am wondering is why, if the states have better data on fish counts, fish harvest--it does not seem that scientific, it seems like they have the stats, from my understanding, available to them that have pretty accurate counts, much more within range than what we are hearing from what NOAA's numbers are.    So, why wouldn't we move more toward using that more accurate information, and basing harvests off of that and the other policies?    Mr. LaMalfa. But actually using it, though, for the----    Mr. LaMalfa. But, sir, if yours are maybe as much as 70 percent different from the states, with their more accurate system of actually tracking at the docks what the harvest is, how can you calibrate together something that is that far off?    Mr. LaMalfa. But, indeed, if the methodology for the state-based survey is already an improved, accurate one versus the NOAA one that is not, I do not know why they have to recalibrate the state-level ones.    Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, would you mind if I yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Graves?    Mr. LaMalfa. OK, all right. Thank you, I yield back.
