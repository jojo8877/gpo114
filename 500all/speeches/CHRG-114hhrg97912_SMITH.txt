    Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. McCorkle, it is a pleasure to hear your testimony earlier, and I just thought it was very troubling, whenever you look at the journey and the path that you had to take, but it shows that you are a remarkable human being and you are doing an amazing job, and I am extremely proud of you, to see everything.    When I look at your testimony, that it talks about the child care, that you couldn't get the childcare vouchers when you had a job, but when you didn't have a job, you could get the childcare vouchers when you are home. The whole process just isn't working. And I just appreciate you being here before the committee, and I just want to say thank you.    In regards to Mr. Mulligan and Mr. Steuerle, I would like to hear if you both would like to add some additional comments of how you could help incentives that we could try to break this poverty trap to the benefits curve.
