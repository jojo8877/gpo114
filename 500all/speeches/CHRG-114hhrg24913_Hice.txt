    Mr. Hice. Yes.    The Clerk. Mr. Hice votes yes.    Mr. Russell?    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Herring, it seems that the State Department initially requested the (b)(5) exemption. Is that correct?    Mr. Herring. Sir, I'm actually--I wasn't in position at the time they were doing all of that. So I'm not----    Mr. Hice. Is that your understanding?    Mr. Herring. I'm not sure which exemptions they claim. Are you talking about the redactions?    Mr. Hice. Right.    Mr. Herring. I'm not sure what the State Department asked for.    Mr. Hice. Okay. And it is my understanding that the FBI overruled that. Do you have any awareness of that decision?    Mr. Herring. We don't typically--we're the investigative agency. So when it comes to matters of classification, we typically defer to the owners of the information. So----    Mr. Hice. Okay. Well, Ms. Frifield, let me go to you, then. Why was State trying to use this extremely broad exemption?    Mr. Hice. So you're not familiar with the (b)(5) exemption?    Mr. Hice. So you don't have any idea who made that decision?    Mr. Hice. As a normal course of action given that exemption, would anyone outside of State Department have been consulted?    Mr. Hice. So it would be your assumption, then, that probably there was some consultation?    Mr. Hice. You don't know that, but that would not be uncommon. It would somewhat from your understanding be something----    Mr. Hice. Okay. That particular exemption is basically, among at least many people, known as a withhold because you want to withhold exemption. Have you heard that expression before?    Mr. Hice. Okay. It's very, very broad. And it gives every appearance, at least, that there's a reason to try to hide information. And that's the frustrating point of all this.    Let me ask this: What criteria is used, do you have any idea, when it comes to redacting information?    Mr. Hice. Well, I would like to draw a distinction between FOIA and a request from Congress.    Mr. Hice. So how does that differ from a request from Congress?    Mr. Hice. Well, we're filled with redactions with what we have.    Mr. Kadzik, let me ask you the same question.    Mr. Hice. What is the difference between making decisions of redactions from a FOIA request versus Congress?    Mr. Hice. All right. Let me go back to Mr. Herring. Because it seems to me like we're just going around in circles with all of this.    The chairman asked you earlier what you believe Congress should not be allowed to see or have information, and basically you said it varies from case to case. That's a pretty broad difference. Does it vary depending on, some cases, a high-profile individual?    Mr. Herring. No, sir. Let me try to answer it this way, if I could. When the Bureau provided records to Congress, really, we think that the redactions were very light. We redacted primarily the personally identifiable information for some of the folks. And, honestly, we do usually strive to protect information of a purely personal nature. And so as far as----    Mr. Hice. Excuse me. I've just got 20 seconds left. But there's a whole lot more than that that's been redacted. I mean, on page 48, for example, you redact Ms. Clinton's birth date. The very next sentence, four attorneys of hers are mentioned by name, a fifth one is redacted. That's not personal information. There are hundreds and hundreds of examples like this.    Mr. Herring. Certainly. I mean, I think a number of the folks mentioned in those documents are out there in the public in some form or fashion, and I don't think that there's any reason to--well, they're----    Mr. Hice. If they're in the public, then why didn't we get it?    Mr. Herring. The ones that are in the public you did get. The ones that are not in the public are the ones that were redacted, sir.    Mr. Hice. So is the standard for Congress based upon what you would give the public?    Mr. Herring. No, sir.    Mr. Hice. Well, then we should receive that and much more information.    I see my time has expired, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to continuing this. Thank you.
