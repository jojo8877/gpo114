    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    I want to thank our expert witnesses for their participation today, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for holding this important hearing on the OPM data breach.    As you know, I have the privilege of serving as the ranking member of the IT subcommittee. The issue of data breach is something that Chairman Hurd and I are quite concerned with, and we are looking forward to working with our colleagues to be active in addressing this issue.    All of us here today should be quite concerned. The OPM breach has raised significant questions about how adequately the personnel information of government employees is stored on government networks. We know that every day our government and American businesses face a barrage of cyber threats.    We are reminded of many of the high-profiled breaches on some of our Nation's most important companies, but there are everyday cyber intrusions of our data that aren't making the headlines. Whether it is criminals beyond our borders profiting from fraud and identity theft, domestic competitors who steal intellectual property to gain advantage, or hacktivists looking to make a statement against governments, cyber crime threatens our national security and economic prosperity.    Data breaches probably won't end any time soon, but they are something that we can be more aggressive in addressing. As we catch on to cyber attackers' methods, these bad actors will look to innovate their way around newly integrated cyber defenses. This is why we must be just as innovative. That is why we must have a frank conversation today and prepare a multi-front strategy to ward off and diminish the possibility of future data breaches.    So I thank the committee and our witnesses again for this opportunity to examine the OPM attack and, with that, I yield back.
