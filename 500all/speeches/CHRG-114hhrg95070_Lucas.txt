    Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Listening to you--to the panel, I suppose the one observation I would offer up is that in the nature of criminal activity, the desire of the criminal, of course, is to bleed the process, but not to kill the patient--to be able to return and bleed the patient again. Cyber activity that is nationalistic in nature, my phrase, clearly is out to inflict economic damage, to kill the patient.    So in the spirit of that, take me back to the fundamental rudimentary issues here. Describe for me how these kinds of attacks unfold in the fashion we are seeing now. And I don't care which member of the panel discusses it--how these cyber attacks unfold on financial institutions from the perspective of criminal activity or the perspective of a nationalistic effort.    Mr. Lucas. Gentlemen, on the criminal side?    Mr. Lucas. So the volume of attacks, I think was alluded to earlier, are increasing. At what rate would you describe from the criminal perspective this increase and is it from a dramatically different set of sources?    Mr. Lucas. Thank you.
