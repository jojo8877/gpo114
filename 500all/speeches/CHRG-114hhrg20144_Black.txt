    Mr. Black. I do not know much about specifics, but some tribes have chosen to focus on the juvenile population, and other tribes have focused on the adult. What they are doing is really looking at the treatment programs that are or are not available, working within their tribal courts for alternative sentencing opportunities, and then also for reentry. A lot of times, for individuals that are our repeat offenders, we can give them a certain amount of treatment, but then they go back to that same environment without any support. So the tribes are trying to build all of those components into the recidivism reduction effort. And as Larry mentioned, it has been very successful so far, so we are very encouraged.    Mr. Black. Let me address the housing question first. We have identified that, just like many other agencies, as a serious need in our remote locations, especially for recruitment and retention of law enforcement and social services personnel.    We have been able to carve out some funding over the last few years to build some quarters for our law enforcement staff at some of our high priority locations. We will be looking at a couple more locations this year to try and get some new housing in there. It is just a matter of going through and trying to prioritize with the limited funding that we have, those areas with the most need right now. And we will continue to do that and evaluate that.    We have had conversations in the past with some of our tribes about the economic development opportunity it could be to build some apartments or duplexes or something that BIA could enter into an agreement with a tribe to lease. So we are looking at our alternatives realizing the budgets are what the budgets are. We do have to get a little bit more creative in how we approach that.    Mr. Black. Yes. I believe that is a 638 contract by the tribe, so they look at the priorities of what they need to do for maintenance activities. There again, as you said, you've got 17 million acres out there, and a lot of roads to cover out in Navajo with limited road maintenance funding. And then you also have to throw in that the funding is also used for ice and removal, not just maintenance and blading of the roads.    So you are looking at all those factors. You have a really bad winter, it really affects the amount of actual maintenance you can do on those roads.    I am still waiting to get a briefing on the new FAST Act to see exactly what is all in there. Under the previous transportation authorization bills, tribes had the ability to use 25 percent of their construction funding to put toward maintenance activities. That was solely up to the tribe to decide if they wanted to do that.    And it honestly became a rob Peter to pay Paul situation because construction is just as important out there as maintenance is. I mean, if we have better construction, we have reduced maintenance.
