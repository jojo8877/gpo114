    Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Cohen, thank you for being here.    I cannot help but chuckle that their side of the aisle cuts two-thirds of the funding and then they blame you for not having proper oversight to make sure these CO-OPs exist. I think that is an interesting tactic, but I do not think it is particularly accurate.    Just as a bit of a refresher, can you just succinctly state the top three reasons why these CO-OPs failed?    Mr. THOMPSON. And had the money been there, the six billion that was in the original bill, would that have mitigated many of those problems?    Mr. THOMPSON. And I do not want to sound like an apologist for the CO-OPs. I was never a fan, but to reiterate what the Ranking Member said, this was the option that we had. What most of us wanted was the public option, and that would have provided the competition needed to really make the private insurers perform to a greater degree.    But when that option was taken away, this was kind of the fallback, and I think it is important to state that. And then when you take the money out that was put in to make the fallback work, it seems near impossible. I am surprised that any of them are still going.    In your oversight role, have you seen consumers and providers that value this CO-OP local option?    Mr. THOMPSON. Getting back to where he said he wanted to go when he started the hearing is to figure out where the problems are and make it work, how would you suggest that we as Members of Congress support these local options and to make sure that they work and deliver to our constituents?    Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you.
