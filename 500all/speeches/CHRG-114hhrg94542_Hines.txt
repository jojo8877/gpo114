    Mr. Hines. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Horowitz, in your office report you noted that during the interviews some in your office staff were evidently told that some DEA employees were under the impression, at least, that they were not to discuss information regarding open cases.    Do you know who provided that information?
