    Mr. Babin. Yes, sir. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all you witnesses for being here.    The EPA Administrator, Ms. McCarthy, Gina McCarthy, wrote an op-ed recently saying that the Agency's air standards attract new business, new investment and new jobs. I don't think that Administrator McCarthy is living in the same world as the rest of us.    I represent the 36th District in the State of Texas, and we have one of the largest numbers of petrochemical plants and refineries in the country. Most of my district is not in attainment with these new regulations. I will also add that neither is Yellowstone National Park in attainment with these new regulations.    There is no concrete evidence to support the lower standard for ozone that the EPA is calling for, not to mention the cost that is associated with it, given the strenuous economic times. I would now ask for a slid be placed on the screen to describe my district, the State of Texas, District 36. We have the largest manufacturing industry in the State of Texas in the chemical and refining industry. We directly employ or indirectly employ over 10,000 people down there in this portion of my district, and we pay $934 million in wages in this district with an average wage of nearly $100,000.    These proposed new rules promise to be the most expensive regulations in the history of the United States, likely costing us thousands of jobs and prolonging a recession. This is bureaucratic overreach in the extreme.    I would ask Mr. Kovacs and Mr. Eisenberg whether this is worth putting all of this at risk with these new regulations. Mr. Kovacs?    Mr. Babin. Which is what the Secret Science Act is all about we're proposing.    Mr. Eisenberg.    Mr. Babin. Thank you very much, and I yield back my time, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
