    Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Director, welcome, and to your staff. I was looking at your resume, your work record as a prosecutor. I did that for 11 years myself on the state level, state district level, so I commend you for your education and your experience in that regard.    Pardon my raspy throat, I have caught it.    The chairman rightly said that the FBI has a critical mission in protecting the homeland. And frankly the charge of, to the FBI, has changed absolutely dramatically over the last decade or so. When I first came to Congress in 1981, you know, we were focused on catching armed robbers and all of that. But now it is such a sophisticated and complicated new charge that you have, dealing with counterterrorism, hostile foreign intelligence agencies, espionage, domestic and foreign cyber threats. Cyber is a new word, now it is a new challenge. And then of course the traditional catching of crooks and thieves and dangerous criminals here at home, particularly drug related and especially prescription pill attacks that CDC says is a national epidemic.    So you have a hefty load. And we are going to try to give you what we can afford to help you fight all of these charges. And it will not be enough. But there is a limit on what we can appropriate. We are confronting an extremely difficult budgetary climate here. In fact we are debating today on the floor the budget, which is severe and strict. It stays within the sequestered levels. So we are not dealing with a lot of new money, hardly any.    It is extremely important for you and others like your agency, which relies so heavily on intelligence information, to leverage and maximize the partnerships forged at the local, state, and even international level to ensure that every penny the taxpayer spends is targeted, efficient, and effective. In fact last week I visited with the Interpol headquarters over in France, had my second visit with them. And in the last several years that agency has grown.    When I was there the first time ten or 15 years ago, the difficulty I saw at that time, that our agencies over here were not participating in Interpol as they should. Now they are. And it is imperative that we continue that work with Interpol, as I am sure you will agree.    You have been taking strides in recent years to streamline and optimize your intelligence components. But I think we can all agree that much work is still to be done there. Last year you requested and we granted permission to restructure the FBI's intelligence program to more seamlessly integrate intelligence and operations. And I hope you can provide us with an update on those efforts in a minute. Particularly as we all begin to assess the report evaluating the FBI's implementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations.    Finally I want you to provide the committee with some information about how the Bureau is working to combat the threat of homegrown domestic extremism. ISIS has demonstrated very sophisticated recruiting techniques through the internet and social media. And by some accounts as many as 20,000 fighters have traveled from 90 different countries to fight in Syria, including some 150 I understand from the U.S. that we know about.    It is imperative that we work to prevent the radicalization and recruitment of American citizens who could later return to the U.S. and cause us harm. And I know the FBI has an important role to play in that regard. We would like to hear about it.    So Mr. Director, thank you for your work and your career, and we thank you for your dedication to your country, and your service to your country, and all that you command. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    [The information follows:)              Mr. Rogers. The biggest change that I have seen in my experience, as far as the FBI is concerned, over the years has been the graduation from investigating already-committed crimes and preparing evidence for prosecution and then there is today's world where you are working more in preventing, trying to prevent events, including crime, before it takes place; counterterrorism, trying to prevent terrorism; trying to keep spies away; the constant barrage of cyberthreats, foreign and domestic; prevention, rather than prosecution, although it may eventually may be prosecution. That is a significant change, and it has taken an effort on the part of the FBI leadership over these last few years to try to get it through the agency's head about this new world in which we live and the mission of the FBI, more in prevention, actually, than prosecution.    Do you agree with that?    Mr. Rogers. Well, and the current world war, frankly, the war of terrorism and violence is a worldwide event, so we are in a world war. And we are up against a very sophisticated, capable enemy. The recruiting of foreign fighters into Syria and Iraq, we have not found a way yet, in my opinion, to effectively stop or even slow it down. And it is more than a law enforcement and it is more than an FBI mission, but it certainly is an FBI mission.    But just last week we learned about a 47-year-old Air Force veteran who tried to join ISIS, and before his apprehension, Tairod Pugh worked for a number of American firms overseas, including a U.S. Defense firm, in Iraq for whom Pugh performed avionics on U.S. Army aircraft. We have had several stories like that, that have appeared. Is there a magic bullet to try to get at that kind of a problem that the FBI can do?    Mr. Rogers. We switch completely to the prescription drug problem which has been devastating in my part of the state and the country, particularly Oxycontin, but now that we are beginning to make a dent in the pill mills, closing them down in Florida and Georgia and other places and finally getting FDA to change the formulation of drugs like Oxycontin to make them non-abused, a lot of the country shifting to heroin, and the drug cartels in Mexico, I am hearing, are now getting into the pill business because of the enormous profits there.    What can you tell us about that?    Mr. Rogers. Well, still, more people are dying from prescription pill abuse than from car wrecks. So even though a part of the country is switching to heroin, the pills are still a problem in a big part of the country.    Mr. Chairman, I have abused my time.    Mr. Rogers. Quickly, and finally, cyberthreats, where are we?    Mr. Rogers. Do we have absolute evidence, absolute proof that these attacks, many of these attacks are from states?    Mr. Rogers. Countries?    Mr. Rogers. Governments?    Mr. Rogers. Military?    Mr. Rogers. Russia?    Mr. Rogers. We have proof that Russia and China and other Governments are attacking our country's cyber information databases?    Mr. Rogers. What are we doing about it?    Mr. Rogers. In fact it was this subcommittee, Frank was the chairman many years ago, who first brought attention to foreign governments hacking into his files and he sort of led the way, but, boy, it has come a long way, and I am not satisfied at all that we are doing what we need to do to try to stop it or counteract it.    Thank you, Mr. Director.
