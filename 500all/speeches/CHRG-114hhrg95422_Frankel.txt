    Ms. Frankel. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    First, Mr. Chair, I would just like to say thank you to Josh Cohen. This is his last full committee. He has been my adviser. He has done a great job. He is going off to Harvard, to the Kennedy School. And we wish him well.    Well, this has been a very troubling discussion. First of all, thank you all for sharing. I mean, you can't help but after listening to all this feel a lot of anxiety. So, first, I want to ask a hypothetical, if it is possible for you to answer, which is I think we went into this, the P5+1, I think it was November 2013 when they first agreed to the plan that is, this temporary plan that is currently in place, and then it began in January 2014. Had this joint plan not been in place, do you think by now we would have had to take military action to stop a nuclear weapon?    Ms. Frankel. Does this mean that you feel that the better alternative now would be to try to increase sanctions?    Ms. Frankel. Rather than take the deal?    Ms. Frankel. Do you other gentlemen agree with that? Or have a different opinion?    Ms. Frankel. Dr. Pollack, you may answer that but I just want to add something to that question, which is, do you see the potential--let's say we are at the negotiating table, and we just said, no, we can't, this is not the deal we are going to accept. Do you see the potential of Iran then again moving toward a nuclear weapon, taking further steps?    Ms. Frankel. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
