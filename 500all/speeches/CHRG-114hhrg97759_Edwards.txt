    Ms. Edwards. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the members.    I was sort of curious. I don't know if Mr. Foster had a chance to--we were kind of speculating over here as to whether there's value in doing the kind of marking of all of these different sources to determine whether there was at some point sort of one general dispersion so that there is a relationship between potential life that we might detect one place and another, and so I don't know if that kind of work is going on. And I wondered, Dr. Lunine, if you could speak to that.    Ms. Edwards. Yes.    Ms. Edwards. So then that leads me to another question. And, Dr. Lunine and Dr. Bean, in a 2007 National Academies report called ``The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems,'' there was a caution against searching for a model of life that's based on the model that we know here on Earth and a conclusion that life is possible in forms different from those on Earth. And so I wonder if you could talk to me about the recommendations that came from the report to further inform investigations to detect and identify possible forms of life and other planetary environments?    And I think, Dr. Lunine, in your testimony, in your prepared statement you asked whether the seas of Titan should be included in our search for life because of the Titan's use of methane as a working fluid in place of water? So I guess my question is to what extent would missions to Titan and other potentially habitable environments be able to investigate habitats of life forms that are different--that may be different from those on Earth?    Ms. Edwards. Dr. Bean, in the time remaining.    Ms. Edwards. And I've greatly exceeded my time.    Ms. Edwards. And I thank the gentleman from Colorado. We pulled a fast one on the Chairman there.    Dr. Stofan, I just had one question about how you're planning to use the Astrobiology Roadmap that's going to be released later this year and a year later than initially thought. Will it be a major vehicle that NASA is going to use to establish priority and--priorities? And then what kind of challenges did the agency face that caused a one-year delay to the issuance of the roadmap?    Ms. Edwards. So just really quickly, is there a plan to have the National Academies review the roadmap as well?    Ms. Edwards. All right. And with that, I will yield back to the gentleman from Colorado and just say I am--I do get a little bit concerned with these, you know, constant discoveries which are really great and we find incredibly fascinating, that the public then becomes numb to it in a way that would harm us in terms of making sure that you have the resources that you need.    And with that, I yield back to the gentleman----    Ms. Edwards. --from Colorado.
