    Mr. Perlmutter. Thanks, Mr. Chair, and thanks to Mr. Rohrabacher. Honestly, this is an area where I'm new to this subject and new to this Committee, so I'm going to have some very basic questions for you.    My district includes Rocky Flats, you know, where we produced a lot of plutonium triggers over the years. North of us, we have a mothballed long time ago plant called Fort St. Vrain.    Mr. Perlmutter. And so I'm coming at it from that point of view, so I'm going to ask just sort of basic questions. How many nuclear plants do we have in the United States today?    Mr. Perlmutter. Yes.    Mr. Perlmutter. And how many license applications do you have pending?    Mr. Perlmutter. How long would you say the average license application runs today? I mean, I know it has varied. Sometimes it's taken forever and sometimes it's been quicker. What are they running today?    Mr. Perlmutter. I just want the--I'm not condemning that. I remember----    Mr. Perlmutter. I had Rocky Flats, okay? I have legacy.    Mr. Perlmutter. I understand the public safety nature of the Commission, so I'm not----    Mr. Perlmutter. --condemning that. I want you to do the right thing and do a good job.    Mr. Perlmutter. Construction of a plant, how long does that usually run?    Mr. Perlmutter. I mean, these are major----    Mr. Perlmutter. --construction.    Mr. Perlmutter. All right. Now to get towards Mr. Rohrabacher's questions. So can you tell me--and I know--I'm a lawyer, you're a lawyer, and you know, maybe you would want an engineer but my guess is, you know this. So can you explain to me the difference between heavy water, light water, and some of the new technologies that he was just going through--thorium and gas plants and whatever.    Mr. Perlmutter. But light water would----    Mr. Perlmutter. Okay. I'll see you in the gym.    Light water versus heavy water, and then I'll yield back.    Mr. Perlmutter. I'm happy to meet with you and anybody else.    Mr. Perlmutter. That would be great.    And I yield back to the Chair. Thank you very much.
