    Mr. Harper. Thank you, Chairman Miller.    I would like to commend you and Ranking Member Brady on the strong show of bipartisanship represented by the handbooks which we are considering today. The update of these regulations is overdue, and there is a reason for that. Finding consensus on a group of regulations that affect the operations of over 435 Member offices, all of the standing committees, and several Member organizations is no easy task.    I want to thank the staffs on both sides, majority and minority, for their commitment and tenacity in seeing this task through. I know you spent countless hours on probably countless versions of these regulations, and I want each of you to know that we appreciate your efforts.    Most Members will probably never see these regulations and would not likely read them if they did perhaps, but their daily activities are governed by them, and it was important to get them right. So I thank everyone involved in this and the staffs.    And I yield back. Thank you.    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for his comments.    Any other Members wish to make an opening statement?    The gentleman from Chicago--excuse me, Illinois, not Chicago.
