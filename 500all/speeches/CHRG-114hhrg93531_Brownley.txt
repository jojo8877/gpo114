    Ms. Brownley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it. I am a new member of the T&I Committee, and very, very honored to be able to sit on this subcommittee. And I have a very specific question, probably for you, Admiral. And it is--my understanding that the Coast Guard air station currently located at Los Angeles International Airport will be relocating to Point Mugu Naval Air Station, part of Naval Base Ventura County, which is in my district. I am very excited about this news, very pleased about the move, and look forward to welcoming new personnel to Ventura County.    My first question is, if Congress does fail to fund DHS programs this week, would the shutdown affect the planning of this move, and would it impact it at all?    Ms. Brownley. And what is the timeframe, exactly, for this move?    Ms. Brownley. And in terms of buildings there, have you identified the buildings that need to be ungraded?    Ms. Brownley. And the money proposed within the fiscal budget, is that money enough to cover all of the costs and the upgrades on the site? You wouldn't need any additional money----    Ms. Brownley. Thank you, sir. And I yield back.
