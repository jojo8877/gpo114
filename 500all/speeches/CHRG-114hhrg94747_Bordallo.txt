    Ms. Bordallo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Secretary Wormuth and Admiral Locklear and General Scaparrotti, I want to thank you for coming today.    And as the representative from Guam, I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, your calling the committee together, for taking time to further examine our posture in the Asia-Pacific region.    Admiral Locklear, I have a question for you. As the ranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee, I would like to focus on training capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. Our Marines in Okinawa have degraded training capabilities, and the Army and the Air Force have significant degradation of training capabilities elsewhere in the region.    Can you comment on how the Department is looking at improving these capabilities? We are moving forward with a live-fire training range on Guam, but what about larger training exercises and the need for improving training capabilities in the Northern Marianas Islands? I think that the committee has questions about the cost, and I understand PACOM has a handle on many of these matters. So could you answer that for me?    Ms. Bordallo. Thank you. Thank you very much.    Admiral, I have another question for you. Can you comment on the progress of the U.S.-Japan defense guidelines, and what do you envision occurring to implement these guidelines in the near term?    Ms. Bordallo. I was going to ask, yes, the Secretary as well.    Ms. Bordallo. Thank you.    Madam Secretary.    Ms. Bordallo. Very good.    Ms. Bordallo. Thank you. Thank you very much.    Mr. Chairman, I have just one quick question.    Admiral Locklear, what will be the impact of our rebalance strategy if sequestration remains in place?    Ms. Bordallo. Thank you very much.    And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
