    Mr. Carter. First, Mr. Chairman, I apologize. I was chairing Homeland Security's inquiry into our Coast Guard and couldn't get loose, but I am glad to get here to at least get in on the tail end of this conversation. I know the work you do is very, very important to the future of our country, and I thank you for it.    Mr. Carter. Thank you for all the great brains that work out things that I don't understand, but they work, and that makes me happy.    I understand that you have spoken to potential gaps associated with the number of Aegis BMD systems we have employed and the current threat assessment. Is the DoD taking an innovative approach to development and employment of a cost-effective sea-based DMD alternatives, including the active DARPA--Navy joint program developing an autonomous ship which could be fitted with a diverse sensor package?    Mr. Carter. Yeah.    Mr. Carter. Yeah. I was going to ask a question about David's Sling, but Mr. Israel has already asked that question, so, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Carter. Tell me about directed energy. And I understand the cloud cover thing, and I am--this is a learning process for me, but, like, in the mid course of a launch or the terminal phase of a launch, could you use directed energy to take out a missile at that phase?                                     ------                                    Mid course would be a little harder, much harder, and that is why you see us talk about focusing on boost phase intercept, because that is really the best place to get it before it deploys its reentry vehicle.    Mr. Carter. And if I understand what you have talked about, you have got a THAAD battery on Guam, right?    Mr. Carter. And that is carry--how many missiles are in that?    Mr. Carter. And then you are proposing to put THAAD on the Korean Peninsula?    Mr. Carter. What potential would that have?    Mr. Carter. Would that THAAD deployment be adequate to protect Korea?    Mr. Carter. Of course, one of the problems with Korea is Seoul is, like, 35 miles from the DMZ.    Mr. Carter. Right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And both of you, welcome. I am glad to see you. One of my blessings in life is I consider both of you friends.    General Odierno, you addressed a question Mrs. Lowey asked about the national security strategy and that we would not be able to implement that. There is a further factor, and with the mission in Korea I am reminded of it. The last time the world fell apart in Korea we had an event that all the Army people tell me about all the time, Task Force Smith, where the only trained, and they were only partially trained, soldiers, even though there were a couple of divisions in the region, isn't that right, were just about 500-and-some-odd soldiers over in Japan that were partially trained. And they called that Task Force Smith and they put them in the line, and basically that was about as close to the Alamo as it got on the Korea Peninsula as far as what those guys had to put up with. And that is one of the things the Army has always said, we are not going to ever let happen again.    And as we discussed the drawdown, I think it is important that you give us a picture of the rebuilding task that you would have should that emergency or others like it occur. And let's just use, for example, if we had to take our Army, if it fell below 450,000 and we had to add 50,000 trained and ready-to-fight soldiers, what kind of a task would that be and what kind of a time schedule would that be?    General Odierno. We experienced in the 2000s as we added brigades to the Army, it took us 30 months to add one brigade combat team, and that has to do with the cycle of how long it would take to recruit, how long it would take to go through basic training, how long it would take them to go through collective training. And that was when we were pushing it very hard, it took us 30 months. So it is a significant amount of timeframe.    That is why the readiness of both our Active and Reserve Component becomes critical, because we will have to use every bit of those assets as soon as possible, and that is the concern as we look at our readiness levels.    Mr. Carter. And basically the Army has proven as a fact, the more training, the more survivability, the less training, the less survivability.    General Odierno. That is correct. And it is about doing it consistently over time every year, training, training, training. That builds more and more capability.    Mr. Carter. So it is easy sometimes for us to see the picture of numbers. It sometimes is hard for us to see the picture of time it takes to make an effective fighting soldier.    General Odierno. If I could just take a second, Chairman.    Mr. Carter. Well, so am I. And having just come back from Ukraine and seeing what the future holds for potentially untrained troops facing against trained troops in that region, not ours, but other people's, disaster looks you right in the eye in that situation.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Carter. No. No, sir. No, sir. I know some, though.    General Dempsey once stated that we don't walk out on our forward operating bases unless we have the confidence that if we are wounded we have someone there who can help care for us and evacuate us back to the next level of treatment.    As you know, planning and employing echelons of medical care is vital in setting the conditions for our service men and women to provide the best possible care for those we put in harm's way. There is overwhelming evidence for how successful our military has been at saving lives in large-scale deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe that we call that the golden hour.    Now, as we wind down operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, how are we transforming our echelons of care without reducing the quality of care? We are deploying small contingencies with less medical assets to a lot of new places. Are we able to replicate the quality of combat care we have in places like Afghanistan?    Can you walk us through the care our troops would receive if they suffered a critical injury as a result of, say, a vehicle rollover, a range mishap in a place like Ukraine or Romania? Can you speak to the process of establishing and operating echelons of care in areas where we have recently expanded other operations, Africa and Eastern Europe?    Are there any constraints on medical resources which could potentially result in us becoming overly reliant on host nations? In other words, does that golden hour extend to small units scattered all over the world? And how do you do it?    General Horoho. I will start, sir, but it is kind of a joint response when we are looking at this. When we look at what we are doing in Europe there is a tremendous amount of training that is being done in Grafenwoehr in really looking at how do we capitalize on the capabilities that we have in the U.S., but with our coalition partners, so that we have a certain standard level of care. We are also incorporating telecapabilities into some very remote areas so that we take expertise from our bricks and mortar and we extend that through IT systems to get that knowledge to our young combat medics and combat lifesavers so that we are having a larger virtual reach, which I think is very important.    We are also looking at medical diplomacy in how do we today, where we don't have engaged conflicts, how do we today help build up the capabilities within our coalition partners so that we have better integration and a certain standard level of care. And then we are taking the lessons learned that we have seen over 13 years of war and getting those back into our training centers to make sure that our skill level maintains.    Mr. Carter. And that kit has a 5-year shelf life. When do you believe you are going to deploy that?    General Robb. Sir, I will have to get back to you with that, because I know we are working all the contracting issues on that. And as far as the contract being let out, I can get back to you on that. Yes, sir.    Mr. Carter. Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Carter. Would the gentleman yield for just a second?    Isn't part of the reason people go to compounding pharmaceuticals is that the FDA hasn't reached these drugs, which they have been approved? I am just going to tell you the story. My wife has an esophageal problem that they have not been able to fix, and the doctor said, well, they have a product that has been approved in Canada and it seems to be very effective, go to a compounding pharmacy. And we got that product, and it is very effective. And the only reason it is not on the market in the United States is that FDA has not reached it yet. So I am going to have to speak out that at least in my experience, it was quite a lifesaving drug.
