    Mr. Hudson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, sir, for being here today. I heard you answer an earlier question about that once the transitional reinsurance program ends in 2017, the question of given that United Health pulled out were you concerned about other companies pulling out of the program, and you indicated that you didn't think there was much concern of that.    But I am just curious as you are looking at that who are you discussing this with? Are you talking to folks in the marketplace? How are you basing your decision that you think the market is stabilized?    Mr. Hudson. OK. So it is not your anticipation then that you are going to see a whole lot more companies withdrawing from these exchanges once this reinsurance, I mean, supplement is there? I mean, it is obviously creating a large liability for these companies and we are already seeing some pull out while they have still got the subsidy in place.    Mr. Hudson. Right. Well, has CMS discussed methods to convince some of these insurers to stay in the exchanges in the event that you see a dropout following the termination of this transition period?    Mr. Hudson. Well, when you start with these policy options what are you talking about exactly?    Mr. Hudson. OK. But other than just going through the State exchanges, you haven't had any discussions or any discussions about specific things you could do with companies thinking about pulling out of the exchange without this transitional subsidy, that there is no really plans or discussion of any other ways to try and convince them to stay?    Mr. Hudson. OK, thank you. Mr. Chairman, as my time is expiring I will yield back.
