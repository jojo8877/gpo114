    Mr. Brooks. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. This is my third hearing since 9:30.    From what I understand, you've already introduced----    Mr. Brooks. --Dr. Griffin.    Mr. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And witnesses, again, I apologize for being a little bit tardy, but I had a 9:30 House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing with Secretary of State John Kerry over the State Department budget, followed by Armed Services at 10:00 a.m. with General Breedlove on U.S.-European commands, so I hope you'll bear with me. I got here as quick as I could.    I do have a question for each of you. And, Dr. Griffin, if you could please lead off. Why do you believe--excuse me. What do you believe the proper role of commercial space could be in the context of a stable, long-term NASA strategic plan?    Mr. Brooks. Colonel Collins or Ms. Chaplain, do you have anything to add?    Mr. Brooks. Yes, ma'am.    Colonel Collins?    Mr. Brooks. Well, what are we paying the Russians now? Somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 or $70 million per ride?    Mr. Brooks. Do you think there's a market for the space station at that ticket price? Well, the Russians have sold one or two, haven't they?    Mr. Brooks. Okay.    Mr. Brooks. Thank you for that interesting insight.
