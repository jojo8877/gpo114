    Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Looking at the photograph here of the sage grouse, it is obviously a very beautiful bird, much like the heath hen. We don't have any of those in Arkansas. Matter of fact, if we were to see one, someone might assess that a bobwhite quail got too friendly with a dominecker hen. But, although we don't have sage grouse, we do have endangered species.    Ms. Clarke, you mentioned in your testimony that people manage species and regulations manage people. Do you feel that the threat of a listing is being used to micro-manage state policies and land use decisions?    Mr. Westerman. Are these efforts directed to avoiding the threat of extinction, or based on the actions of Federal regulators?    Mr. Westerman. And you referred to this earlier, but I have seen the same instance in my state, where the Federal employees who work for the Forest Service or Fish and Wildlife are really there on the ground, wanting to do the right thing, but yet it is regulations out of DC----    Mr. Westerman . That are----    Mr. Westerman. All right. Mr. Miller, your state has been the jurisdiction of choice for groups who prefer to manage sage grouse through Federal court decisions. Has it been your observation that the litigation is making a positive difference on the ground? Or is it just more paralysis by analysis?    Mr. Westerman. As we have talked about a little bit, the Idaho sage grouse habitat is particularly vulnerable to wildfire and invasive species. Does the Governor's plan recognize and address these threats?    Mr. Westerman. So is it your assessment that the sage grouse is doing better on state-controlled lands or federally-controlled lands?    Mr. Westerman. Ms. Clarke, do you have any data in Utah on the state versus Federal lands?    Mr. Westerman. Thank you.    The Chairman. Mr. Graves.
