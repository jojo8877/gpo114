    Mr. Ashford. Thank you, and most of my questions also have been asked and answered, though I just would stress that we export 50 percent of our wheat outside our borders. From Nebraska, we export 50 percent of our soybeans outside the state. It is a massively important part of our economy in our state, and it is growing.    Mr. Winkles, I would ask you--this is a good discussion. I am beginning to understand a little more about the need, certainly, of course, for reauthorization, but I am also sensing a need for some flexibility as we move forward if we are going to reauthorize for a relatively long period of time, which is a good thing. As we expand our trade, however, hopefully, as we expand our trade for agricultural exports from Nebraska and throughout the entire country, is there anything else, Mr. Winkles, if I might ask you, and I know there have been some discussions about other ideas, but with the system the way it is now, with the people we use now, do you see the advisory committee which has been mentioned, do you see anything else that we should be looking at in the reauthorization to ensure that, as trade does expand, which I fully expect and hope it does do, that we can meet our obligations and make sure that that grain is accepted in the countries we trade with?    Mr. Ashford. Yes. And just one quick follow-on to that--and there will be more changes as we expand our base of consumer-driven exports, the demands are going to be greater, obviously, as people become more educated on the products that they are receiving in other countries. But generally within the system we do have, you do believe, I assume from your testimony, that what we have is the base operation is appropriate and should be continued.    Mr. Ashford. Thanks. I yield back. Thank you, Mr.----    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.    And I would just ask if there are any further requests for recognition? No. I will recognize Ranking Member Walz for any final thoughts.
