    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and welcome to our panelists. Mr. Connett, what are your estimates for savings to the utility and to the customer, to consumers, achieved through the use of demand-response programs?    Mr. Tonko. And the savings to the utility?    Mr. Tonko. I hear you. Thank you. What percentage of the demand-response programs used by our rural co-ops are due to the use of electric thermal storage devices?    Mr. Tonko. OK.    Mr. Tonko. And in that regard, what proportion of your customers participate in the demand-response programs using electric thermal storage?    Mr. Tonko. And just as to how the consumers benefit from the use of water heaters that are incorporated into a demand-response program?    Mr. Tonko. OK. And obviously the ancillary piece of the avoidance of peak capacity plants, that would have to be addressed.    For Mr. Nadel and Mr. Roy, a question about water heaters and the fact that they are replaced about every 15 years, often when they have failed. So consumers often need to make quick choices about replacement. I have a few questions related to consumer purchasing. Will water heaters exempted from the standard be identified as such to the consumer?    Mr. Tonko. And then for either of you, will the consumer know that these products will not deliver more than 50 percent of hot water if they are not part of a utility-demand response program?    Mr. Tonko. But it doesn't mention a percentage? It just----    Mr. Tonko. OK. And then consumers do use the yellow energy usage information on appliances to make purchasing decisions. Do these labels need to reflect the dual nature of the energy usage of these systems?    Mr. Tonko. And if they are installed and are not part of a demand-response system, aren't they less efficient than the identical appliance installed as part of a demand-response program?    Mr. Tonko. OK. Gentlemen, I thank you. With that, Mr. Chairman, my time is----
