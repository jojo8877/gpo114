    Mr. Reyes. Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. It is an absolute honor to be with you today along with these distinguished witnesses to address what I consider to be one of the greatest evils plaguing our world today, specifically child sexual slavery, or the trafficking of children for sex exploitation. As the attorney general of the great State of Utah, I am the highest ranking prosecutor in our State and in this capacity familiar with all manner of crimes. I oversee approximately 80 certified peace officers who serve as investigators for the State, either full-time or from partner agencies that are affiliates of our Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force or Secure Strike Force, both multi-agency teams under the AG's office, focused on combating crimes such as child sexual abuse, exploitation, and child pornography, and disrupting the trafficking of women and children for various reasons, including sex and sex exploitation.    While I believe trafficking of persons is one of the most insidious of the many crimes we confront, sadly it is also one of the least understood and least recognized by the public. And as a father of six children, I want to change that. I know they are looping behind me, or to the side, some of the footage of the mission from October of last year when we went down to Cartagena and two other cities in Colombia; and if I have time, I will address and give you a little bit of context for that as Mr. Ballard may also.    Today in addition to offering my support for the International Megan's Law, H.R. 515, sponsored by the chair and passed by the House, I would also like to paint with a slightly a broader brush in giving texture to more comprehensive issues pertaining to human trafficking. And to that end, let me begin with a few generalized statistics regarding the trafficking of persons. There are currently an estimated 20 million to 30 million modern-day slaves worldwide, people taken or lured into servitude and held against their will. And to put that number in perspective, that is twice as many or more modern-day slaves than there were during the entire transatlantic slave trade from the 16th to 19th centuries, 300 years, which was by most scholarly accounts, 10 million to 13 million people. And I want to be very clear that I am not saying that in any way to diminish the blight that that is on our world history, but only to underscore the severity and pervasiveness of what is going on today.    Human trafficking has become the second most lucrative criminal enterprise internationally, trailing only drug trafficking and ahead now of even arms dealing and counterfeiting. It generates an estimated $150 billion or more annually but is very, very difficult to quantify because of how little is reported. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that 18 percent of the victims are forced into hard labor. Others are conscripted into military servitude, recruited for terrorism, forced into acting as suicide bombers, part of illegal adoptions, or even killed to harvest their organs on the black market. But the overwhelming majority, approximately 80 percent, are forced into sex slavery or sex exploitation. Sex exploitation includes forcing victims into prostitution and compelling victims to commit sex acts for the purpose of creating pornography.    Let me focus a few more statistics particularly on sexual slavery. Trafficking women and children for sexual exploitation is the fastest growing criminal enterprise in the world at this time, this despite the fact that international law and the laws of 134 countries criminalize sex trafficking. About 2 million children are exploited every year in the global commercial sex trade. That number is about 5 million if you are just talking about trafficking in general. Women and girls make up 98 percent of victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. Anecdotal estimates from survivors are that only 1 in 10 victims caught up in the life ever make it out alive, so that is 90 percent of the victims that will never make it out of the life alive.    According to the U.S. State Department, 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across international borders every year, of which 80 percent are female and half are children. Briefly a quote from a young international sex trafficking victim:        ``They forced me to sleep with as many as 50 customers         a day. I had to give the pimp all of my money. If I did         not earn a set amount, they punished me by removing my         clothes and beating me with a stick until I fainted,         electrocuting me, or cutting me.''    When I first heard experiences such as these, I thought that they were not humanly possible to endure. I am dreadfully sorry to report that I was wrong, having heard now from so many more victims that have corroborated the fact that these children can be raped dozens, if not scores of times, each and every day.    In February 2014, in my own home State of Utah, based on a tip from our immigrant community and a brave man who wore a wire to help us gather evidence, my office arrested Victor Emmanuel Rax, a central American individual, based on evidence of trafficking children, raping numerous young boys, and forcing them to sell his drugs, not only into high schools and junior high schools in our area, but even elementary schools in the Salt Lake County area. Upon arrest we consulted with our Federal law enforcement partners who indicated that they knew Rax, had tried to make a case against him for many years but that witnesses became too intimidated or disappeared in the past. They also indicated Rax had been deported seven times to central America where he had spent time in prison for crimes related to drugs and child sexual abuse and was a member of a notorious international gang. Rax had just come back into the U.S. after each deportation. We were not willing to let him escape again. When we, with the cooperation with our Federal counterparts, made the decision to prosecute Mr. Rax in the U.S. justice system and keep him here rather than deport, we had over 60 victims and witnesses come forward to testify by the time we filed information and charging documents. With such overwhelming evidence, Rax took his own life during the pendency of the trial.    With an International Megan's Law and attendant MOUs and bilateral agreements, Guatemala or El Salvador could have notified the U.S. to warn us of the monster within our midst. Also these countries have the expertise, software, forensic technology, investigative techniques, and prosecutorial experience that we have in the U.S. and that we have readily shared through organizations like Operation Underground Railroad, there may never have been a Victor Rax coming to Utah as they could have handled his case in his country of origin. The Rax case opened my eyes to the violations being perpetrated upon some of our most vulnerable. We have significantly increased in our State the number of investigations and prosecutions of trafficking cases during my administration. Just within the past 2 weeks, I participated with my strike force team on an undercover sting and raid of a massage parlor we believed to be a front for sex trafficking. It was a site that I had personally surveilled over a period of a year with my men.    In Utah we have worked closely with legislators to enhance penalties for trafficking and to treat victims as victims rather than perpetrators. During the Rax case, I heard of an organization based in Utah called Operation Underground Railroad, which was just starting up. When I spoke to the founder, Tim Ballard, I told him I was extremely impressed by three things: One, the emphasis that OUR, the acronym, puts into providing resources, counseling, training, and stability to victims that they liberate from trafficking, and the involvement of groups and people like Elizabeth Smart in their organization.    Two, I was impressed by the focus on training of local law enforcement partners in the various countries where they do operations to give or enhance the skills, techniques, and tools that they need to replicate the operations again and again; and some of the most gratifying moments have been hearing from our law enforcement partners after we have done missions in their countries, telling us that they have had success on their own using the techniques they learned from OUR.    Number three, I told Mr. Ballard the emphasis on letting local partners take credit for their wins and building up credibility with their own people and government were quite impressive. And over the past year, dealing with them, having participated as a partner and member of OUR, I would now add two more quick points. The talent and dedication of Mr. Ballard's team, former successful CIA, HSI, Navy SEAL, Special Forces, and law enforcement personnel, and lastly the effectiveness of the stings they set up.    As you alluded to, Mr. Chair, how do I know how effective the stings are, because I have seen them up close and personally, as you might be watching them on the sides here. And if it comes back to looping, I will perhaps editorialize a bit.    In October 2014, I joined an undercover sting operation in Cartagena, Colombia, organized by Operation Underground Railroad. There were two other simultaneous jumps in Armenia and Metagene, other cities in Colombia, and because of the success that this organization had, and here you are actually seeing on the side the table at which the transaction occurred where we were making the offer to buy and have a sex party. I believe at this very moment our law enforcement partners, CTI, or the Columbian equivalent of the FBI are swooping in to make arrests. I think the timing of some of the clips is not sequential, but this occurred on a group of islands off the coast of Cartagena. We isolated the operation to minimize the danger to anyone else and to maximize the opportunity to cut off escape by the traffickers and to make sure that we could assure the safety of those young girls and boys that we were liberating.    So we had set up on an island there the site for the party. The traffickers believed they were going to come and bring all of these young children to have a sex party with an affluent American businessman. Again, I was playing the role of the translator and bodyguard, the mean and menacing player, which I thought was a bit unfair. You see our law enforcement partners, including Coast Guard, local police, and CTI, very well coordinated. After months of work in excruciatingly detailed cooperation and coordination, we isolated the young ladies and the couple of young boys that were with them in one of those huts and transacted at the table, upon the successful transaction, the large amount of cash in exchange for the sex party. You will see law enforcement here now coming to take us down as we were posing as the sex participants and local law enforcement.    When they finished processing the traffickers, they allowed us to leave to head back to the airport. It was very touching to be able to say good-bye to those young girls knowing that many of them would be heading back home to families who had likely prayed for their safe return for a number of years. In other cases the families had no idea that they were actually being trafficked. They had been duped into thinking they were participating in a modeling agency. And so this is the type of work that Operation Underground Railroad does, very precise with buy-in from the highest levels of our sister nations. It is something that they welcome with the credit all going to their local law enforcement. And I will let Mr. Ballard finish out explaining more about that as I have a few more things to address before I summarize.    You see there, we saw up close the horror and helplessness in the eyes of your girls, ages 10 to 16, after the drugs that the traffickers had given them that very morning to take the edge off of what they were about to experience. And during those very moments now where it is being frozen around that table, they offered up these young girls as if they were desserts to be had for a minimal price. And the fear and, again, helplessness in their eyes was something I will never forget. Contrasted with the sense of liberation just a few minutes later and the hope that they had that they were going to potentially get home and be back safely with their parents.    All I can say is thank goodness that we were the ones there that day instead of real sex tourist predators. Not only did we liberate over 120 innocent girls and boys that day, cumulatively with the three missions that were done simultaneously and reunite them with families and get them much needed resources to start the long road to recovery, but again we trained local law enforcement with investigative techniques and software, and they have called us numerous times to report on their replication of other stings where they have taken down other traffickers and saved even more children.    People ask why the Utah attorney general went to Colombia. My reply, number one, because such a high percentage of those travelling abroad for sex parties are American. Some statistics suggest 80 percent or more of sex tourists may be American. I am embarrassed by that fact, that Americans provide such demand, and I feel a responsibility to remedy the scourge that my fellow countrymen have helped to create.    Secondly, helping to stop human trafficking no matter where it exists is vitally important, and to be clear, no State funds were used. I was not going down in my official capacity as the attorney general of Utah. In fact, nobody knew except for our closest law enforcement partners.    Three, and I think this is critical to this discussion, creating a firewall in countries like Colombia and the many other countries that OUR and other organizations like them have established to prevent future Victor Raxs from entering the shores of the United States and my State of Utah. Through the conference of Western Attorneys General, I and other State AGs have conducted bilateral training with AGs in Mexico and El Salvador to train and coordinate law enforcement resources; and I have met with the Ambassadors of Japan, Peru, the Philippines, and many others, including the Philippine Ambassador just again today to discuss further coordination and training. No leader with whom I have spoken from these countries is opposed to this even greater coordination as envisioned by the International Megan's Law. H.R. 515 also wisely provides for adding to the minimum standards for the principal diplomatic tool that the U.S. employs in this area, the Trafficking in Persons Report by our State Department, with its various tiers and incentives for our sister nations to achieve Tier 1 status.    So in summary, let me say thanks. International Megan's Law just makes sense. Codifying a requirement to alert law enforcement authorities in destination countries will allow our law enforcement partners worldwide to be more vigilant when known American child sex offenders are entering their countries, sometimes for legitimate travel, but too often for repeat offenses of child crimes, sex parties, and sex tours. And it will also provide law enforcement at the Federal, State, and local levels here in the United States, a much better chance to prevent domestic crimes when convicted child sexual abusers from other countries enter U.S. territory.    Fighting human trafficking is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. It is a humanitarian issue. It transcends any political differences or ideological divides. Its devastating reach grasps all walks of life and needs a united front for us to find success and give hope to victims and survivors worldwide.    I would urge the Senate and anyone listening to this hearing to support passage of this law and others aimed at curbing and eventually ending child sex trafficking. Thank you.    Mr. Reyes. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Mr. Reyes. Mr. Chair, are you ready----    Mr. Reyes. Mr. Chair, can we say we are proud of our entire Federal delegation especially here today. Thank you, Congresswoman Love. She is not telling you everything. She has actually been helpful in a number of ways, including an operation or several operations that have occurred in Haiti, given her Haitian heritage and we appreciate her support and all of your support, so I just wanted to acknowledge her and everything she has done to support Operation Underground Railroad.    Mr. Reyes. Thank you. Are you going to recess now, Mr. Chairman?    Mr. Reyes. Let me quickly try to address one or some of the questions that were posed perhaps at a surface level and then I will allow Mr. Ballard who is our operations director----    Mr. Reyes. You know what, I am happy to defer too. Let's let Ms. Jacinto address those things. And then we can come back.    Mr. Reyes. Tools that we need.    Mr. Reyes. Thank you so much. Thank you, Congresswoman. Thank you Congresswoman Wagner, and we so appreciate your fight to get us those tools that we need. It will be effective and we will use them. We won't let them go to waste combating these perpetrators and offenders. I know you are doing the State of Missouri proud and we feel that support from you. So let me just tell you brava. Thank you for your work.    And Chairman Smith, if you would like, let me say again, reciprocally, from our vantage point, we applaud everything that you all do. But there has been no greater warrior in Congress on behalf of fighting for the rights, fighting for these poor innocents than you, Chairman Smith, and we really take our hat off to you.    Mr. Reyes. Thank you for everything that you have done, not on human trafficking, on so many different humanitarian issues, and for the time that you have allowed us to have today to hopefully educate just a little bit more our peers, our countrymen and our fellow men worldwide and women about this issue.    You had a couple of questions. I am going to do my best to address----    Mr. Reyes. I will get to those questions. One thought occurred. Congresswoman, if you want some ideas about school programs, training on how to avoid being victims of child sexual trafficking or being victims of other sex crimes, please come talk to me afterwards. We have some fantastic ones in Utah and we would love to share them with you. And also, again, notwithstanding the praise and the recognition that you gave, I don't want to accept a disproportionate amount of credit for what my colleagues, my other attorneys general throughout the United States are doing, have done before me, and will continue to do. There are many great leaders on the Republican side, the Democrat side throughout the great States of our Nation who have taken a lead on combating human trafficking. And so again, on behalf of all of them, our national attorneys general, they are the frontline in many instances in this fight, and I want to pay respect and credit, and give credit to all of them.    To your questions, though. You asked what happens to survivors. And let me break that down domestically and internationally. Domestically, from our office in the State of Utah, we work with our Division of Child and Family Services, we work with nonprofits like the Elizabeth Smart Foundation, because in spite of the fact the liberating element of these operations gets the lion's share of the media attention, and it is kind of the exciting parts, the stuff you see on the news, we all know who work in this area that the true heavy lifting comes after the fact when these victims become survivors and then need the resources educationally, training, jobs, counseling, treatment, physical and psychological support and it is going to take in some cases a lifetime to help them overcome the atrocities that they have just endured. And so organizations like the Elizabeth Smart Foundation, domestically, safehouses that we work with are part of the comprehensive approach that we have taken to address what happens to these survivors now that they have been liberated.    Internationally, each country is different. Each country has different resources. Each country has a different capacity to provide resources, but one of the things that I admire most about Operation Underground Railroad, is that they will refuse to work with a country, or they will even forestall operations until that country gives its absolute commitment to give every resource available that they do have, to helping the victims once they are liberated. And in the case of Colombia, we worked with a humanitarian organization called Renacer, the rebirth, along with the Colombian Federal and state resources. So their equivalent to child family services.    You know, we need to put so much--you mentioned, Congresswoman, safehouses. The reason why only 1 out of every 10 leave the life alive is that there is no safety valve for them. They want to leave. They want to get away and so often there is no place for them to escape and so these safety houses are another way that we can help encourage them to leave and give them the protection of the State and Federal Government resources.    The second question, really quickly, that I want to touch on, you asked, Mr. Chair, how do we vet our Government partners? And to be candid with you, during the entire operation that I was on in Colombia, I really was more worried about potential false friends in the government maybe turning us over, or turning us into a cartel than I was about the traffickers. You know, neutralized them pretty quickly and they weren't an extreme physical threat. I will say this: OUR vets through a combination of their own international contacts, recognizing that many of them used to be former CIA operatives and members, and have established trusted relationships over decades along with our Federal Government agencies like HSI who help us vet and give us a measure of comfort with the actual agencies that we work with hand in hand to take down these criminals abroad.    So the reality has been testified to earlier, is that there are agencies that aren't as credible, and we do have to worry about them, and we are very careful. And there still is an element of risk. And no matter how much vetting and due diligence that you do, but that is a risk we are ready to accept when it comes to saving these little ones and bringing them back to their families. I will let others address the questions too.    Mr. Reyes. Well, let me say this, Mr. Chair, we certainly are welcoming to all organizations of whatever background that want to join the fight. But so many of our best partners in this effort are faith-based organizations and it does have a powerful impact in the healing process that I have seen. On a side note, I remember when I let my staff know that I was heading down. I have a chief civil deputy who is a two-star Army general, somebody that I greatly admire, a hero of mine. And he said to me--atypical of his usual deference to my position--he said, ``Boy, I wouldn't send my own troops down where you are going. You can't go.'' And my response to him was, ``General, I feel like God is on our side in this effort, and that He will protect us.'' And that I have counselled with so many of those survivors who have said that it was really God and faith that kept them alive throughout the process. And so, of course, in the healing process, I would expect that God and faith would play a critical role, and I am not ashamed to say that.    I think that that is an important component of it. Whatever someone's conception of what God or faith may be, I think it is critical.    Last thing, and this is, I guess, the beauty of having C-SPAN cover this, I get texts from people saying, oh, you need to cover this or that that you forgot to say. In terms of the girls that we worked with, many of them were able to get back to their families. And I think that is what people were curious about. Did they get home to their families? In some sad cases, it was their families that sold them in the first place, or the family environment is not a stable enough one where we feel comfortable putting them back in that environment. And so again, with our Government partners, and our nonprofit partners, both domestically and internationally, we take a very careful look at making sure we put these children, of course, with a deference to their families first, in a situation where they can win because the last thing we want to do is liberate them and set them up for failure without the resources that they deserve.    So it is true because people ask, sometimes their families, their direct immediate families were the ones that decided to profit from them, and so they may go to next of kin. However, I wouldn't be too judgemental. In many cases the families did not know that they were putting their children in harms way. In this very case they thought they were giving them a chance to make more money in 1 year in a modeling agency which is part of that culture, beauty pageants, than both parents could make an in a decade. And so then, you know, why wouldn't they want to help support their number of other siblings, and they innocently let their children go to be part of that.    There are English exchange programs. The women that we help liberate in my State, the victims we found out that they thought they were signing up for a United States cultural program or an English language program, and the wily traffickers, the ones who are cagier, will often, with a gun to the heads of the victims, essentially figuratively or literally, have them Skype their families every month to say, things are going great here. We love it in America. Learning a lot. But in the meantime, they are put 10 to 20 in a little flat, again beaten, raped, drugged, abused, and forced to be prostitutes, and their humanity is taken away, their dignity is stripped away.    So we do everything we can on the back end to give them chances to reintegrate and be successes like our hero here today. She said she admired us, but she is a real heroine to all of us. So again, thank you for your time. Thank you for all of your efforts. We hope your Senate colleagues are listening carefully to the testimony today.    Mr. Reyes. The dynamic you described, Mr. Chair, I believe is an accurate one, more and more. In fact, I think the prevalence of those who are traffickers is less from large, organized criminal structures and rather either smaller gangs or one-off cells. The vast majority of those traffickers that we encounter, especially when we are doing our operations, are really small. And ironically, and in fact in Colombia, the intelligence that we received on that particular cell that we busted came from high-level narcotraffickers. And, you know, perhaps there is honor amongst thieves. They said, you can handle this two ways: Either we will take care of these guys our way, and that might be a lot of collateral damage and carnage or the government can do something about it. And the government reached out to Operation Underground Railroad and said, Tim, please come in right now and help us devise a way to go after them without endangering other citizens. And so again, to my point, it seems to be less and less huge cartels, and much more just small organizations. Because historically, the downside has been very small. There hasn't been that much disincentive in terms of the laws that have been out there or enforcement. Things are changing with the laws that you are helping us pass domestically, Congresswoman Wagner. Things are changing, Chairman Smith, because of the International Megan's Law that will hopefully eventually be the law of the land. But I think that was an astute observation that you brought up.    Mr. Reyes. Congratulations. That is wonderful.    Mr. Reyes. Be our eyes and ears. Or theirs. And the trucking association has been terrific partners as well in some of ships and all of those together. We need everyone.    Mr. Reyes. No. Thank you, again. I would just concur with Congresswoman Wagner that education and awareness ultimately will be the biggest deterrent to fighting this. We can't just investigate and prosecute our way out of this problem. And when you are ready to come to Utah for an undercover sting, come on out. We will get you a flack jacket and we will put you to work, Congresswoman. Thank you. Congressman Chaffetz has been out with us several times.
