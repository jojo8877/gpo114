    Mrs. Torres. Thank you, Chairwoman.    How is CBP measuring the effectiveness of the technology deployed at the border, and what matrix are used and how does that compare over time?    Mrs. Torres. So over time, is this technology going to be able to utilize over actual manpower?    Mrs. Torres. I understand that they are--there is a need to make a serious commitment, financial commitment, and it is going to be a lot more--it is a lot more costlier in the beginning, but over time, you know, my question really is, is it smart to spend this much money upfront? Are we going to save it in having actual personnel costs, you know, a few years down the road, and how long? Are we really looking at that, at those statistics?    Mrs. Torres. Yeah. Over time, I can see where you can modify equipment a lot easier than personnel habits.    How is CBP defining situational awareness and operational control?    Mrs. Torres. Are all of these metrics that you are utilizing public, made public, this information?    Mrs. Torres. So this is where the public can better understand whether these investments are actually paying out in ensuring, you know, that we are minimizing the number of crossings?    Mrs. Torres. Okay.    Thank you.
