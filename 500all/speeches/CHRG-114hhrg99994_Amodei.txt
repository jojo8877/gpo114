    Mr. Amodei . We are going to call the meeting back to order. Thanks, Chief and Assistant Chief and Mr. Braddock, for your patience. I understand, Chief, you have leave at 2:45.    So we are going to start with the gentleman from California. I think he had some other questions.    Mr. Amodei. So please proceed.    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.    Anything from the gentleman from Mississippi?    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.    Mr. Amodei. The gentlelady from Florida.    Mr. Amodei. OK.    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.    Chief, I want to thank you for your response to requests to me, which kind of ties into the ranking member's stuff in terms of--and I know you are getting a little loose in the saddle or whatever. But I do appreciate the fact that having got a C or above in civics, I think I understand something about oversight.    So perhaps--we have had some luck with this in the future, subject to the chairman's approval--if we ask you to put together a briefing, with you and the Sergeant at Arms, we will have a chance to ask him tomorrow, to schedule that, as opposed to a letter, which in my experience, nobody else's, tends to take about a quarter of most congressional Members' terms around here. Not your agency specifically, that we can put together a briefing perhaps and get the Sergeant at Arms in the room, you guys in the room to basically have that discussion.    If that is appropriate, we will forward that on to the chairman and see if we can't get that done before you go join the ``older I get the better I was'' club.    Mr. Amodei. Well, my thought is we will just set a meeting, and the Members that are interested in it attend the meeting and can have the discussion.    Mr. Amodei. Great.    Chief, we kept you for 3 minutes, but over the course of how many years, that is probably about as good as it gets, so thank you for your service.    And thank you, folks.    Mr. Amodei. As always, members can submit questions in writing. We will work on that briefing.                                            Tuesday, March 1, 2016.    Mr. Amodei . We are going to restart this section of the meeting devoted to hearing the budget request of the Architect of the Capitol.    Mr. Ayers, welcome.    Mr. Amodei. I have got some stuff that talks about your statistics here, which is very good, and I will keep that in case I ever need to know that. But I don't think I am going to--since we are a little bit late, I will go ahead and forego that and defer to the ranking member from Florida.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz, your opening remarks, please.    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.    Mr. Ayers, we have your opening statement. If you want to summarize that or remove that from the record and start from scratch, the option is yours.           Summary Statement of the Architect of the Capitol    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.    The gentlelady from Florida.    Mr. Amodei. OK.    Mr. Amodei. Yes, ma'am. The gentleman from California.    Mr. Amodei. I would imagine that the devil would be in the details: Who do you contribute to? How is it insulated from your concerns?    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.    Mr. Ayers, just a couple of things. Where are we at--and these are just kind of housekeeping. So Cannon costs, is that on track? Guaranteed maximum price, all of those fancy things that you guys are up on, but there is no warning signs on the horizon as far as Cannon costs go.    Mr. Amodei. Good. Congratulations. How about the disruption stuff? When are the musical chairs going to start? Is that still scheduled based on the original information put out? And I know you could go on a long time. Please don't. Although you are not in Cannon anymore. Are you?    Mr. Amodei. And I know you are not in Cannon. Just supposed to be junior Republicans that are in Cannon.    Mr. Amodei. Only if you plan to sleep there. So how is that going?    Mr. Amodei. OK.    Mr. Amodei. Does that have anything to do with why you decided to leave, Mr. Farr? You are just like: I am not hanging around for that program.    I do want to let the ranking member know that I had some questions about future use of the page dorm. Took a tour of it a while back, shared those with the Architect's staff and House Administration's staff, and they did a phenomenal job of saying in a very professional way that those are some of the dumbest ideas that they have ever heard. And so I am not going to speak for the Architect's Office, but when they get back to you with their report, please have your heavy coat on and stuff like that, even if it is a warm day for: Well, have you thought about this, that, or the other sort of thing? And it has basically just kept me minding my own business, even though I walk by it every day.    But I completely agree with you in terms of the oversight stuff. It would be nice to know beforehand and have some meaningful input into that process.    I wanted to thank you publicly for the access that we have had to your divisions, whatever they are called, in terms of going through the various shops. You know, with your folks in the paint department, the folks downstairs in the metal stuff, the wood shop people and all of that have been absolutely great. You have been very responsive, which means that we don't have a lot to do in these formal settings.    I still do want to talk to the yard guys, though, because I am a frustrated farmer that lives on a 90-by-110 subdivision lot. So don't take that seriously. But anyhow, I want to thank you for that in terms the transparency and our requests have all been timely.    Finally, the last thing I have is just an update on how things are going at the Power Plant. We have boiler things. We have chiller things. What is the quick and dirty on that?
