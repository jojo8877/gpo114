    Mr. Sires. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being here.    I think you can take back to the department how concerned this body is that we don't seem to be part of any of this negotiation and we don't seem--that we seem to be bypassed.    I remember when the Secretary was here. We talked about Cuba, and I asked him point blank about negotiations. They said that nothing was going on in exchange for Alan Gross.    Now we have a situation similar to what we had in those hearings. One of the questions that I have is, can you speak to how the U.N. Security Council resolutions are being handled in the negotiations?    Because once these sanctions are lifted, I think it is going to be virtually impossible to reimpose them because I don't think Russia and China are going to go along with it. They have veto powers. So how are we handling this?    Mr. Sires. With all due respect, we don't get--you know, we don't get much on those briefings. That is like, you know, these classified briefings that we get--I can get more information on anything in my district than what I get here.    Mr. Sires. But the problem is some of this stuff leaks out and then we look like--the press comes to us and we look like well, we don't know what is going on with the administration. You know, I mean----    Mr. Sires. Yes, I know. I don't believe what I listen to when people come in front of me either, you know. Can you talk a little bit about the sanctions, about the----    Mr. Sires. Have you had these conversations with China and Russia, you know, on this issue?    Mr. Sires. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
