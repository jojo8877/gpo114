    Mr. Benishek. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the panel for being here today. Dr. Federoff, are the changes that have been made in the lab, treatment of plants, changed their properties any different than the way we have been doing it for thousands of years?    Mr. Benishek. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Going back, you are exempt from the rules apparently in Vermont, is that correct?    Mr. Benishek. So if you had to comply with those rules, would you be able to keep farming?    Mr. Benishek. I guess I don't understand. There is labeling requirements in the State of Vermont except that the Vermont producers don't have to--is there only certain producers don't have to comply or is it all Vermont producers?    Mr. Benishek. Let me ask a question, this time of the panel perhaps. Does anyone disagree that a voluntary labeling Federal rule, would that not give the consumers all the information they need to know? I don't understand any reasoning against that. Mr. Dempsey?    Mr. Benishek. Right. Right. Anybody else have a different opinion?    Mr. Benishek. All right. Thank you.    Mr. Benishek. Thank you. I am out of time it seems.    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Aguilar, for 5 minutes.
