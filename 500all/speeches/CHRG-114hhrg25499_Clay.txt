    Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And let me start with Ms. Rectanus. Do you know of any other government agency or private sector company that has to fully prefund the health care costs of its retirees?    Mr. Clay. But the 2006 Postal Accountability Act imposed that requirement on the Postal Service, correct?    Mr. Clay. How much money has the Postal Service been required to pay in, and has it been able to make all of these payments?    Mr. Clay. And so $28 billion is the value of the unfunded liability?    Mr. Clay. I see. Ms. Brennan, I understand that 86 percent of the losses that the Postal Service accumulated between the years '07 and '11 are attributable to this prefunding requirement. Is that right?    Mr. Clay. Do you believe that the prefunding mandate is unfair to the Postal Service, and do you agree with Mr. Rolando?    Mr. Clay. Is modifying this prefunding requirement an essential part of the joint reform proposal to which the Postal Service, postal unions, and certain mailers have agreed?    Mr. Clay. And how much money do you think this would save the Postal Service?    Mr. Clay. I see. Is it true that the Postal Service's retiree health care fund is already 50 percent funded?    Mr. Clay. And do you know what the current balance in that fund is?    Mr. Clay. Wow. The prefunding requirement may have made sense back in '06, but it no longer makes sense to have the Postal Service comply with a requirement that would force it into insolvency.    And just one question for Mr. Rolando. Give me your overall sense of how the morale is among Postal Service workers today.    Mr. Clay. Thank you for that response.    May I yield of the rest of my time to the gentleman from Massachusetts?
