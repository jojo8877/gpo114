    Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Chairman, I move that those portions of the hearing today which involve classified material be held in executive session because of the classification of the material to be discussed.    Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Chairman, simply thank you for holding the hearing.    General, for your service, and look forward to your testimony.    Thank you very much.    Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Chairman, I move that those portions of the hearing today which involve classified material be held in executive session because of the classification of the material to be discussed.    Mr. Visclosky. Chairman, simply thank you for holding the hearing, and Admiral, for your service and your presentation, and look forward to the testimony.    Mr. Visclosky. Admiral, you obviously do a lot of work with the intelligence community. Any gaps, anything that the intelligence community could do better or is being left undone that would be of assistance to you in your duties?                                ------                                -- -- --    I also think, sir, that the indications and warning piece, and General--I mean, Admiral Gortney talks about this, General Jacoby talked about it before in terms of a large gap in terms of being able to assess in a more real-time fashion where the TELs are and if they are going to come out or not.                                ------                                -- -- --    Mr. Visclosky. One thing to see it, it is another thing to know what the anticipated use and timing of that is.                                ------                                -- -- --    Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Chairman, I forget which hearing it was earlier this year, it was almost, and there was nothing funny about it, it was, well, there he goes again with another launch, but which one is the one you have got to be deathly concerned about?    Mr. Visclosky. Obviously we face a very complex threat. You talked about an integrated approach as far as the threat. Mr. Ruppersberger brought up cyberattacks on us. I am assuming you are in communication and coordination, though, with colleagues relative to the use of cyber against our enemies, on the theory you couldn't have enough delivery systems to protect us against all of the threats that if they can't launch in the first instance, we are a lot better off. Could you just explain that coordination, what is going on----    Mr. Visclosky . As far as our offensive, in a sense muse of that?    Mr. Visclosky. Okay.    Mr. Visclosky. Let me try one more.    Mr. Visclosky. No. He----    Mr. Visclosky. Yeah. I know Mr. Ryan won't.    Mr. Visclosky. We will do that. If I could, Mr. Chairman, one other one.    The General Accounting Office has expressed concern about the acquisition process, and I think we have probably talked about this in the past. Your test plan won't be completed until 2022 despite a plan to field 44 missiles by 2017. Could you address for us your take on the test plan and the risk of concurrency on this approach?    Mr. Visclosky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Visclosky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    You know, we have had discussions in the past about the Israeli program and our cooperation. There is a program with Japan as well, as I understand it. How is that progressing, and are there other partners or potential partners we can do development with that would help spread our costs?    Mr. Visclosky. Besides money, are we receiving any intellectual property and help as far as research and development from the Japanese?    Mr. Visclosky. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Visclosky. Chairman, thank you for holding the hearing.    Gentlemen, thank you for your service and being here today. I look forward to your testimony.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Visclosky. Will the gentlewoman yield for a second?    Mr. Visclosky. The question I have, are these individual buildings? This isn't necessarily a BRAC question per se.    Mr. Visclosky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    General and Secretary, I am just a bit behind, I think, because I left for a vote.    First question I have, when the chairman started originally we talked about the rotation in the three Baltic nations and Poland. As that rotation occurs, it is my understanding we will always have U.S. troops in those four countries?    General Odierno. The plan right now is, yes.    Mr. Visclosky. That is all I need. If I could get to the Ukraine and the European Reassurance Initiative, because we do have that contradiction where we have that drawdown in Europe generally speaking, but now we have the Reassurance Initiative.    As far as Ukraine, and I speak only for myself, I think if we simply continue on the path we are on, the government does not continue to be viable. Is there a list, do you have ideas, is it built into 2016 that if there is a decision made by the administration to increase assistance to Ukraine, and I am not talking about lethal assistance, but training, communications, ability to get through Russian jamming, what have you, is there, if you would, an unfunded list or is it included in the $789 million?    General Odierno. We have developed a list. The $789 million is based on the current parameters that have been set, which is nonlethal aid. If we get approval to do lethal aid, we would have to divert some of that money, change some nonlethal to lethal.    And then we have done some work, we have been focused mainly on defensive capabilities, specifically counterfire, because they have been devastated by artillery in many of their operations, as well, as you mentioned, EW. And so we are looking at some things like that, how we could help them, but obviously we have not moved. But we conduct assessment teams over there all the time to assess what their needs could be if we decide to go in that direction.    Mr. Visclosky. If there would be an increase in that type of aid, is that $789 million adequate, if you are looking ahead to 2016?    General Odierno. I would have to get back with you on that.    Mr. Visclosky. If you could.    General Odierno. I will.    Mr. Visclosky. If you need more.    On the medical compensation proposal, the Department has put forth a proposal on TRICARE cost-sharing. The question I would have is, whether or not the Army is assuming Congress approves the administration's request, whether the Army's medical treatment facilities can handle any potential increase in demand on their services if there is a change in the copay on TRICARE?    General Odierno. It depends from facility to facility. There will be some that can, there will be some that cannot. But part of the proposal is ensure that there is a TRICARE network outside that the dependents of our soldiers could go to.    Mr. Visclosky. Without utilizing the copay?    General Odierno. So what we are trying to do is the proposal would be that as they go outside, if that care is provided at any other installation on post, they would then not have to pay a copay off post. This is now I am talking about Active-Duty dependents. Retirees is a different issue. So part of that is the copay does go up for retirees.    Mr. Visclosky. Okay. As far as the women in service, I appreciate that since the chairman's memo in 2013 the Army has opened literally tens of thousands of positions previously closed to women. When reviewing the individual occupational standards for barred positions, are you finding that there needs to be any changes as far as opening up some of these positions? And how have the physical qualification studies been included and reviewed?    General Odierno. So we are still in the process of doing some of these studies. There are two things we are looking at. We are looking at the physical studies, we are looking at what impact that would have across training, recruiting, et cetera, meeting those requirements, ensuring that it would be fair for all soldiers. We are taking a look at all of that. We are also looking at an integration piece to this, is what does it take to integrate females into some organizations and make sure we set that up properly and set them up for success.    So that review is still ongoing. We have put forward recently to open up engineers, but we have not yet made a determination on armor and infantry. We are still finishing up our assessment of those activities, and I expect that those will finish up some time in the September timeframe.    Mr. Visclosky. Sure.    Mr. Visclosky. I do appreciate your good work and encourage you in the future.    And thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Visclosky. One line of questioning on cybersecurity, the Director of National Intelligence listed it as the first among worldwide threats. And cyber command three fiscal years all, 2014, started a 3-year funding program to realign military civilian and contract manpower positions. Given that 2016 is the third year in the realignment, how are you doing in the Army and will it take a bit longer?    General Odierno. Two things: We have been asked to form 42 teams in support of them and we are ahead of schedule in developing those teams to support them, but the Army has done several other initiatives I think are very important. We established a Cyber Center of Excellence at Fort Gordon Georgia, where we are now developing all our training, all our basic cyber, both enlisted and officer force. We have developed an MOS for cyber, which is new. We are the first service to do that. It has enabled us to focus resources on developing this capability, not only to support cyber command, but also to support the Army as we have to conduct cyber operations in the future.    So we have reorganized and we have invested heavily in the future of cyber. We also have a cyber institute at West Point that is reaching out to civilians and educational institutions to help us to continue to develop cyber capability. So we are really all in on this.    Now our cyber in the next few years will move down to Fort Gordon, that is scheduled for a couple of years. That will enable us to ensure that we have all of our capability in one place. It will enable us to garner the resources there in order to properly train, for us to conduct missions in the future.    So there is nothing more critical in my mind today, and I think we have invested in this in a variety of ways to support both cybercom and our cyber's role in supporting the combatant commanders and cybercom, as well as them supporting our tactical forces in the future, because I believe cyber is going to be an important part of our ability to be successful tactically as we look to the future.    Mr. Visclosky. Thank you.    Mr. Visclosky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    First of all, I want to thank the chairman for holding the hearing today. And I would associate myself with his entire statement, and thank all of you for your service and for what you do for the health care of all of our people in the military uniform.    Obviously our responsibility, as well as yours, is to see how, looking towards the next fiscal year, we can do it even better. And as the chairman alludes, we continue to have concerns relative to the communication between the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration, particularly given the Theater Medical Information Program that you run. So I look forward to your testimony and the question-and-answer.    And, again, thank you, Mr. Chairman.                    Lt. Gen. Robb Opening Statement    Mr. Visclosky. And if I could also ask a question on clarification. On the line of questioning, you had mentioned that what will be excluded are drugs not approved by the FDA. Why would they be approved now if they are not approved by the FDA? Myself, and I am only speaking for me, I think it is insidious when sales representatives, I was watching TV for a half-hour, you have five drug ads, and the physicians I talk to at home say they do. I mean, they know exactly what they are doing here. But if it is not approved already, why have they been approved?    General Robb. As you know, the FDA in our system exists, again, to provide safe and effective medications for our patients. Some of the medications, as you know, FDA, are approved for use in a certain manner or a certain delivery, but a lot of them are not in bulk compounds. And so that is what happens. They will take these bulk compounds, which are not FDA approved, but if you use them as individual drugs they are okay.    And so it is actually very complicated, and that is why we have been working with the FDA to have them look at, you know, give us some guidelines here so that we can move forward. And I think this has been a good relationship, not only with the industry, but with our beneficiaries and also with our providers.    Mr. Visclosky. I do appreciate the effort.    Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of Ranking Member Lowey, I just would want to for the record point out that she has long been an advocate of funding for congressionally directed medical research programs, and particularly for breast cancer and for funds that have been provided for Service-specific research projects in labs across the globe.    For the record, I would like to introduce three questions, if I could have the panel answer them, most specifically the question relative to, have results of military medical research been incorporated into practice, changed procedures, or improvement of care?    Appreciate it very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Visclosky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I would like to follow Ms. McCollum's lead, and I have a couple of thank yous. Annually there are TRICARE proposals that the administration has. I have spoken often that Congress has to step up here and make some decisions as well, but did point out in last year's hearing, General Robb, that I was concerned about one proposal that would negatively impact families that did not have access to a military treatment facility. And am pleased that as far as the proposals that have put forth this year, that concern that was expressed has been dealt with and eliminated. So I do want to thank you for listening to the committee.    Also, Admiral Nathan, in the past I have bitterly complained not about the Navy's commitment to helping people relative to the issue of suicide and mental health, but that the Navy has so many programs, they didn't have one good program. And you have established the 21st Century Sailor and Marine initiative, and it is my understanding there is some consolidation of programs taking place. So I would also want to thank you very much for that. I am assuming, again, there is more of a focus and fewer programs, if I understand that correctly.    Mr. Visclosky. I appreciate, again, the Navy listening to the committee's concern.    Mr. Visclosky. General Robb, I have a question on the Jacob Sexton Act that was authorized in the 2015 Defense Authorization Act requiring annual mental health screenings for Active, Guard, and Reserve military components. Could you update the subcommittee on the status of the implementation guidance for the new requirement and, if possible, an estimate as to when you anticipate it being finalized and distributed?    General Robb. Sir, I will have to get back with the specifics on that to you.    Mr. Visclosky. Okay.    General Robb. Yes, sir.    Mr. Visclosky. I would appreciate it. And also because it is a new requirement, if you have an estimate for the cost, and particularly if there is a cost associated with the fiscal year 2016 budget, whether or not you have adequate funds relative to the implementation. If not, if the committee could understand that.    Again, I would reiterate that on TRICARE proposals Congress is going to have to exhibit some intestinal fortitude, but would also think that the administration has to do a better job as far as, if you would, reaching out to retired populations, service organizations, and explaining exactly the need and what the implementations are.    For anyone on the panel, if I could ask two questions. One, do you feel more outreach and education on that side of this equation is taking place? And additionally, for some of the proposals, obviously there is always cost involved even if there is longer-term savings. Would the potential costs in the short term for 2016 be covered in your budget request?    General Horoho. If we look at the area of billing for services that bringing in civilians into our military treatment facilities or the billing for ER services, that is going to have a substantial upfront cost. We did the analysis just at one of our major medical centers, and it is about additional 200 people and the additional software that would allow us to do that. And so when you look at that across 300 and something hospitals, that has a large price tag.    I really believe that when we look at how to drive down cost, I think part of what we have to be doing and what we have been doing over the last 3-1/2 years is we spend right now a billion dollars a year just in obesity-related diseases across our healthcare system every single year, and 70 percent of the demand on our healthcare system is due to obesity-related diseases. And so just by really focusing on the aspects of health and the area of sleep, activity, nutrition, and then focusing on our wellness centers, we have 62 percent of those that have gone to our wellness centers just one time have had a 4 percent decrease in body mass index and a 15 percent increase in cardiovascular output.    That right there, it saves us about $200 to almost $300 per percentage of body mass index. That in itself will allow us to look at how do we decrease the cost of health care and then better utilize the systems that we have to be able to provide care.    Mr. Visclosky. The additional cost, do you have that included in the fiscal year 2016 request?    General Horoho. No, sir, we do not, for what just got proposed, because the proposal went forward, but the actual business case analysis was not associated with it, and those are concerns that the Services raised.    Mr. Visclosky. If some action is taken for 2016, let's be positive for a minute, would you be short some money for implementation then?    General Horoho. Absolutely, sir.    Mr. Visclosky. Could you for the record give us an estimate of that, because, again, we have the authorizers and ourselves. I think it would be important if there is some movement to make sure that you can proceed with the proposal. I appreciate that very much.    Mr. Visclosky. General.    General Travis. Just to your point about outreach, absolutely. I have personally walked into a room with 200 people that were TRICARE For Lifers and didn't know whether I would walk out.    Mr. Visclosky. I was going say, you are here.    General Travis. And I am.    Mr. Visclosky. That is a positive.    General Travis. And what is interesting is when you explain that the cost has really stayed flat all these years and the actual percentage of the benefit that is covered by the fees has gone down when you consider the cost of health care, 27 percent, I think, of the program was covered by fees when it was instituted in 1995, now it is down to about 11 percent, and that may be a little off. And everything that has been proposed last year, probably even this year, although I can't swear to it, I think gets us to about 13 percent of the benefit being covered.    And then you lay that against what we are really here to do, and that is the national security, and the percentage of the defense budget for this to be sustainable that this now eats. These are great patriots and Americans, and, frankly, I didn't get a single complaint out of those 200, and they got it, they understood it. So----    Mr. Visclosky. I think outreach is important so people know there is transparency and nobody is pulling a fast one here.    Thank you very much.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Visclosky. It is true.    Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Chairman, only to say that I was justly admonished by our colleague from Ohio. I did go to Zel's yesterday in northwest Indiana and have a chili cheese dog and fries to go. And I still am filled with self-loathing, but it was good. So I am going to try to do better today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank all of you.    Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Chairman, I do want to sincerely thank you for holding the hearing and allowing Members and outside witnesses to testify. One, I think it is very important to get our colleagues' input. Their knowledge of their districts, areas, and programs are vitally important to the subcommittee, and look forward to hearing all of their testimony. Thank you so much.    Mr. Visclosky. I simply would thank the gentlemen too for his concern about those who are returning after their service to our country and coming up with a good idea and being persistent.    Thank you very much, Mr. McGovern. Appreciate it.    Mr. Visclosky. One, I just appreciate your participation on the committee.    And in reference to Mr. Young, I think all of us are here because we had wonderful families and great mentors. And I continue to recollect a question I received from a middle school student a couple of years ago, and she got a gold star, because I had never been asked that question in 30 years. And she says, ``Which Member of Congress do you deal with the most?'' And I said, ``Oh, that is easy. Bill Young. He is a Republican from Florida.''    And normally I would never addendum the Republican part, but I have a reasonably Democratic district. And it led to a wonderful discussion, is that contrary to what people see in the institution, there are very serious, decent people trying to move this country forward. And certainly you are following in his footsteps.    So appreciate your concern and your participation today.    Mr. Visclosky. No. No.    Mr. Visclosky. Chairman.    Mr. Visclosky. I would just interject, thank you for thanking the committee. It doesn't always happen, but it was the right thing to do, so it was the easy thing to do.    I would agree with you on the need of infrastructure. We had a Naval Reserve center in Gary, Indiana, on the largest body of freshwater on the planet Earth. That Naval Reserve base closed because the Navy could get very little equipment under the bridge on Lake Street in Gary, Indiana. And ultimately that facility was closed because of infrastructure within the city itself.    So appreciate your concern, and we will do our best.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Visclosky. I appreciate the Members' attendance as well, and would point out additionally that the idea of holding a Members-only hearing, which was a matter of course many years ago, was a very good one from an institutional standpoint as well, to allow Members, particularly those who have not served in the institution for a long period of time, knowledge of how we interact with them. And the fact is they can have input into the appropriations process. Too often it has been, I think, observed as an insular process. That is certainly not the case with the Defense Subcommittee.    But do appreciate the great attendance today, because that is not the norm usually.    Mr. Visclosky. And just mentioned that General Rodriguez, when he was testifying before us, suggested that there is a significant need--and you mentioned AFRICOM----    Mr. Visclosky . For the Joint Vessel. Thank you for your testimony. Because we do have a number of Members here, I would point out that besides the water, we do have coffee available.    Thank you very much.    Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Chair, I would simply say the best for last.    And also, I add my congratulations on your son.    Mr. Visclosky. And thank you for his service.
