    Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for conducting this hearing.    Mr. Weiss, a key element of the economic crisis in Puerto Rico is its impact on Puerto Rico health care and the system. Since passage of the ACA, the Secretary of HHS has used her existing discretionary authority to interpret most of the ACA as not applying to Puerto Rico and the territories. The territories, therefore, have no exchanges, no premium support, no coverage mandates, and no standards for health insurance plans. Yet the ACA's health insurance provider tax still applies to the territories.    Is it logical that the Administration uses its interpretive authority to relieve the territories of the benefits of the ACA, but it declines to use its interpretive authority to relieve them of the ACA's burdens? And do you foresee any relief for the island?    Mr. Clay. Yes, and I am glad to hear that it is on your radar because, apparently, relief is needed.    One other question. We have heard that the consequences of a comprehensive debt restructuring for Puerto Rico would be far reaching and drive up the cost of borrowing for Puerto Rico in the long term, making sustainable economic development unlikely for the island. Will the enactment of debt restructuring for Puerto Rico result in increased borrowing costs for the island?    Mr. Clay. So you don't see the costs being driven up for borrowing?    Mr. Clay. I see. I would like to yield to my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Gutierrez, the remaining time.
