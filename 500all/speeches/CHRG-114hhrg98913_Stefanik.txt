    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Dr. Parker, for your testimony. Mr. Wainstein, good to see you again. You and I served in the White House together.    Ms. Stefanik. I am excited to be able to connect with you.    I wanted to talk about the report's comments on the rapid development and employment of developmental Ebola vaccines, which was, quote, ``a remarkable achievement.'' But the report also noted that the general medical countermeasurement development is very risk averse and is not focused on innovation. Can you talk about what some of the lessons learned from the development of the Ebola vaccination and how we can improve how our MCM development, how we can improve that?    Ms. Stefanik. So are increased public-private partnerships a way we can improve that? How can we better employ public-private partnerships?    Ms. Stefanik. Mr. Wainstein, do you have anything to add?    Ms. Stefanik. Great.    Well, I have 1 minute left. Can you elaborate on possible incentives that could be used to improve public-private partnerships? So we understand this is a way to bring innovation to the table, but what specific incentives should we put into place?    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you. My time has expired.
