    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the panel for their testimony.    I understand that NHTSA is thinking about future regulations requiring manufacturers to submit a safety assessment letter. Do you think that the safety assessment letter, if required, would preempt state laws and regulations regarding design and performance of autonomous vehicles?    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you. In your view, would inconsistent state laws and regulations, I know you addressed this somewhat. Would inconsistent state laws and regulations related to the design and performance of autonomous vehicles hinder innovation in this lifesaving technology? How do we ensure that state laws and regulations on self-driving cars are uniform and consistent? And is there a role for Congress to play?
