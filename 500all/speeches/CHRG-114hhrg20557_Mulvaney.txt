    Mr. Mulvaney. I appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Bailey, I don't want to appear to be beating up on you, but I don't know if you are--the coincidence of your being here today, we just had a hearing this morning regarding TSA, which I think is in your department, isn't it?    Mr. Mulvaney. Okay. That didn't go very well. They weren't very happy. The subject matter of the hearing--were you here for that?    Mr. Mulvaney. The ----    Mr. Mulvaney. Okay. The subject of the hearing was some of the issues that we have been facing with whistleblowers and so forth. We had two folks here who feel like they had been mistreated, and I had some stories from my district about folks--and I am not laying blame because I know that is not your department, but that was the subject matter of this morning's hearing is how could TSA be run a little bit better. And I listened to what the chairman had to say about DHS, what you had to say about DHS, and, again, I can't blame you because you have only been there for, what, 3 months or something like that?    Mr. Mulvaney. And I get that. So I guess if I wanted to skip all of the rhetoric and get down to the bottom line, when is it going to get better at DHS? You all are last. When can we expect you to, say, be in the top half judged by your own employees' feedback on what kind of place this is to work? Top half by when?    Mr. Mulvaney. And, Ms. Bailey, again, I don't want to cut you off, that is fine. That is what we call rhetoric. That is not really--everybody says that. Everybody says it is a critical thing--everybody says the same thing now. At NASA and DOL and HUD, it is actually working. They made it a priority and they have listened to the people. Everybody uses words we have had town hall meetings with our employees. We get that, okay, and that is the right thing to do. But our question is when is it actually going to work? All right.    So let's pretend that we are not a congressional hearing and you are a private company. You are working with Google and you are the human resources chairman at Google, and everybody and Google hates working at Google. And you come into the board of directors and you say, okay, here is what we are going to do to fix it. We are going to do our town hall meetings and we are going to do all these wonderful things. And we turn to you and say, okay, when will it get better? What is your answer?    Mr. Mulvaney. How did you all do on the percentage of employees who had a positive thing to say about the honesty and integrity of leadership? The average across the whole system is 50. How did you all do?    Mr. Mulvaney. Probably worse than 50? Maybe? Probably? I don't have the numbers in front of me. But again, you are last, and if that is average, it is fair to say that you are last. And again, we are not trying to beat up on you. All we want to know is when is it going to get better? And just let us know. If it is a year, that is fine, if it is 3 years, that is fine, but I will let you know the next question is, okay, if you tell us it is going to be 3 years, what is the penalty for when it isn't? Because at some point--in fact, the gentlemen who were here this morning, very insightful, down-to-earth guys, they said, look, the only way it is going to get better at TSA is when we have accountable leadership. That is it, period, end of story.    So my question is when are we going to have accountable leadership? And if we don't, who pays the price? Because right now, I think the people who are paying the price, at TSA at least, are the employees and the public, which that is a really bad group to have to pay the price. The people who are running the organization at DHS and TSA are not paying the price. The people who work there are paying the price. The people they are supposed to serve are paying the price.    And we are going to try to turn that upside down to where the people who pay the price for failure are the people who are responsible for failure. At TSA, the people who wait in line to get through the security are not the ones who are not doing their job. In fact, what we heard today, and if you believe them--and I tend to do it--is the folks who actually work there on the line. The folks meeting face-to-face with the public are not the folks who are not doing their job. It is the folks, no offense, at your level and higher who are not doing their job. And what we are interested in is trying to create a system where the people who are screwing up are the people who pay the price and not the people who are sort of the victims or the folks who are ending up on the short end of the stick.    So my question to you before my time and out is, give us a date. When will you all get better?    Mr. Mulvaney. Okay. That is great. And I look forward to the hearing next year, and if you are not last here, I will be the first to congratulate you. I would love to see you in the most-improved categories like DOL and HUD.    I am sorry. I didn't want to focus on the negative, but we did just have this hearing this morning. But if you are last here or you haven't made--you know, if you are next-to-last, this hearing might be less fun than it was this year.    Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman.
