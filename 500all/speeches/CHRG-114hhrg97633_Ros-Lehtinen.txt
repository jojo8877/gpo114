    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you.    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Be afraid. Thank you so much, ladies. Thank you for your testimony, and I apologize that I came late.    So Ms. Davis, I wanted to ask you if you could give all of us late arrivals an overview about what your very interesting institute is doing. How do you gauge success? What are the metrics that you use to know that you are doing what you seek to achieve? So I apologize, but I am so interested in your work.    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. And in the 10 years, excuse me, that you have had the institute and you presented this, have you seen a marked improvement? I know I have got three granddaughters, 6, 3, and 1----    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen . And sometimes I am just appalled by the shows that they watch.    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. And they are supposedly on, you know, great kids-oriented stations.    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. And it is just such a lopsided view of women's roles in the world.    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. And then whip up another princess.    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. And the filmmakers and the TV show makers, they will realize that they have got a wonderful audience there. I mean, it will be good for their intake and box-office hits----    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen . And the ratings for TV shows, because parents are very well aware, not just moms, dads too----    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen . They are very aware of the gender disparities that their kids are subjected to.    Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. So thank you for what you are doing, and thank you for the excellent research that backs up what you are saying. And I think that you will be seeing the fruit of your labors coming up in the coming years. I congratulate all three of you. Thank you so much for having this hearing, Mr. Royce. I am sorry that I came late. Thank you.
