    Mrs. Ellmers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our panel. Mr. Kennedy, I have a couple question--or, actually, I have one question. Mr. Long asked my other question. My colleague from Missouri was hitting on some of the rural issues, and I would like to follow up on a couple of those as well. Since FirstNet is proposing a nationwide and State and regional approach as potential paths for network acquisition, I am concerned with how this affects the rural carriers in limiting their abilities to grow as well. They have smaller service territories, and I am afraid that they are going to get cut out of the process.    In addition, there is no clear incentive for large carriers to partner with the small providers to serve the rural communities. Large carriers lack presence in the--and experience in these rural areas, and the smaller carriers are there. How can--how is this process going to move forward, and, you know, how is FirstNet going to ensure that the effective and efficient creation of the network in rural areas is provided?    Mrs. Ellmers. Um-hum.    Mrs. Ellmers. Um-hum.    Mrs. Ellmers. Um-hum.    Mrs. Ellmers. Um-hum.    Mrs. Ellmers. Um-hum.    Mrs. Ellmers. Um-hum.    Mrs. Ellmers. Great. Thank you, Mr. Kennedy. I yield back the remainder of my time, or if anybody wants it, you know, I have got about 2 minutes left.
