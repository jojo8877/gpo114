    Mr. Castro. Thank you, Chairman, and thank each of you for offering your testimony today.    Welcome to Washington. I know you all are here frequently.    A special welcome to Major General Wilson, who is in from San Antonio, Texas, Lackland Air Force Base. We are very proud of the work you all are doing there.    Let me ask you all a question about training people in cybersecurity in our country because this issue and the need for that skill is only going to become more pronounced in the coming years.    This Congress is in the process of taking up our big education reauthorization bill for example, ESEA . What programs in our school should we be expanding or growing, not only in our high schools, but also in our colleges, to prepare more students to take on roles in cybersecurity and so that you all have a pipeline of qualified people who can take on these jobs, a job that is becoming more in demand not just in the military or in government, but also in the private sector? And I will open it up.    Mr. Castro. Sure.    Mr. Castro. Thank you very much. I yield back.    Mr. Wilson of South Carolina. Thank you, Congressman Castro.    We now proceed to Congressman Doug Lamborn of Colorado.
