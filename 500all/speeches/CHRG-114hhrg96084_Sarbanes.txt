    Mr. Sarbanes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank all of you for your testimony. Ms. Martinez and Mr. Wilson, I wanted to ask this question. Obviously in the STEM arena we want to make sure that the academic curriculum that is offered in the classroom for young people in that K-12 space is as rigorous and holistic as it can possibly be. But I am also interested in the opportunities to connect young people with the experiences outside the classroom, in a sense, get them out of the classroom in various ways so maybe their horizons are broadened and they can see the connection to that pipeline opportunity that exists.    So if each of you could just very briefly comment on that idea of how we get young people in the K-12 space out of the classroom and connected to these career horizons, that would be helpful.    Mr. Sarbanes. Thank you.    Mr. Sarbanes. OK.    Mr. Sarbanes. Great. Thank you. I yield back.
