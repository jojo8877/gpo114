    Dr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Very interesting. I appreciate each of you being here today. The questioning has been very, very helpful in your answers.    Dr. Michaels, let me just begin real quickly with you. I am assuming it is correct for us to say that carbon dioxide can have positive impact on vegetation and crops.    Dr. Hice. OK. With that, can you elaborate somewhat on how the positive externalities such as this are insufficiently modeled in the integrated assessment models?    Dr. Hice. OK.    Dr. Hice. OK. So what is the outcome of not including some of this in the SCC?    Dr. Hice. Right, in the models and so forth. If it is not included, what is the outcome? What are we going to get?    Dr. Hice. OK. Well, keep your mike on. Let me go back to the Circular A-4.    Dr. Hice. There were some questions on this a while ago, and of course, the discount rates of 3 and 7 percent were supposed to be used, and it says, as I understand it, that if others are appropriate, that they can be used in addition to the 3 and the 7 percent.    So was there a violation? Just explain.    Dr. Hice. All right. So there is a difference between it being properly adhered to and violating.    Dr. Hice. OK.    Dr. Hice. Right.    Dr. Hice. Right. So it is pretty clear.    Dr. Hice. Mr. Segal, did you want to respond?    Dr. Hice. Right.    Dr. Hice. While you are going, just keep elaborating. Didn't this put some of the agencies in a difficult position? I mean we've got what was put out for them to follow is violated, and now in place of 3 and 7, we've got 2\1/2\, 3 percent, whatever.    Dr. Hice. This puts agencies though in an ethical and difficult situation.    Dr. Hice. Ten seconds. Do you have something else?    Dr. Hice. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. All right. Before I ask the last set of questions, I want to thank you for spending 2 hours of your time with us. I know it has been fascinating for you.    Mr. Lowenthal, do you have a motion to add something to the record.
