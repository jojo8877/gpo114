    Mr. Marino. The Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law will come to order.    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare recesses of the Committee at any time. We welcome everyone to today's hearing on Nexus Issues: Legislative Hearing on H.R. 2315, the ``Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2015;'' H.R. 1643, the `Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of 2015;'' and H.R. 2584, the ``Business Activity Tax Simplification Act of 2015.''    I will now recognize myself for an opening statement.    I came to Congress with certain core principles that guide my work in Washington. One is that we should aim for less government regulation not more. That is why we are pleased to hold this legislative hearing. With all the focus on Washington, it is easy to forget the burdens that can flow from state capitals. That is especially true when discussing taxation of interstate commerce.    I am a staunch supporter of states' rights in the principles of federalism, but I believe states should be sovereign within their borders only. I have become concerned when states trying to tax or regulate beyond their borders. Unfortunately, this is happening with greater regularity and it has necessitated the three bills we are examining at this hearing.    Today, employees who travel across state lines for work face a myriad of crushing income tax laws. This is true even if they work in the state for just a single day. The complexity and variation of different state laws places a significant burden on the ability of businesses to deploy their workforces. Small businesses, in particular, are especially effected.    It is also draining on the employees who must hire accountants, at their own expense, to handle the paperwork for multiple state tax jurisdictions. The Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2015 addresses this problem. It creates a bright line, 30-day threshold before a state can impose income tax liability on a nonresident temporarily working in the state. This minimizes compliance burdens on both workers and employers so they can get back to work.    Just as states target nonresident workers for taxation, they also target nonresident businesses. An increasing number of states used the concept of economic presence to subject nonresident companies to state income tax simply because those companies have customers in the state. For example, New Jersey has impounded trucks delivering boats to customers in New Jersey, because the state demands that out-of-state manufacturers pay income tax to New Jersey. Similarly, Massachusetts demands income tax from out-of-state businesses if they deliver trucks which carry through the state on their own way to businesses from elsewhere.    The Business Activity Tax Simplification Act, known as BATSA, requires an entity to be physically present in the state for more than 14 days in a year because it can be subject to state's business activity tax. It also sets a clear guideline on what constitutes a physical presence in order to reduce uncertainty.    The third bill before us is H.R. 1643, the ``Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of 2015.'' This sets forth the purchase of digital goods and services to prevent multiple taxation of cross border sales.    Every one of these bills is bipartisan. It is a testament to the soundness of their policies. I also commend the sponsors of these bills, many of whom serve on the Judiciary Committee. I note particularly Mr. Bishop, Ranking Member Johnson, and Mr. Cicilline, who are original cosponsors of the Mobile Workforce bill.    I look forward to hearing from our distinguished panel of witnesses.    It is now my pleasure to recognize the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, for his opening statement.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    It is now my pleasure to recognize the Chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, Mr. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, for his opening statement.    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Chairman.    It is now my pleasure to recognize the Judiciary Committee Ranking Member, Mr. Conyers of Michigan, for his opening statement.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    Without objection, all the Member's opening statement will be made part of the record.    We have a very distinguished panel with us today, and I will begin by swearing in our witnesses before introducing them.    So would you please rise and raise your right hand please?    Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?    Let the record reflect that the witnesses have responded in the affirmative.    Thank you. Please be seated.    I will introduce the witnesses for today.

Each of the witness written statements will be entered into the record in its entirety. I ask that each witness summarize his or her testimony in 5 minutes or less. To help you stay within the time, there is a timing light in front of you. The light will switch from green to yellow, indicating that you have 1 minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns red, it indicates that the witness' 5 minutes have expired. And I know that we are so, and you are so, intent on making your statements and we really don't pay attention to the lights. We don't pay attention to them up here. So, what I am going to do is diplomatically just give a little tap to let you know that your time has expired and could you please wrap it up quickly.    Thank you.    Okay. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Norquist for his 5-minute statement.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Rosen.                   McDERMOTT WILL & EMERY LLP    Mr. Marino. Thank you, sir.    Mr. Lindholm?    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Leaman.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    Mr. Carpenter?    Mr. Marino. Thank you, sir.    The Chair now recognizes Commissioner Magee.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    Mr. Marino. Mr. Crippen?    Mr. Marino. Sir, could you please pull your mike a little closer if it is not on?    Mr. Marino. Much better.    Mr. Marino. Thank you, sir.    We will now move into the period of the Congress men and women asking questions and I will recognize myself for 5 minutes.    Mr. Carpenter, I am going to ask you to put your Constitutional hat on here. Does Congress have the clear Constitutional authority to enact Digital Goods and Services legislation? Why or why not?    Mr. Marino. Does anyone on the panel disagree with that interpretation that the legislators have Constitutional authority?    This is a first. This is good. This is a first.    Mr. Marino. Shortly, thank you.    Mr. Leaman, you described what not only a business has to go through because of the way the law is now, and you describe also what an employee has to go through. I think you said one individual had 50 W-2s. Could you expand upon that a little bit? Explain to us and to the public what the corporation has to go through step-by-step and what the, more importantly, the individual has 50 W-2s has to go through even if he or she is preparing them himself or herself.    Mr. Marino. So, in essence, if an employee worked in each of the 50 states of the United States, would he or she have to be cutting, if they owe taxes, checks to each of those 50 states?    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    Mr. Marino. Yes.    Mr. Norquist, obviously I support this legislation but I am going to play devil's advocate here and use my state as an example in my minute and a half. My district goes all the way to the Eastern New York. Say there is a trucking company right on the other side of the New York border and they are going to deliver something to Ohio. And they drive through the State of Pennsylvania. They don't fuel-up in Pennsylvania, they cross the line right into Ohio, and deliver their merchandise. Why should Pennsylvania not be able to tax that entity, that company, that person, for the use of the road?    Mr. Marino. Thank you. My time has expired.    The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member from Georgia, Mr. Johnson.    Mr. Marino. Without objection.    Mr. Marino. The Chair now recognizes the Chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, Congressman Goodlatte.    Mr. Marino. The Chair recognizes the Ranking Member of the full Judiciary Committee, Congressman Conyers.    Mr. Marino. Without objection, so ordered.    Mr. Marino. Yes.    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Congressman Issa.    Mr. Marino. The Chair now recognizes the Congressman from the State of Washington, Ms. DelBene.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    The Chair now recognizes the Congressman from Michigan, Mr. Bishop.    Mr. Marino. Without objection, so ordered.    Mr. Marino. The Chair now recognizes the Congressman from New York, Mr. Jeffries.    Mr. Marino. Without objection, so ordered.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.

Now, we have one more questioner and I didn't know if you had to get to where you are going instantly.    Mr. Marino. All right. Thank you, sir.    Now, the gentleman from Georgia, Congressman Collins, is next.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    Seeing all the Members on the dais, this concludes today's hearing. I want to thank all the witnesses for attending. I want to thank the people in the gallery for attending.
