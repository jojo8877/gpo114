    Mr. Rohrabacher. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I remember when the Space Station was first approved. It only won by one vote in this Committee, one vote. Boy, I'm glad I voted for it. Don't disappoint me. Don't disappoint me now.    Does anyone here know the level of CO<INF>2</INF> that is in the atmosphere of the Space Station? You have an internal atmosphere. What element do we put CO<INF>2</INF> in? There's a lot of talk about CO<INF>2</INF> in the planet now. What does CO<INF>2</INF> do in the Space Station?    Mr. Rohrabacher. How does that compare to the CO<INF>2</INF> that we have in our atmosphere here?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Have there been any health-related problems, this increased level of CO<INF>2</INF> that astronauts breathe in during their time at the Space Station as compared to what they would breathe in here?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Because we are actually exhaling CO<INF>2</INF> all the time, right? So we have to be--if you're in an enclosed environment, be very concerned with what the human body itself is exhaling.    In terms of the future of Space Station, do we have plans to expand, put different elements onto the Space Station at this point?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Does the----    Mr. Rohrabacher. The Bigelow Company has actually invested a considerable amount of money in developing a new concept for space habitat, the inflatables. Is there any use of this technology?    Mr. Rohrabacher. And it might also be cheaper than the traditional way of building a space station which is something we should be concerned about.    Let me just note two things, one is that orbital debris continues to be and always was and is an expanding concern. I believe that this is something NASA should look at, not just in terms of Space Station, but we should be thinking about international cooperative effort to just deal with the debris problem. That's something we need to, this Committee should be dealing with at least in the time ahead.    And second and last of all, let me just note that your report on your cooperation with Russia during this time period when there are, how do you say, frictions going on between the United States and Russia, I think demonstrates a very wonderful aspect of space and that is once you get up there, you look back down on the Earth and some of those problems don't seem as important or we're able to put it in perspective, and I'm happy to hear that we are and that the Russians are putting these areas of friction in perspective to the point that we can work together and create a better world while we're doing it. So thank you very much for demonstrating that to all of us.
