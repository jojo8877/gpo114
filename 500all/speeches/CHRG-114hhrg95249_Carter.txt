    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you all for being here. The hour is late. I know, if you're like me, you're tired. But let me, again, thank you for being here, and thank you specifically--it's never been the question in my mind whether or not it was--that it was duplicate material that you found, but, instead, the point is you found it.    So I want to talk about that specifically. What prompted you--were you asked to look for it?    Mr. Carter. OK. So that's what was the impetus for you to start looking for it.    Mr. Carter. And you found it, as you testified, in, what, 15 days?    Mr. Carter. But the point still remains is that you found emails that we have been--that previous testimony had said that were lost and couldn't be found. That is the point, correct?    Mr. Carter. OK.    Mr. Carter. I understand. I understand. I'm with you on that.    All right. I want to talk about standard operating policy, which--I'm in business, so that's important to me, that we are following SOP and best practices. I mean, all of that type of thing is very important.    Where the emails were being stored, was it in somewhat of a unique place? Or was it standard, that you would expect for them to be here?    Mr. Carter. Right where you would expect them to be.    Mr. Carter. Anyway. Let me ask you this. When someone's hard drive crashes, who do they report it to? I mean, obviously, you had to have a new computer, right?    Mr. Carter. You had to put in a requisition that, hey, my hard drive has crashed, I got to have a new--was that done?    Mr. Carter. So everything was followed, right procedures. And that matches the timeframe with which Ms. Lerner is saying that her hard drive did indeed crash?    Mr. Carter. OK. So nothing unusual in that respect.    Mr. Carter. OK.    I also heard testimony that more than one hard drive had crashed and that it was--isn't that kind of unusual? I mean, all of a sudden, you've got a slew of hard drives crashing right around here.    Mr. Carter. Again, just coincidence, I'm sure.    But, nevertheless, again, thank you for being here tonight. Thank you for reporting this and for finding this. You know, I would congratulate you on being great inspectors and detectives, but it sounds like all you did was ask the right question.    Mr. Carter. Great. Thank you.    And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
