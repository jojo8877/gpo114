    Ms. Clarke. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I would like to thank our witnesses for their testimony this morning.    In addition to serving on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I also serve on the Small Business Committee in our House, and our small business community lists fear of patent litigation as one of the biggest issues they face. So I am pleased that we are taking up this issue today.    Frequently, patent trolls target end users of patented technology, such as small, local businesses who have simply purchased or use off-the-shelf products like a wireless router or scanner. These small businesses often lack expertise in patent law, and have few resources. When faced with the cost of defending even perfectly reasonable behavior, they find it is cheaper just to make a payment to settle the case.    Ms. Ranieri, to what extent do patent trolls target the little guy, small businesses, startup, and mom and pop establishments, and what are some examples of everyday products that patent trolls are now claiming infringe their intellectual property?    Ms. Clarke. Let me ask you then, what options do small businesses or startup companies currently have when they receive a vague threatening demand letter, and do patent holders, other than trolls, routinely target end users? Could there be legitimate reasons to send demand letters to end users?    Ms. Clarke. What options.    Ms. Clarke. Can you take a moment and sort of speak to the cost of patent litigation, and the feasibility of a small business mounting an adequate defense?    Ms. Clarke. Um-hum.    Ms. Clarke. Um-hum.    Ms. Clarke. I thank you. And I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
