    Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to begin by thanking my colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee, for having a moment of silence in connection with the tragedy that just occurred, and I'm grateful to her for that.    This is an amazing set of witnesses here. And I'm trying to determine after the few responses that have been given so far whether we're moving ahead or just merely providing options. And I think I'll start with Ms. Wolf.    What is your view, is this just something we've got to find out if it works better and is more efficient and we're at a preliminary stage of development where we're not really sure yet?    Mr. Conyers. So it's a good beginning we're off to.    Ms. Alexenko, your testimony, of course, is gripping whenever it's given by yourself. What do you think right now candidly about the Rapid DNA testing? Do you have hopes for it, or do you have some secret reservations about it? Please tell us.    Mr. Conyers. Thank you.    Mr. Conyers. Thank you so much.    Ms. Hess, with your background with the FBI, where do you think the future lies, and what does it have in store for us with the Rapid DNA machines?    Mr. Conyers. Well, I thank you all. I think this is an important hearing. And I will look forward to seeing some improvement in this.    I presume DNA machines are admissible as evidence in criminal trials. Is there any question about that?    Mr. Conyers. Do you agree that Rapid DNA machines can be used as evidence in criminal trials?    Mr. Conyers. Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
