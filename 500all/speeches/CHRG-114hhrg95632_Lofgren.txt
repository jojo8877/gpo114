    Ms. Lofgren. First, I would like to welcome all of the witnesses to the hearing today, but I especially want to welcome members of the Steinle family and to extend my heartfelt condolences to you. As a parent, I can only imagine what you are going through, and any time an innocent person is lost to violence, I think it is important that we all stop and consider what steps could we take, what policies and processes, procedures, and rules, and laws could be altered so that we would have a safer community, so that that tragedy would not occur.    And so, it is important the process that we are going through at this time. A hearing like this offers Members and the public an opportunity to learn more about the issue, and I hope that we can work together collaboratively to address some of the problems we were sent here to Washington to solve.    Now, I am eager to hear what each witness has to say. I must note that last night Chairman Goodlatte and I testified before the Rules Committee on H.R. 3009, a bill that has already been decided is the answer apparently to this. And I would note that if 3009 had been enacted into law, it would not have had any impact on these circumstances that resulted in the death of your daughter. In addition to that, major law enforcement associations, like the Fraternal Order of Police, the Major Counties Sheriffs Association, and others are telling us that that bill would actually make us less safe, and they all oppose that bill.    I do think that the testimony of the police chief of Dayton, Ohio I hope will be instructive because I have not heard a single person who suggests that it was wise, appropriate, or even legal for the sheriff in San Francisco to have released the individual who is charged with killing your daughter. Having said that, there are police agencies around the United States who believe that it makes our communities less safe to inquire as to the immigration status in every case. For example, the domestic violence organizations have contacted us to say that if there is a call for a domestic violence situation and the individuals who are calling know that they and everyone in their household will be interrogated as to their status, a family where there is mixed status will not call for domestic violence. So we have to be mindful of those issues, the entirety of the situation that we face.    I would ask unanimous consent to put into the record a bipartisan letter that was sent to appropriators just 4 months ago signed by 162 Members of Congress talking about the importance of the Byrne JAG and COPS grants for policing in this country.    Ms. Lofgren. And noting that it is those very grants that would be removed by the legislation that is before the Congress later today. And I would also ask unanimous consent to enter into the record letters in opposition to H.R. 3009 by the Major Counties Sheriffs' Association; the Fraternal Order of Police; the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force; the League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors.    Ms. Lofgren. With that, I would just say that I will listen with great interest to all of our witnesses, but especially to Mr. Steinle, and hopefully I will have a chance to meet you after this hearing and your family as well. As you know, Congresswoman Pelosi and I sent a letter to the Attorney General and the Department of Homeland Security just a few days ago to explore how could it be that you would send a person who should have been deported to a jurisdiction for a warrant that was 20 years old that clearly there was not going to be a prosecution.    And oddly enough, I mean, this individual was deported in 1994, in 1997, in 1998, in 2003. And in none of those instances did this ancient warrant prevent him from being deported. I mean, he was also convicted repeatedly of felony reentry after removal, and served 16 years in Federal prison for that crime, and he just kept trying to get in. And I want to give credit to our Border Patrol because every time he tried to come back in, they caught him, which is exactly what they should do, and he was prosecuted.    So we need to examine all of this and knowing that none of it can bring your beautiful daughter back, but hopefully we will be able to improve the situation as really a tribute to your loss.    And with that, I would yield back, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Lofgren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I should have asked earlier for unanimous consent to enter Ranking Member Conyers' statement into the record. And I would also ask unanimous consent to enter into the record 137 statements, including from the Archbishop of San Francisco, Church World Services, the Methodists, and 134 other organizations on this subject.*---------------------------------------------------------------------------    *Note: The material referred to is not printed in this hearing record but is on file with the Subcommittee. Also, see ``Rep. Lofgren Submissions for the Record'' at:      http://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/      ByEvent.aspx?EventID=103781.    Ms. Lofgren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I appreciated hearing from all the witnesses. Sheriff Jones, you mentioned that no sheriff would come and take the position of Chief Biehl. I would like to ask unanimous consent to put into the record a letter from the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force opposing H.R. 3009 signed by a number of law enforcement officials, including Sheriff Mark Curran from Illinois, Sheriff Tony Estrada from Arizona, Sheriff Leon Lott from South Carolina, Sheriff William McCarthy from Iowa, Sheriff Margaret Mims from Fresno, and Sheriff Lupe Valdez from Texas.**---------------------------------------------------------------------------    **Note: The material referred to was previously submitted. See page 22.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Ms. Lofgren. Also I would like to ask unanimous consent to place in the record a letter from the Major County Sheriffs' Association opposing the idea of removing grant funding as a mechanism to enforce anything.***---------------------------------------------------------------------------    ***Note: The material referred to was previously submitted. See page 18.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Ms. Lofgren. You know, as we seek efforts to make our communities safer, we do not want to make it more dangerous. And, Chief Biehl, your testimony I thought was very interesting. In your op-ed recently you said that crime in Dayton dropped by nearly 22 percent after you engaged in your new community policing effort, and that serious property crime dropped almost 15 percent.    Now, why do you think this happened? Was it community trust? And have these favorable crime reduction figures continued or not?    Ms. Lofgren. Now, again, there has been a lot of discussion about detention and whether that is constitutional and citing one particular case. However, there are a number of cases, and rather than go into all of them here, I would ask unanimous consent to place a summary of a series of cases, Federal cases, that have found that you cannot hold somebody on a civil matter at the request of ICE absent a warrant or something else.    Ms. Lofgren. And I think that is why sheriffs all across the United States, whether or not their communities say they are ``sanctuary cities,'' have been reluctant to do this. And that is why the Administration has gone to this Priority Enforcement Program because it does not violate anybody's constitutional rights if you ask to be notified before you release somebody.    And what we have heard from ICE is if you have got a serious character like this guy in San Francisco, they will get there, and they will pick him up, and they will take him away and deport him, which is what should have happened in this case. Actually he should never have been sent to San Francisco in the first place.    I am wondering whether you have any objection, Chief Biehl, or whether your community would have any objection to the Priority Enforcement Program that requires notification so that ICE can come and remove people who are priorities for enforcement, who are serious criminals.    Ms. Lofgren. I would note also, and I see that my time is almost expiring, that when someone is booked into a jail, their fingerprints are taken. And those fingerprints, I mean, of everyone.    Ms. Lofgren. Immigrants, undocumented, legal, American citizens. Those fingerprints are shared with the Federal Government and made part of the database. And that has not been changed at all, has it, Sheriff? No. And I do not think there is any confusion that that interferes with community policing or building trust with the community. Have you heard that?    Ms. Lofgren. Mr. Chairman, I am hopeful that we can hone in on the need to make sure that the ability to remove dangerous criminals by ICE is enhanced, and that we do not get diverted by disagreements over overall immigration policy because I believe that we can have the ability to come together to reach consensus in a way that would be a very positive outcome.    And with that, my time has expired, and I yield back.    Ms. Lofgren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I first would like to ask unanimous consent to put in the record the priorities for removal.    Ms. Lofgren. There have been several comments made her that are just not correct. The priorities for removal are Priority 1A, B, C, D, and E, and Priority 2A and B. And what that is, terrorism, gang, any felony as well as any aggravated felony. Under Priority 2, and this is equal with 1, three or more misdemeanors other than traffic, and significant misdemeanors, which includes a single DUI, no matter when that offense was included. Those are all priorities for removal.    I would just note that no system is perfect, and clearly there was a failure here in San Francisco. I mean, there is no question about that. I think your question about the warrant is a good one and one we ought to explore. One of the reasons I think every jurisdiction has a multiplicity of bench warrants that have been issues, and there generally is no process for going back and taking a look at old bench warrants to see whether they ought to be dismissed. Maybe that is part of the answer.    On the other hand, if the bench warrant was not for a drug offense but for a rape, you would not want that dismissed. So, you know, we need to sort through with some granularity to make sure that we are actually solving a problem and not creating new ones.    And I would just close with saying that although the system is far from perfect, it is often the case that individuals who have either no status or they gain status who commit an offense are the subject of enforcement action. In fat, I have met a number of people who are legal permanent residents of the United States who have lost their legal permanent residence because they have been convicted of a crime that allows them to be removed. So I am not saying it is perfect, but it is far from rare.    I think that as we move forward in this, we have plenty of questions and an opportunity to work together to make sure that this whole system works better for the safety of our community. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for recognizing me, and I yield back.
