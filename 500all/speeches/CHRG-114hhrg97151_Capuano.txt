    Mr. Capuano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I have heard a lot of interesting philosophical talking points this morning, but I have heard them before and I am sure I will hear them again and again and again and again. But I haven't heard too many figures. From the panel, it was one statistic, which is that there are fewer people with free checking than there used to be. My God, what a terrible crisis that is. People have to pay for a service. That is complete ruination to our system.    Yet some other statistics I have show some things from the day of Dodd-Frank, July 21, 2010. The Dow Jones was at 10,120.53. As of yesterday, it was 17,776.91, and today it is up a little more. That is a 76 percent increase and that is true about all the markets, Dow just being one, but it is true about S&P, NASDAQ, and all of them, all of them are.    The unemployment rate in July 2010 was 9.4 percent. The most recent one in June was 5.3 percent, the lowest it has been since before the crash. The average house price in July 2010 was $252,100. Today, as of May 2015, it is $337,000. That is $84,900 more, a 34 percent increase. The GDP in July 2010 was $14,784,000,000. Today, it is $16,288,000,000, a trillion five increase, a 10 percent increase.    Housing starts. In July 2010, there was 604,000 in calendar year 2014. It was 1,046--I am sorry--1,046,000, 442,000 more, 73 percent increase in housing starts. Total construction value also a 19 percent increase and on and on and on.    Could Dodd-Frank be better? Yes. As a matter of fact, I have a proposal, because I agree with some of my friends that too-big-to-fail, I think we did some good work, but I think we didn't go far enough. I would love some of my colleagues on the other side to join me in reinstituting Glass-Steagall. I voted against the repeal of Glass-Steagall. Join us. Bring it back. If you don't want to do that, join us in trying to deal with other issues.    I have a proposal, H.R. 888, that not a single Republican will join, yet it is supported by the community bankers, the people you say you care about. They are looking for a Republican co-sponsor. We can't find one.    And, by the way, it is not my idea. I simply took the idea of an economics professor from Boston University and a scholar at AEI who happened to be the former Chief Counsel to Ronald Reagan. Not my idea, but yet can't do it, can't touch it. We can only talk about repealing Dodd-Frank and how bad certain sections of it are.    Why don't we get to fixing the problems we have. I have had my fights with the CFPB. I have certainly had my fights with the SEC and the Fed. Mr. Garrett and I have a bill to deal with some of the issues we have with the Fed. Now, if Scott Garrett and I could agree on an issue, we can find common ground with everybody over there. But yet, it can't be done. Why? Because if you actually try to fix the problems you identify as opposed to pontificate about them, you don't get any points with the outside groups.    Fixing a problem is a problem in and of itself. We are here to pontificate and we do a heck of a good job. So for me, all very interesting, but numbers don't lie. The numbers are almost all good. Are there a few bad ones? Yes. Can we do better? Sure, we can. Are we going to do better by simply nitpicking at everything? Now, nitpicking is not a bad thing, but nitpicking is what you do once you have fixed your other problems. There has not been one substantive proposal to deal with too-big-to-fail from the other side, not one, yet we still love to complain about it.    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. I actually thought I wouldn't take the whole 5 minutes, but I am glad I did.
