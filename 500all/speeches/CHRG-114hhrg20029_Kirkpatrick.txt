    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you. Mr. O'Malia, I want to follow up on your comment that one-size-doesn't-fit-all in terms of capitalization. Can you give me an example of what you mean by that?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. I would appreciate that.    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. I would appreciate that. Has there ever been a situation where a market participant had insufficient capital, and if so, what happened?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Market participant.    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. But what really happens aside from that, I mean in impacts?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. But can you give me an example of where there was a market participant who did not have enough capital?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Any----    Mr. Lukken.--the prudential banking regulators would require you either to go out in the debt markets to raise more capital, or issue stock to raise more capital, but you would be out of compliance with prudentially regulated regulations that require a certain amount of minimum capital, and----    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. I guess what I am trying to find out what is a commonsense sort of approach to good capitalization? So you are basically saying it is in the hands of the regulators. I get that because of the regulations, but I am trying to find out are those regulations sensible, is there another standard for looking at what makes good capitalizations. That is what I am trying to get at.    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you. That is what I am after. And my time is running out, but I would appreciate more information on that. I will tell you that it has been my experience that, in crafting legislation and regulations, too many times we do think that one-size-fits-all, and it doesn't work. So I appreciate the panel's testimony.    I yield back.    The Chairman. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Kelly, for 5 minutes.
