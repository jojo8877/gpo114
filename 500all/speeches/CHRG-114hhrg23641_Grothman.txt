    Mr.  Grothman. I may cover some territory you have already covered a little bit. But I want, in general, and this is a question maybe for Mr. Judd and Mr. Ting, in general, how effective do you believe the administration's commitment to border security has been? And I also want you compare it, because I am not a partisan person. I am under the impression that we were not getting a lot in the past administration either.    So I guess I would like to even change the question to say, how sincere has the commitment been both in this administration and the last administration to border security, which to me is just a basic part of being a country?    Mr.  Grothman. Okay, so I don't mean to put words in your mouth, but it seems to me that at least under the last two administrations, maybe the past three administrations, while the average American knows we have a Border Patrol and thinks we have a Border Patrol because we want to have our immigration laws obeyed, there has not been a commitment for many years in this country by powerful people who presumably ran and said that they wanted to enforce immigration laws.    For whatever reason, past administrations of both parties don't really seem to care that much for enforcing our immigration laws. I do not know what is going on in their head, but do you think that is an accurate statement?    Mr.  Grothman. Mr. Judd?    Mr.  Grothman. Okay. Thank you.    Before my final 10 seconds, I want to correct Mr. Ting.    I think there are a lot of Republicans who want to enforce the border, and I think a lot of us are very concerned about what happened under President Bush and don't want another person that is anybody like Bush representing our party in the future. Thank you.
