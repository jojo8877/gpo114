    Ms. Adams. Thank you, Chairman Walberg and Ranking Member Wilson, and I would also like to thank our witnesses for testifying today.    Before I get started, I want to just make a very simple point about the Department of Labor. One of their primary reasons for existence is to improve working conditions for working people. It is clear that the purpose of this rule is to improve the working conditions of some of our most vulnerable employees.    As we know, exposure to silica is a serious health hazard, and while many have pointed to reductions in silicosis as a reason to oppose this rule, I believe these generalizations are very misguided, especially for low-wage workers who are often workers of color.    Silica dust-related illnesses have a greater impact on low-income and ethnic minority groups than on the job populations, and it is especially true for the Latino community.    Dr. Melius, with that in mind, can you speak to the positive impact this rule will have on low-wage earners and communities of color who are disproportionately affected by silica-related illnesses?    Ms. Adams. Thank you, sir. It is your opinion that this is a step in the right direction in addressing racial health disparities?    Ms. Adams. In addition to saving many lives and reducing illnesses among workers who are exposed to silica dust, this rule will also create billions in benefits. Dr. Melius, can you explain on what some of those benefits will be and how they will play into the industry's ability to capture savings associated with safer and healthier employees?    Ms. Adams. Thank you very much, sir, I appreciate. Mr. Chairman, I am going to yield my time back.
