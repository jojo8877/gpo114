    Mrs. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to all of you for being here.    I wanted to follow up on the discussion on summer meals earlier and, to you, Mr. Storen, I know you have had some experience with this. What role can the electronic benefit transfer play? We know that the pilot program has been seen as effective and the issue really here, in addition to some others, I think, how do you bring that to scale? And what issues do you think need to be addressed?    Mrs. Davis. Right.    Mrs. Davis. Yes.    Mrs. Davis. Yes, oh, I appreciate that. I mean, we often talk about the educational loss in the summer and I have always wondered to what extent that is that kids are just basically hungry throughout the summer. And so even the kinds of games and toys and options they might have, which are maybe, you know, limited compared to a lot of other children who have pretty enriched summer experiences, they really aren't able to participate as well. Thank you. We need to really work on that.    One of the things we know about the participation of schools, I mean, generally speaking, 93 percent of school districts, I think, are exceeding the new nutrition standards. But for that smaller percentage that are not, what kind of trends do you see, and, I guess, to Ms. Bauscher, what stands out the most? We have talked about the need for flexibility, we have talked about the need for food that kids identify with, and that they feel more comfortable eating.    Are there some other issues that you see that really need to be addressed so that, for many of those districts, we are not just doing an overall waiver for them. I know for even San Diego Unified School District, there are some issues, and I am curious about where you see some of the trends. I mean, what is it that is holding people back?    Mrs. Davis. I am sorry, programs of?    Mrs. Davis. Oh, okay.    Ms. Bauscher.--to Mr. Storen's point so that the programs are easy to access. One of our policy requests or asks is for more money so that we can afford--    Mrs. Davis. Is technical assistance a major problem? Do schools need more help or support in trying to figure this out?    Mrs. Davis. Thank you.
