    Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank our witnesses for your testimony and appearance here today. It has been a very interesting discussion, obviously.    So I serve as the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and we oversee all of our R&D efforts, DARPA , and ONR , and others. And just in S&T directly, you know, the basic nature of S&T development means that several failures often proceed as successful technology. DOD culture, and acquisition processes, and congressional oversight are often risk-averse at best, and punish failures at worst. How can this culture be changed or mitigated, or should it?    Mr. Langevin. A follow-up question. What changes are needed to allow for a rapidly changing investment area such as cybersecurity, which I spend a lot of time on, where generations of technologies can pass within a single budget cycle, and to what extent do current budgeting processes impede the deployment or development of technologies?    Mr. Langevin. I know my time is expired, but that was an interesting question and response. I appreciate your thoughts. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Cook.
