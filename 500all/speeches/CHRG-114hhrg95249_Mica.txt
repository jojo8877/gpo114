    Mr. Mica. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for following up.    It looks like we've been lied to or at least misled. As recently as February 11, Commissioner Koskinen, the IRS Commissioner, came before us again, and he repeatedly Stated that the emails were not recoverable.    Now, they have known for some time that some of these were recoverable. Is that correct, Mr. George?    Mr. Mica. Is that true?    Mr. Mica. Well, the IRS consistently Stated from June 2, 2014, when Cate Duval identified the problem, till June 13, 2014, in a letter to the Finance Committee that the agency did everything possible to recover the emails.    But, in the meantime, you started your recovery when? 2014?    Mr. Mica. June 2014. Have they been made aware at all that there was some recovery underway?    Mr. Mica. They've been provided similar information, and yet, since then, they've been coming to us and most recently said, our experts said we had no way, they were unrecoverable.    That wouldn't be a Statement of fact. They knew otherwise, did they not?    Mr. Mica. OK.    The other thing, too, is, OK, you've found 32,000. We've been provided 24,000. And I understand we got those from other sources, other employees, not from the tapes.    And you found 32,000, did you say?    Mr. Mica. OK. So that means there's at least 8,000 we more than likely haven't seen. You haven't turned any of those over to us yet, have you?    Mr. Mica. OK. What is the process of getting those to us? You said you've got a software company to help separate them. What would you estimate the timeframe?    Mr. Mica. So you can get us--so there are about--I mean, this is simple math. There are about 8,000, wouldn't you say, that we probably wouldn't have access, because you've got--or we've got 24, you've got 32.    In addition, you said now you've found 2011 tapes 2 weeks ago. Is that correct?    Mr. Mica. What kind of volume do you think you've got there? What would a tape have? Any idea of the emails? Has that been looked at at all?    Mr. Mica. And you've found some tapes have been erased that you cited in your testimony of the ones that you were given in the previous batch?    Mr. Mica. Were they erased, or were they blank?    Mr. Mica. So we know that there are some tapes that either were blank or made blank, right?    Mr. Mica. Erased.    Mr. Mica. OK. And, again, how long will it take you to process the new tapes to get to us, do you think?    Mr. Mica. Did you say 424?    Mr. Mica. Holy Moses. Because the other was seven hundred----    Mr. Mica. And that produced the 32,774. So there could be a good volume of tapes that have never been seen with--I mean, there are a volume of tapes never seen, but they could contained a volume of emails never been seen. Is that possible?    Mr. Mica. OK.    Mr. Mica. Yes.    Mr. Mica. Well, Mr. Chairman, too, what concerns me is witnesses have come before us from IRS and have denied that some of these things existed, denied that they had knowledge. And I think that they have misled or lied to the Committee, and I think that should be taken under advice of counsel.    Yield back.
