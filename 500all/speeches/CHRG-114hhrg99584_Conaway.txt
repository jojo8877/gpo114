    Mr. Conaway. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, Chairman, Ranking Member, Ranking Member. I appreciate the witnesses being here today.    Americans enjoy the most affordable, most abundant, and the safest food and fiber supply of any developed nation in the world. They enjoy it in their pocketbooks, but they don't know why it happens. And the safest part of it is what you will hear from the witnesses today. I am excited about understanding the work that you do and the importance of protecting the safety of the food supply.    National security and agriculture are linked at the hip, at the shoulder, and elbow. You can't have one without the other. President Bush said that the nation that can feed itself is more secure than a nation that can't. And so an integral part of that is the safety of the food, not only what is grown in the United States, but what is grown outside the United States and brought in. And the role that you and your agencies play in making sure that continues to be the safest in the world is important. I am looking forward to hearing from each of you.    And with that, Mr. Chairman, Chairman, Ranking Member, Ranking Member, I yield back. Thank you.
