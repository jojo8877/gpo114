    Mr. Babin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Volz, in April of 2013, NOAA removed funding for three years of operations at the end of JPSS missions to keep the lifecycle cost of the program around $11 billion, two-part question. Even though JPSS-2 will be operational through 2028, operations, I see, are only funded through 2025. Is this a gimmick to hide the true cost of the program?    Mr. Babin. Okay. Are you anticipating no funding for a fully operational satellite program or are you anticipating that we will find more money after the satellite is airborne?    Mr. Babin. Yes.    Mr. Babin. Okay. Thank you. And then one other question for Mr. Clarke. Where did the space debris come from that has led to the degradation of our polar orbiting satellites?    Mr. Babin. Okay. And then Mr. Powner, how important is improving NOAA's supercomputing capabilities to mitigating a data gap?    Mr. Babin. Absolutely. Thank you.    Dr. Alexander MacDonald and Mr. Murphy, where does our supercomputing capacity rank relative to the rest of the world?    Mr. Babin. Okay. One other thing. Should NOAA be placing a higher priority on this?    Mr. Babin. Okay. Thank you.    One thing else. I am sorry. Do you feel budgetary pressures elsewhere in NOAA's budget prevent you from having access to the best resources?    Mr. Babin. Okay. Thank you. That is all. I yield back the rest of my time.
