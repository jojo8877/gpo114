    Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Administrator McCarthy, the Cancer Assessment Review Committee report on glyphosate published on April 29 and then removed on May 2 came to the same conclusion as other global regulatory bodies about the safety of a vital agricultural tool. The report also addressed several deficiencies with the International Agency for Research on Cancer's monogram from early 2015, which, as you know, came to a different conclusion on glyphosate than your agency's report.    I guess my first question, the Cancer Assessment Review Committee, they found that glyphosate is not a carcinogenic, is that correct?    Mr. Lucas. Found that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.    Mr. Lucas. Okay.    Mr. Lucas. Was this report marked final and signed by the scientists at the Cancer Assessment Review Committee who completed the report?    Mr. Lucas. But, Administrator, was the report dated October 1, 2015?    Mr. Lucas. My understanding is the document that was placed online----    Mr. Lucas. --on the 29th----    Mr. Lucas. --had been dated the October before, some months earlier, and I'm under the general impression that it was signed out to the--the memo was by the scientist----    Mr. Lucas. --who participated in it?    Mr. Lucas. So why did--and this begs the question, why did EPA wait several months to post the report marked final, then remove it from the Web site a few days later with no immediate explanation?    Mr. Lucas. Could you expand on that?    Mr. Lucas. So, Administrator----    Mr. Lucas. But, Administrator----    Mr. Lucas. --if it was not a final document, why was it marked final?    Mr. Lucas. Why was it signed out in the fashion it was?    Mr. Lucas. But you understand why those of us who follow----    Mr. Lucas. --very carefully the actions that your agency takes----    Mr. Lucas. --and all of the oversight work you have, the impact of these decisions is dramatic----    Mr. Lucas. --in certain areas.    Mr. Lucas. But you would understand why there would be----    Mr. Lucas. --some concern from those of us----    Mr. Lucas. --who watch the process----    Mr. Lucas. --that perhaps a decision made in regular order, in regular process by the people of responsibility who understand----    Mr. Lucas. --the issues had been overruled----    Mr. Lucas. --somewhere else on high and backed up----    Mr. Lucas. --and that would be a grave concern----    Mr. Lucas. --if we were putting a----    Mr. Lucas. --post-science decision that changed the outcome of the scientific work that had gone into the initial decision.    Mr. Lucas. You can see the concern.    Mr. Lucas. That----    Mr. Lucas. That said, Administrator, when will we see the final report?    Mr. Lucas. Raised concerns within the scientific community doing the review or raised concerns from those that----    Mr. Lucas. --oversee the scientific community?    Mr. Lucas. But these are the kind of things, Administrator----    Mr. Lucas. --that causes such doubt and concern----    Mr. Lucas. --in the public and in Congress and in the entities that are affected.    Mr. Lucas. This is not good for anyone----    Mr. Lucas. --to do it this way.    Mr. Lucas. And now the extra attention will be incredible when the final report----    Mr. Lucas. --does come out.    Mr. Lucas. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
