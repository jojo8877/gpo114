    Mr. Mica. Thank you. Let me kind of pick up where Mr. Gohmert, the gentleman from Texas, left off on the issue of accountability.    If a private company, corporation, or individual dumped 7,500 gallons of toxic chemical into a natural waterway, wouldn't there be a penalty? Wouldn't you hold them accountable?    Mr. Mica. You would investigate. But----    Mr. Mica . They would be--someone would be held accountable----    Mr. Mica . Responsible, you would review that.    Mr. Mica. And you do that. That is part of your responsibility.    One of the frustrations I think that Members of Congress and the American people have is holding agencies accountable. You have been there since July of 2013. You were there during this spill. Is that correct?    Mr. Mica. And you are in charge of the agency?    Mr. Mica. Is there an SES individual below you, or a deputy that also would be responsible for this, for----    Mr. Mica . Looking at this matter, and overseeing it?    Mr. Mica. OK. And who is that?    Mr. Mica. OK. Then you have a regional administrator.    Mr. Mica. Is that Shaun McGrath?    Mr. Mica. OK. And then you have an on-scene EPA----    Mr. Mica. Who is that, for the record?    Mr. Mica. OK. And you have conducted some preliminary investigation?    Mr. Mica. Everything we see, it looks like there was a mistake. You have a contractor, too, who the EPA was overseeing. Who is being held accountable, based on the information that you have so far?    Mr. Mica. And that is not complete?    Mr. Mica. That is not complete, that process?    Mr. Mica. I want you to tell the committee and report back to the committee who is held responsible. I have reviewed some of the bonuses given to different agencies in the past; and at least, historically, EPA has paid some of the biggest performance awards. In fact, some of your SES-class folks, 64 percent of them got bonuses.    I want to know if there are any recommendations pending for any bonuses for any of these individuals, and have that made part of the record. I would like that in the next 30 days.    Then also, I want, for the long-term record, for you to report back to the committee the findings and who is held accountable. I think that is the least we can do.    Mr. Mica. Then what action is taken to those individuals who have done this damage to the environment, and caused untold damage to the people sitting behind you, who we are going to hear from.    The other thing, too, is the estimate of the cost for getting this all back to regular order.    Mr. Mica. Do you have any estimate?    Mr. Mica. So $10 million. Again, all I think----    Mr. Mica. This is a reasonable request, that we hold you----    Mr. Mica . And others accountable who are responsible for this. It can be based on the independent findings, but we are looking at $10 million of cost, and a disruption to many parties. Is that correct?    Mr. Mica. Finally--I have just a second here--we have pending in some court issues dealing with the redefinition of ``navigable waters,'' and the rule.    Mr. Mica. What is the status, very briefly, of that? Is the rule going into place----    Mr. Mica. Is it on hold? And what are you doing?    Mr. Mica. Thank you.
