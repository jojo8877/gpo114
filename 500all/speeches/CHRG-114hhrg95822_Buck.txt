    Mr. Buck. And I would be glad to yield to the gentleman from North Carolina. I'm enjoying this. So I don't have any questions. So if you'd like to continue.    Mr. Buck. Thank you.    Mr. Cottingham, anything that you want to mention today that hasn't come up? Anything that you think is important to put on the record?    Mr. Buck. Thank you. Mr. Brown, same question.    Mr. Buck. Okay. Thank you.    I yield back.
