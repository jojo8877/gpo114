    Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the ranking member for calling this hearing today to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Dodd-Frank.    Let me start with Dr. Calabria about the housing crisis. You say in your testimony that you don't believe we have sufficiently addressed the distortions in the housing industry.    Let me ask you about mortgage modifications. Do you think that will help our economy--how do we help those homeowners who are underwater and give them hope--homeowners who, for the most part, were steered into high-cost predatory loans. Do you have any--    Mr. Clay. Let me share with you a situation in my district for instance, in Missouri, where we have entire communities who were steered into these high-cost loans when normally they would have qualified for conventional mortgages.    Do we write down principal--or how do we address that to help these homeowners to keep them from foreclosing, to keep them in their homes, and to keep neighborhoods together? How do we do that?    Mr. Clay. Sure.    Mr. Clay. Let me ask Mr. Silvers, can you share any solutions to the housing crisis and how we get people whole who happen to be underwater in their mortgages? Have you all addressed it?    Mr. Clay. Thank you. My time is up.
