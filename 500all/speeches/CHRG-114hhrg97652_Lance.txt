    Mr. Lance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good afternoon to the panel. New Jersey's project is notable for its use of deployable long term evolution communications technology for its first responder network, called Jersey Net. This mobile network system can be incorporated on towable trailers, SUVs, vans, and other platforms to be deployed quickly in emergency situations or natural disasters, like Hurricane Sandy, or to places where communications are limited or non-existent. It is my understanding that rural areas, which comprise about 90 percent of the country, in geography, are particularly vulnerable, since there is no built-out fixed infrastructure.    In this regard, and I go to you, Mr. Kennedy, could you provide guidance on how you plan to incorporate deployables into your buildout plans?    Mr. Lance. All Super Bowls should be in New Jersey, Mr. Kennedy.    Mr. Lance. It is on the record.    Mr. Lance. No.    Mr. Lance. Thank you. And, on another topic, FirstNet has sought comments on the definition of public safety entity on two occasions, and, as I understand it, based on press reports, there seems to be some debate among stakeholders. Mr. Kennedy, could you describe this debate, and the implications of the definition of that term for FirstNet's deployment?    Mr. Lance. In the press there has been some discussion as to the difference between six million to 13 million users, estimates. Could you give your best advice to the committee on that?    Mr. Lance. Thank you. My time is done. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
