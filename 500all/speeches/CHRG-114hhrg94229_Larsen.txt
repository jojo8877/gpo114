    Mr. Larsen. General Klotz, what are the risks of NNSA modernization plan, including executing 4-5 concurrent life-extension programs and overseeing major construction projects at Y-12 and Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 2020s?    General Klotz. NNSA has developed long term modernization efforts for the nuclear security enterprise described in the FY 2016 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan. Modernization efforts for warheads through approved Life Extension Programs face a number of risks. First, the ability to certify designs that include new or updated material combinations or surety features is a challenge for life extension programs in the absence of underground testing. To address this challenge, the national security laboratories have improved their fundamental understanding of physics package interactions through numerous enhanced physics experiments, greater computing power, and advanced simulations. Second, NNSA must mature technologies and components to transform the stockpile over the next twenty years. Technology maturation enables development and delivery of design-to-manufacturing capabilities to meeting current and future nuclear weapons needs for the Nation's stockpile. NNSA uses the Component Maturation Framework, which is a portfolio management tool used to integrate preliminary scope, proposed technology and manufacturing readiness levels, and planning estimates, to inform decisions on component development, technology maturation and timely insertion. NNSA is establishing plans to mature technologies sufficiently in advance of planned insertion points to cost-effectively minimize risk. Third, although the president's budget fully funds these activities, cuts due to sequestration can put them at risk.    For major construction projects, NNSA is committed to delivering its capital asset projects on budget and schedule. Over the past four years, NNSA has focused on putting the right policies, principles, people, processes, procedures, and partnerships in place to implement the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Circular A-11 for Capital Acquisition Projects, Department of Energy Order 413.3B on project management, and the Secretary's January 2015 enhanced project management policies. In 2013, GAO narrowed the focus of its High Risk list for NNSA to contracts and projects with a Total Project Cost greater than $750 million as a result of the improvements NNSA has been making in its contract and project management. NNSA is confident that the same policies and processes for projects less than $750 million are scalable to the major system acquisition projects at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Y-12.    Following are risks to NNSA's portfolio of construction projects:    <bullet>  Escalation on commodities and equipment procurements    <bullet>  Difficulties attracting and retaining nuclear qualified workers at assumed labor rates    <bullet>  Availability of vendors qualified to produce materials and equipment to meet current nuclear construction standards (NQA-1)    <bullet>  Changes to project requirements, codes, and standards Delays in authorizations to start construction activities    Mr. Larsen. Do you have the expertise and management in place to lower the risk of schedule slips and cost increases? Are you confident NNSA can execute this plan?    General Klotz. NNSA has the expertise and management processes in place to effectively plan and execute planned weapon system modernization activities. NNSA has established an office (NA-19) to focus on weapon system modernization. To control costs, earned value management practices are being implemented for every weapon system acquisition. The NNSA weapons workload has grown over the last several years to include 3 life extension programs and one major weapon system alteration, and each of these programs requires trained and qualified federal managers and selected subject matter experts. NNSA has developed staffing plans that will, over time and with Congressional support, align federal resources required to execute our assigned program of work.                                 ______
