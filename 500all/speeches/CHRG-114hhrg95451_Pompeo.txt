    Mr. Pompeo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Wilkins, you said in your testimony, ``You are currently examining additional workforce restructuring at all FCC facilities.'' Can you tell me if that includes studying closing field offices?    Mr. Pompeo. And are you doing that internally or do you have third parties that have assisted you in conducting that review?    Mr. Pompeo. Have they provided you with reports?    Mr. Pompeo. Drafts, memos, PowerPoint slides?    Mr. Pompeo. Do you have a draft report, do you have interim reports, do you have anything that you can share with us?    Mr. Pompeo. Is there recommendation to close field offices?    Mr. Pompeo. Right. I asked a direct question, you gave a generic response. Is there recommendation to close field offices for the FCC and relocate people to your headquarters?    Mr. Pompeo. And are these savings reflected in the budget that you have provided us?    Mr. Pompeo. You said they could show some savings. You have seen the interim report, did you assume, yes, we are going to go down that path and----    Mr. Pompeo . The budget includes it?    Mr. Pompeo. Sure, but my question is what did you do? You had interim reports, what did you assume for purposes of your budget? Did you assume there would be changes in the lease payments in the field offices, locality pay connected to that, there are lots of changes, changes in--you might have had engineers there and you would have lawyers here----    Mr. Pompeo . Tell me what you assumed when you put the----    Mr. Pompeo. Yes.    Mr. Pompeo. Right. It is just a bit disingenuous because it is not always the case that you just let folks go. Sometimes you let an engineer go and you bring a lawyer on, right? And so it is worth thinking about how you do that. It is not just a case that you used attrition, you have now made policy and programming differences that I think are important for us to understand. And I guess what I would ask you in closing is, when you get this report, it sounds like it will be in the next couple of days----    Mr. Pompeo . When you get a copy of this report, will you make sure we get a copy as well?    Mr. Pompeo. Right, but even before you decide, when you get the report, you have clearly hired a contractor to do a report, and you already have documents from this contractor, right?    Mr. Pompeo. They have provided you interim reports, that we get the interim reports.    Mr. Pompeo. Can we get the interim reports?    Mr. Pompeo. That is a yes-or-no question. Can we just get the interim reports?    Mr. Pompeo. That is----    Mr. Pompeo. Sure you would. Sure, it is OK for us to see them. There is no harm in us seeing them. You may make a different decision.    Mr. Pompeo. Taxpayers paid for these. What is the harm in sharing them with the Legislative Branch?    Mr. Pompeo. Great, thank you.    I yield back.    Mr. Pompeo. We yield.
