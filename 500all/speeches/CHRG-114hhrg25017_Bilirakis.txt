    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you so very much. I appreciate it.    Thanks to the panel as well.    Let me ask you a question on dental care. I know it is very limited as far as eligibility for veterans, but are veterans receiving dental care, let's say in the community if no one is available within the 40-mile range or the 30 days? I mean, what is going on with that?    Mr. Bilirakis. If you, in a perfect world with regard to the specialty care, if we wanted to open it up to the community for the veteran to have the ultimate choice, even if he lives within the 30-mile range, what have you, or she, what specialty would you recommend where the veteran would have direct access to community care? Can you give me a couple specialties?    Mr. Bilirakis. Well, where is it they are having the most trouble accessing care in that specialty area?    Mr. Bilirakis. Okay. So it depends on--    Mr. Bilirakis. Okay. So, in other words, we would specify based on the area, the region in the country where there is a lack of maybe care, access to care in that particular region.    All right. Let me go on to the next question. VA's consolidation plan addresses eligibility for community care, but not eligibility for enrollment in the VA health care system in the first place.    So the question is, do you think that a review of VA's overall eligibility and enrollment is needed at this time, and would you support such an effort? And that is for the panel.    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.    I am out of time, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
