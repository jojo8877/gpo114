    Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I know that Ranking Member Richmond is on his way, and on his behalf I will just welcome our witnesses.    In particular, I want to acknowledge Greg Garcia, whom I worked with when I chaired this subcommittee many years ago and when you had the Department of Homeland Security.    I thank all of you for your work. I know in one way or another I have had the opportunity to interact with all of our witnesses. Thank you for the work you are doing to better protect our country. I look forward to hearing your perspective here today.    Mr. Chairman, I especially want to commend you for holding this hearing today. Thank you for giving the information-sharing and data breach issues the attention that it needs and deserves. Hearing from expert witnesses I know will move this issue ahead further.    Obviously, there is no one answer to solving our cybersecurity challenges. It is never a problem to be solved, as I have said many times, but it is a problem to be managed, and we have to do a much better job of getting to a place where we are much better protected in cyber space than where we are. We can close that air of vulnerability down to something much more manageable.    It won't be just a Government answer, of course, and it is not going to be just private sector. It is going to take that collaboration of us working together to solve this and deal with this incredible challenge.    So, with that, I will yield back.    I thank our witnesses in advance for being here and what they are about to say.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
