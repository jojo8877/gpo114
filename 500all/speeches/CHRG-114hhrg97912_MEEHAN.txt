    Mr. MEEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank all of the panelists for your presence here.    Mr. Randolph, I thank you for your testimony and your submitted testimony as well. I know one of the things that you introduced was a chart that described activity in my own home State of Pennsylvania, in which you had done some work. And curiously, you were able to identify a circumstance in which a single mother who was making--was better off earning an income of--gross income of $29,000 with $57,000 net income and benefits than to be earning $69,000 with a net income and benefits of $57,000.    Could you elaborate what you meant by that in the chart?    Mr. MEEHAN. Well, I thank you for describing, you know, the cliff issue, which is one of the things we are looking at about. How those affected by changing circumstances, and particularly a lot of times, I think some of the times you were looking, the issue of a recession. You know, we have economies that aren't flat; they are cyclical. And during the period of time when I was in Pennsylvania looking at this particular issue, we actually saw an expansion of the activities supporting, in my own Montgomery County, 118 percent increase in the total number of persons receiving SNAP, 173 percent increase in children receiving SNAP.    But these were children, and this was during a period of time in which, notwithstanding the fact that some of them may have been put back into jobs, the nature of the--you know, the nature of the job was that the wages were such that they weren't sufficiently escaping poverty to the point that they were able to also escape the need for the assistance for the food.    Can you give me some insights about how a recession affects things?    Mr. MEEHAN. Thank you. My time has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
