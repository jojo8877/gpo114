    Ms. Tsongas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate very much the thoughtful testimony you are both giving today. And to think over and over again you reinforce the complexity of the challenge that we face. But we all know that, bottom line, we do have a fundamental obligation in this very complex environment to best protect our country and be sure that we keep this country and our people safe. And given the dynamics of the Middle East, it does raise a lot of questions. I appreciate, Ambassador Crocker, that you have a lot of confidence in our Secretary Kerry, that in your testimony, you have suggested that he should become more engaged in Baghdad, that we as a country, through him, have an important role to play in bridging some of the divides between the different elements of the fight. But much of his attention is now turned to Russia. And I am curious as to your thoughts, both of your thoughts, really, as to whether or not Russia is changing its calculations at all given the downing of their jet and their seeming openness, at least through Mr. Lavrov, to engage in some way with Secretary Kerry, what you see as the possibilities there.    You suggested, I think, Ambassador Crocker, we have to be very wary that what they seek is something quite different. But I would be curious as to your thoughts. Is there a diplomatic option here, at least in the context of Syria, that at least might slow the outflow and the humanitarian crisis that we are witnessing?    Ms. Tsongas. I want to give Ambassador Crocker just a moment. I am about out of time, but I appreciate your comments thus far.    Ms. Tsongas. I am sorry, Ambassador Crocker, we won't be able to hear you.    The Chairman. I bet we will come back around to that question because it is a very important issue in solving all this.    Mr. Turner.
