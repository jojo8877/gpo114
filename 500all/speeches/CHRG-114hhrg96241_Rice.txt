    Mr. Rice. Thank you so much. It is my great honor to be here, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for having me.    Mr. Graves, thank you for having me.    I am not on this committee. I am from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which is a big tourism area, and we are considering opening the Atlantic offshore for drilling. My community is very concerned about it, which is why I am here, to learn a lot more.    Mr. Henderson, I want to start with you. Is it your position that no offshore drilling is safe? A really quick answer.    Mr. Rice. OK.    Mr. Rice. Is there anybody who----    Mr. Rice. All right. Is it your position that there is no deepwater--that we should shut off deepwater drilling?    Mr. Rice. OK, good.    Mr. Herbst, I want to talk to you for just a few minutes. You say that increased production and increased safety are not mutually exclusive. I think I heard you say that, right?    Mr. Rice. So, you think we can do this, and we can do this in a safe manner.    Mr. Rice. Ms. Davis, certainly you believe that there needs to be a little more control to prevent, I would think, the Macondo-type incidents from occurring. Would you not agree with that?    Mr. Rice. Are you saying that we should just leave it to industry to self-impose additional safety measures, that the government should have no role in that? Is that what you are saying?    Mr. Rice. So, you agree that there should be some additional level of oversight, but the proposed rule is far beyond what you agree with?    Mr. Rice. OK.    Mr.--I can't say your name--Leimkuhler?    Mr. Rice. Would you agree with that, that there should be some additional oversight after Macondo?    Mr. Rice. OK.    Mr. Rice. Do you think that we can do this drilling, and do it in a safe manner, protect the environment with reasonable protections for people, and still continue to increase production?    Mr. Rice. Mr. Herbst, this Well Control Rule, is this your graph here--the losses of well control incidents in the Gulf of Mexico 2008? Is this your graph?    Mr. Rice. That is a little scary to me. From 2008, we have eight loss of well control incidents. In 2013, we had eight; and in 2014, we have seven. Are you saying that even with these additional measures that have been imposed, that we are continuing to have loss of control of wells at the same rate as before?    Mr. Rice. So, when you are speaking of losses of well control, in orders of magnitude, there has been nothing that approaches Macondo; correct?    Mr. Rice. OK. All right.    Mr. Rice. A very short time.    Mr. Rice. OK. Thank you, sir.    Mr. Leimkuhler, do you agree with that? Do you think the Atlantic should be opened to offshore drilling?    Mr. Rice. Ms. Davis, do you agree with that? Do you think the Atlantic should be opened to offshore drilling? Yes or no?    Mr. Rice. Dr. Mason, I have 13 seconds left.    Mr. Rice. Mr. Herbst, do you think the Atlantic should be opened to offshore drilling?    Mr. Rice. Thank you.    Mr. Rice. I yield my time. My time has expired. Thank you.    Mr. Rice. Just a couple more questions.    I am looking at the map here put out by LLOG of the Gulf, the coast of the Gulf, and this issue about Mexico piques my interest. How far offshore does our U.S. Government jurisdiction go in regulating this offshore oil, Mr. Herbst?    Mr. Rice. All right. And that 200 miles would apply in the Atlantic as well?    Mr. Rice. OK. So, a foreign country could come and drill 201 miles off our shore?    Mr. Rice. OK. Mr. Herbst, I am going to pick on you for a little while. Is there more risk in deepwater drilling than there is in shallow water drilling?    Mr. Rice. Mr. Leimkuhler, would you say there was more or less risk in deepwater or the same?    Mr. Rice. These pressures that oil comes out, the pressure the oil is under, is that necessarily related to the depth of the water, or is it somewhat related to the depth of the water?    Mr. Rice. OK.    Ms. Davis, do you think deepwater drilling is less or more risky than shallow water drilling, or the same?    Mr. Rice. All right.    What is deep, Mr. Herbst? How do you define what deepwater is?    Mr. Rice. OK.    I yield back my time.    The Chairman. Thank you.    I have a couple of quick questions for a few people.    Mr. Herbst, let me start with you. You said to one of the questions that if companies commented on the rule, they were invited back. So, all companies who made comments would be ensured of meeting with BSEE?
