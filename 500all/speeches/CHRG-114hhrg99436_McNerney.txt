    Mr. McNerney. I thank the ranking member, and I thank the chairman for holding this important hearing.    Low-level nuclear waste may not be as dangerous as high-level nuclear waste but it is still a risk and people are justifiably concerned about that risk.    There are engineering solutions that would allow us to find disposal sites, to transport nuclear materials for those disposal sites and there is an urgency to this problem.    But the real challenge is the politics. In order to get this accepted we have to be transparent. We have to let the public know what the risks are and what benefits there might be to local communities.    We need to let them buy into it because if we try to enforce nuclear waste on any communities it is not going to work. So I urge that we develop a system that is very transparent, that is very public friendly and I think if we do that we will be able to find a solution.    So with that, I will yield back.
