    Mr. Hardy. Thank you. Mr. Weiss, thank you for being here. You mentioned that the Puerto Rican debt payments of nearly $800 million in constitutionally prioritized debt are unlikely to be made. What impact--and I apologize if any of these questions have been asked since I was late--but what impact will that have, not only on if they fail and are prioritized over the credit markets, what will that do to not only the structure and future bonding of government GO bonds in the future to Puerto Rico, but what will it do outside of the market, over the country?    Mr. Hardy. But to add to that question, what I was trying to ask is--default happens--if it happens, does that cause concerns outside of Puerto Rico to bond shareholders for future GO bonds?    Mr. Hardy. You talked earlier about how this independent board has worked in other avenues for restructuring debt. Would you mind telling me what the make up of this board would be, overall? What individuals would be on this board?    Mr. Hardy. If individuals from Puerto Rico are added to this board, does that possibly create a political challenge there? Or does this independence--will it look at it in an objective way to make sure that we always are moving forward in the right direction to solve this problem versus maybe some combative areas of it, or how does that----    Mr. Hardy. Any concern at all?    Mr. Hardy. Thank you, and I yield back.    The Chairman . Mr. Polis.
