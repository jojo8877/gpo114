    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, gentlemen for being here and thank you for what you do to protect our homeland. We appreciate it very much.    Let me ask you--you know, this is the kind of report that you read through and you are concerned about everything, and not one thing more so than the other. But one of the things that struck me was about the foreign fighter travel. I just want to know what we can do to better control that. From what I understand, we are not using all of our resources. I don't know that the administration has even identified a lead agency to combat this. Is that true?    Mr. Carter. So the message I am getting from you here today is that you feel like we have got that under control, or doing the best we can?    Mr. Carter. Okay. Let me switch here to a quick--and let's talk about the Visa Waiver program. As I understand it, there are certain people who are eligible for this and it is good for 90 days and it expires in 90 days?    Mr. Carter. But those countries that we are most concerned with, it is up to 90 days, generally?    Mr. Carter. In terms of the waiver.    Mr. Carter. Okay, well, let me ask you this: What happens when it expires? Do we have someone who checks up on these people to make sure that they are not still here?    Mr. Carter. Okay. Well, as I can imagine it, you have got a tickler file set up, and if somebody exceeds that 90 days and they haven't left----    Mr. Carter . Then you go looking for them?    Mr. Carter. Okay. Mr. Chairman, I yield the remaining time.
