    Mr. Grothman. OK. A followup question for you.    Mr. Grothman. Followup question for you. There was a meeting on January 28. Did you provide a 1-week notice of the Board vote on that meeting?    Mr. Grothman. OK.    Mr. Grothman. Did you provide Board Member Griffon a copy of the motion prior to the hearing?    Mr. Grothman. OK. So he didn't have an opportunity to review the motion prior to the vote?    Mr. Grothman. I would like to ask Mr. Griffon to comment on that, how much advance notice you were given.    Mr. Grothman. OK. So you feel it was by design that you weren't given a copy of the motion? Would that be an accurate statement?    Mr. Grothman. OK.    Mr. Moure-Eraso, just one more question. Under the Sunshine Act, it requires agencies to make public announcements at least 1 week in advance of--you should be noticing location, the time, and the subject matter of the Board meeting. Do you feel that you complied with that statute?    Mr. Grothman. OK. I'll yield the rest of my time.
