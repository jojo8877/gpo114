    Mr. Zinke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding what appears to be a bipartisan effort to fix the problem.    It is interesting that Montana is about a million people, Puerto Rico is about three times the size. And we are not a territory, we are a state. But clearly I looked at the Constitution--and I will quote--``The Congress shall have the power to dispose and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or the property belonging to the United States.'' Clearly, Congress has the power.    And to your point, in the 1990s, Congress did look at Washington, DC, and the District, and there seems to be a great bit of difference between the two, particularly in the debt.    And as I look at it, the discussion is on the control board, what power? On one side you have an advisory board. On the other side controlling every aspect of the Puerto Rican Commonwealth.    I guess my question to you is what do you believe are the core explicit powers that the Federal oversight should have?    Mr. Zinke. Where would you place a priority of an independent audit?    Mr. Zinke. I look to my colleague's point about the economy. I don't know a lot about Puerto Rico, but I have looked into--a lot of the baseline economy is the ability to produce power at a rate that is reliable and affordable. If we are going to look at manufacturing, certainly that has to be a part of it.    And my understanding is the power plant, the structure of it gets their fuel load at an excessive price, and there has not been a lot of investment into that power plant. If we are going to look at driving the economy as far as jobs, that power plant has to be part of it. Is there any idea how to address that portion of it?    Mr. Zinke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
