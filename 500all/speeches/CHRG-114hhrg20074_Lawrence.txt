    Ms. LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    I would like to ask this question of Ms. Emerson. Hearing the discussion on the challenges, there has been a shift in the development of small businesses to the use of incubators. What does it mean to startups to have that kind of business when you are saying you need support? What is the role, and how can we support the incubators if that is the way to provide you with the support that you need?    Ms. LAWRENCE. I appreciate that. I think we, as the Small Business Committee, should really spend some time supporting that.    I want to ask Ms. Ramberg, one of the greatest areas of success in my home state in Metro Detroit has been the rise of women-owned small businesses. According to the U.S. Census and the Small Business Administration, Michigan ranks among the top 10 states in the number of new small businesses operated or open by men and women who are self-employed. How can we sustain the growth rates among women in small business? As a small business owner yourself, you already outlined some of those, but what would you advise us on this Committee on how we can do a better job with women?    Ms. LAWRENCE. Mr. Ray, and this is the last question, what are some of the challenges that you face in the competition with the corporates? I hear that often. I am a small business and I keep jumping up raising my hand. Look at me. Look at me. I can do it. What are some of the challenges there?    Ms. LAWRENCE. I hear clearly the need for information and training, and I love the analysis of not being alone and having access to those. So thank you, I yield back.
