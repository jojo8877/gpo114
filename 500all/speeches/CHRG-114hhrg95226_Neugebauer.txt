    Mr. Neugebauer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Kerr, you know, since 1986, EPA and the Corps has only had jurisdiction over the wetlands adjacent to other jurisdictional waters. Can you explain in detail the rule's new concept of adjacent waters?    Mr. Neugebauer. I'm over here in the cheap seats.    Mr. Neugebauer. So to your knowledge, is there legal precedent for the agencies to establish jurisdiction over these waters?    Mr. Neugebauer. So as a wetlands delineator, or can you describe how the new adjacent-waters definitions including the neighboring definition will change the way you make your jurisdictional determinations?    Mr. Neugebauer. I want to get to talking about ditches, and I think one of the things that my agriculture community thinks, has concerns that by--those people that believe that EPA has exempted some of the ditches from their jurisdiction, or EPA is telling, I guess, the agriculture community that. Do you believe that's in fact true?    Mr. Neugebauer. So there is still confusion out there and uncertainty when it comes to the ditches issue?
