    Mr. Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Well, whoever would like to answer this. I have heard time and time again from ambulance companies that VA misapplies a prudent layperson standard for emergency transportation.    For example, VA has been requiring ambulance providers to wait for underlying emergency care claims to be processed, and to provide medical documentation from the veterans' emergency room visit prior to processing the transportation claims. Although VA insists this isn't required, clearly the practice continues throughout the country, and veterans are often left with the bill.    What is needed to correct the prudent layperson standard in the case of emergency ambulatory care? Who can answer that question? Yes.    Mr. Coffman. Okay. Last Saturday, I spoke at a convention for ophthalmologists. There were about 400 in Colorado. Well, last Sunday. And there were some VA personnel in there as well, docs as well. And everybody seemed to uniformly complain about Health Net--    Mr. Coffman. Who devised this contract? Who is responsible?    Mr. Coffman. But it was designed for the PC3 Program?    Mr. Coffman. And now it is being used on the Choice Program?    Mr. Coffman. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
