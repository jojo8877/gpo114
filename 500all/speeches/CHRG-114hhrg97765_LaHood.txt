    Mr. LaHood. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I want to thank the witnesses for your testimony today and for your commitment and dedication to what you do.    Dr. Seidel, we appreciate you being here, and thank you for the work you do at University of Illinois with our program there. And I wanted to just follow up a little bit on your reference to the private sector partner program. You referenced Caterpillar and some of the other companies that you work with.    In terms of kind of the real-world effects of that in terms of product design, competitiveness, and the iForge project, can you talk a little bit more about that? And I guess as a follow-up, do you think we're doing enough to highlight what we do in the private sector in making people aware of that, and is there room to grow there?    Mr. LaHood. Thank you.    Dr. Hager, I wanted to--you referenced earlier, I guess, in the last set of questions about Japan. In terms of U.S. leadership and where we are with competitiveness in the world when it comes to supercomputing, can you talk a little bit about how we rank worldwide and where we're at in terms of our competitiveness and looking to the future a little bit and what we need to do to stay where we're at or to improve?    Mr. LaHood. And I guess is there--in terms of being--you know, continuing on the path we're on or moving up to compete with China, I mean is that strictly a resource issue or is that--are there other factors that relate to that?    Mr. LaHood. And, last question, do you think we're prepared to go to that next level currently?    Mr. LaHood. Thank you.    Chairwoman Comstock. Thank you. And I now recognize Mr. Hultgren for five minutes.
