    Mr. Cramer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the witnesses.    I just have one question for Ms. Hyde I was reading the HHS budget justification, and in your opening, I think you said something to the effect that--and maybe you could tell me what you said, what percentage of the SAMHSA budget was dedicated last year to SMI?    Mr. Cramer. Right.    Mr. Cramer. That is what I thought--OK, thank you for that clarification. Because in the budget justification put out by HHS where it talks about SAMHSA, it never mentions serious mental illness. Can you reconcile that omission with the commitment that you are talking about today? That just seems like somebody is not as committed to it perhaps as you are. Or am I mistaken? Because I couldn't find it. I couldn't find any mention of SMI in the budget justification from HHS.    Mr. Cramer. I guess it is the lack of reference or mentioning even raises for me the question of the seriousness of the commitment to this particular issue, which is not a small issue, this is a very big issue, a very big concern for me. If you want to elaborate, I am willing, otherwise I yield back.    Mr. Cramer. Sure.    Mr. Cramer. Yes.    Mr. Cramer. OK, very well. Yes, what I am talking about is, the SAMHSA in brief never mentions serious mental illness. And I just--again, what it raises for me, and I think a lot of us are struggling with this, is the serious level of commitment to SMI, and we hope going forward that there is a greater acknowledgement and greater evidence that this commitment is real and it is going to be dealt with in substantive ways, as opposed to what we did last year.    I yield back.
