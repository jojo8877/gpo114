    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Keller and, both, Mr. Glaser, you have talked about how Turkey has stepped up and that they are doing more. Can you give us more specifics on what that is?    Because, like many of my colleagues, we have concerns about the leadership in Turkey, what they have done directly and indirectly, what they have not done, more importantly, as well as the informal economy that we know ISIS is using to both smuggle cash and other things to boost their revenue.    Ms. Gabbard. Can you give some specifics about stepping up from nothing to what, or from here to there, and some specifics on the border, as well, especially the area of the border that remains open?    Ms. Gabbard. Because it is just, I am trying to get some context here, because Mr. Keller said Turkey is not perfect, but perfect is a pretty high bar. So I am trying to figure out----    Ms. Gabbard. And is that something that has changed as of late, or were the reports that that was occurring completely false?    Ms. Gabbard. Are there other operations or things happening in this informal market or smuggling other than oil that you are aware of?    Ms. Gabbard. Okay.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you.
