    Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank you and the ranking member for adding H. Res. 348 to this markup. And I want to thank the authors of the resolution. This committee has spoken loudly about not only Ukraine, but about Crimea as an integral part of the Ukraine, and that we are not conceding. And I am glad to say that the nonrecognition act on the Ukraine has in fact been incorporated into the defense authorization bill.    It is vital that we speak firmly and we back it up with sanctions and other measures so that Vladimir Putin never gets the wrong impression about our acquiescence in a violent military action that subverted the sovereignty of another country. We will not accept that. Ever. And I think it is really important this committee continues to speak with one voice and as firmly as possible on a bipartisan basis. And indeed we have.    So I thank Mr. Cicilline in particular for his leadership on this resolution, and look forward to voting for it. And thank you, Mr. Chairman, and you, Mr. Engel, the ranking member, for your leadership as well.
