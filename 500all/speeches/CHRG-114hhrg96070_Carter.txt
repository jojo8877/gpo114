    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for being late. I have got a bill on the floor. Thank you very much for being here. I am from Texas, as my colleague from Texas pointed out, and energy export remains a major driver of the Texas economy. The Obama administration's regulatory policies threaten to impair this vital part of our trade economy. How does your agency expect our nation to be able to expand trade to reach foreign markets if the regulatory burden here at home cripples those industries? And with these concerns in mind what are the challenges to encouraging direct foreign investment in domestic industries?    Mr. Carter. Oh, you did not answer my question about the, the United States regulatory burden and how it affects trade and commerce.    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
