    Mr. Veasey. I did have one question that I wanted to ask the panel. As far as acquisition reform is concerned, and someone may have already asked this, so if they have, please forgive that. But if there was one area of reform that you could pick and you can only pick one, like where would it be? And it could be a policy or a technique or anything that would just maybe be the beginning of something really good as far as acquisition reform is concerned.    Mr. Veasey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I yield back my time.    The Chairman. Thank you.    Mr. Brooks, do you have questions?
