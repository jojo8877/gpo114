    Mr. LaHood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the witnesses for being here today.    In my State of Illinois we've had a lot of changes in the last several years. We now have same-day voting registration, 40 days of early voting, extended grace periods, absentee voting has a lengthy period of time. And couple that with some of the issues we've had particularly in Chicago over the years with issues related to voting there, I guess in terms of educating poll workers or training poll workers or election judges and looking at methods, particularly as it relates to the integrity of voting on Election Day and as we look at potential hacking of machines, I mean, is there a good model out there that has worked in terms of how we educate folks that are there at the polls?    I'll also mention in a prior life I was Assistant State's Attorney in Cook County in Chicago. On Election Day, we would go out as prosecutors and be there at the voting booth. And a lot of times we didn't know what we're looking for or what we were supposed to be doing.    And I guess, Secretary Schedler, can you maybe shed a little light on examples of what we need to be doing in terms of educating and working with our folks that are at the polls on Election Day?    Mr. LaHood. And just as a follow up on that, the level of what you go through in Louisiana, are you confident that that type of education and training is consistent across the country?    Mr. LaHood. And, Dr. Wallach, with all these changes we've seen recently with voting and how we vote--and I went to the litany there--what is the future of voting look like?    Mr. LaHood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
