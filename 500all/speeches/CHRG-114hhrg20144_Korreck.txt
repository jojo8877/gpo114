    Ms. Korreck. Hi. I am Dr. Kelly Korreck, and I brought with me today a prototype of the Solar Probe Cup. This cup is going to fly in 2018 on NASA's Solar Probe mission. This is a mission to actually touch the sun. And here in the picture, you will see that the cup is actually sticking out there and is going to collect parts of the sun.    And it is not just a scientific enterprise, but it is also somewhat practical. Understanding the sun and what it throws at us actually will help us understand space weather, which can help us save our national power grid, as well as communication satellites. And so this is a part of one of the four instrument suites; there are other instrument suites aboard here, and they are all going to fly in 2018.
