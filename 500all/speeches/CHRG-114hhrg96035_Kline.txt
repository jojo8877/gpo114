    Mr. Kline. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks for holding the hearing.    Thanks to all the witnesses for being here. Real experts and excellent testimony.    I picked up a theme, if I can use that term, when I was listening to both Ms. Scaduto and Dr. Rue, about complexity. Somebody, I think it was Dr. Rue, used the words ``swirl of regulations'' and a ``patchwork of regulations.'' And Ms. Scaduto, in her four recommendations, the one that is written and not--wasn't oral has--says ``harmonize standards, obligations, expectations under Title IX, VAWA, and Clery.''    It does seem to me that it is confusing because you have different statutes with different requirements, and I have great confidence that everybody in this room--sitting up here, sitting there, or sitting in the gallery, so to speak--wants to find a way to eliminate sexual assaults on campus, and should it occur, to make sure that we are holding perpetrators accountable and that we are providing support and protection for victims. But it does seem to be complex.    So I will just go to you, Ms. Scaduto, in part because I lived in the beautiful town of Carlisle for a while. It is a beautiful part of the country and of the state, and my son graduated from Carlisle High School. And so I have got this tie. I have just got to go to Carlisle. And it is Carlisle, not--anyway, it is a long story.    Are you concerned that the emphasis that is being placed, the focus that is being placed on complying with these different federal laws, regulations, and guidance is detracting from your ability to do what is in the best interest of your students?    Mr. Kline. Thank you very much.    I yield back.    Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I now recognize the ranking member, Mr. Scott.
