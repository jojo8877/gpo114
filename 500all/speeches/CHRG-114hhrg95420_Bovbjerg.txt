    Ms. Bovbjerg. Yeah. Continuing disability reviews are medical reviews to see if they're still qualified for disability benefits. And the Social Security Administration has really not been doing many for children. And they have told us that the reason for this is that they--they're husbanding their resources and they've chosen to focus on the adults. But the fact of the matter is they really have not done the level of continuing disability review for any age that they should be doing. This is something that every dollar spent saves $9 in Federal funds. And in this case we were talking about children in Supplemental Security Income, which is a general fund program. But if you think about it also for disability insurance, which is a trust fund funded program, this is a program integrity issue in programs that are going to run out of money. So it's really important that they take this very seriously because otherwise they will be paying disability benefits for years to people who have medically improved to the extent that they don't--they don't any longer meet the eligibility requirements.    Ms. Bovbjerg. It's always possible, but I like to think that that doesn't happen a lot.    Ms. Bovbjerg. I don't, but it has gone up. Disability in all categories has gone up.    Ms. Bovbjerg. Well, the one in this year's report is really about how they--how States who are responsible for managing waste, fraud, and abuse in the food stamp program, are trying to discern who is essentially selling their cards. And the guidance given by the Food and Nutrition Service suggests that whenever somebody has gotten four replacement cards you better look at that individual. And in our work, we took to heart that the State said can't look at all those people and it's not--it's not--we're not getting anything from this. We're essentially getting people who have an unstable living environment. You know, they might be homeless and they're losing their cards. They weren't finding people selling their cards. And we found a way that they could use the same data and they could just better target their approach, that we felt that if they looked for someone who asked for four replacement cards in four different benefit periods, that reduced the number of people they were looking at, at least in the three States that we examined, by almost half, and then they could focus much more greatly on these people who are much more likely to have been selling their cards.    Ms. Bovbjerg. The ones that they looked at--the ones that they looked at just on the basis of the four card rule, it wasn't panning out for them at the level that you would expect and you would want. And, we felt that the States should spend their resources--their limited resources on the people who are more likely selling the cards. Certainly you want to look at everybody, but if you don't have the resources you definitely want to target.    Ms. Bovbjerg. We have done work on the Social Security records. We've been very interested in their death records. And why you would have people who were 112 and older who were not in the death records is troubling. And I think the Social Security's response to this has been the people that were identified, in particular by their inspector general most recently, are not active beneficiaries. So, we don't really need to verify that because it's not part of our program.    But the death records are a very important aspect of program integrity across the Federal Government. They're shared with other agencies to make sure that we're not sending checks to dead people, and it would be very important to keep that information up-to-date. So, yeah, we're very concerned about that.    Ms. Bovbjerg. Absolutely. And some of them are.
