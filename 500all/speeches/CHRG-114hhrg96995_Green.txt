    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the ranking member. Of course, I also thank the witness for appearing today.    Mr. Secretary, in your annual report you cite some concerns about cybersecurity. Ironically, yesterday the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing on cybersecurity styled, ``A Global Perspective on Cyber Threats.'' One of the things that I took away from this hearing is that there appears to be clear and convincing evidence that cyber threats and attacks pose a clear and present danger to our financial system.    And I am pleased to see that you have addressed this, and you need additional assistance pursuant to what I am reading. You indicate that you would like for Congress to provide the financial regulators with the authority to oversee third-party vendors. And I believe I have some sense of why, but I think that the record should reflect your thoughts on why this is so important.    Mr. Green. I want to concur with you. The witnesses who appeared yesterday all indicated, I believe, that you are at the top of the game as it were, that you are doing better than most.    Mr. Green. They didn't say that we have absolute security and I understand this. My concerns have to do with the need for authority. What would you have us do immediately to give you this authority? I know that it is in broad terms here. Are there some specifics that you can call to our attention?    Mr. Green. Thank you.    And finally this: You have indicated that you believe that you should be allowed to coordinate a national plan, as it were, to deal with these responses to cyber threats, and you would like to coordinate this with law enforcement, Homeland Security, as well as regulators. How far along are we with this concept of your having this opportunity to coordinate a national plan?    Mr. Green. Thank you for your service.    And I yield back.
