    Mr. Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Just a question about ISIS. I served in Iraq with the Marine Corps, in 2005, in Ramadi and Fallujah; in 2006, in Haditha, Barwana, Haqlaniyah in the Western Euphrates River Valley. And what I found in the Sunni Arab population is they clearly didn't like us. We have upset the apple cart. They saw the government in Baghdad as a Shia-dominated government, sectarian government that was against them. And they were against the government. But when they saw later on a path, the fissures between the Al Qaeda element and the local insurgents became more significant over time. And I think when they saw a path where they could be a part of the government, then those fissures, you know, exploded between the two. And I found them to be a very moderate people. Boys and girls went to school together in these towns; secular curriculum, annual exams, and very dependent upon a lot of government services. And so it is hard for me to envision them subjugated to this radical Islamic group, ISIS. Just, they were temporarily in line with Al Qaeda, and then they broke up. And so what is the prognosis here? And I will refer to each one of you.    Mr. Coffman. I am out of time. I yield back.    The Chairman. Ms. Gabbard.
