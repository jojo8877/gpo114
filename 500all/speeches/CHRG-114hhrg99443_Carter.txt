    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Madam Secretary, for being here. Madam Secretary, as you know, I am a pharmacist, so I am very concerned about issues, obviously, dealing with patients and dealing with them getting their medications.    Specifically, I wanted to ask you about compounding, compounding for office use only. I am very concerned about the FDA interpreting legislative intent, and certainly this is something that comes into play when we are talking about for office use only.    I know the FDA continues to prevent medications to be compounded for office use only, and what this causes is for the patients to have to go back to the pharmacy, get a specific prescription, compound it for them, then go back to the doctor to have it applied.    I am wondering where you are at in that process? Many States have already allowed for this to take place. Many States have already had regulations and laws in place that allow for office use only, for compounds to be made, and for the physician to have them there in the office where the physician has the ability to apply and use that medication instead of the patient having to go get a specific prescription filled for them as opposed to having it for office use only.    I just want to know where we are at in that process.    Mr. Carter. Compounding is occurring--    Mr. Carter. I beg to differ. The problem is you are requiring each specific patient to have a specific prescription for medication, for a compounded medication. What in the past we have been able to do is just to supply--    Mr. Carter. Exactly, with a compound that is for office use only, in which they can apply that medication.    Mr. Carter. Absolutely.    Mr. Carter. We are looking for guidance from the FDA on this, and this is an issue that we are very concerned with because again it has to do with patient care. We want to make sure that patients are getting the care they need.    Mr. Carter. Okay, thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
