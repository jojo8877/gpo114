    Mrs. Love. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I understand that the MDBs may be feeling some competition from the Chinese development banks, and the BRIC bank--the BRIC's banks. And that perhaps they may be lowering their standards in order to meet the competition.    What do you think we need to do in terms of the standards and the safeguards in this new landscape? And I ask each one of you, do you think that we need to adjust traditional methods? Do you think that we need to adjust a little bit to accommodate for what is happening in this type of landscape?    Mrs. Love. Okay.    Mrs. Love. Okay.    Mrs. Love. Okay. Thank you.    Mrs. Love. So you think you will see them raising them their standards?    Mrs. Love. Okay. I will just move on. Professor Karlan, in reading your testimony, you highlight the value of translating knowledge and you have mentioned that several times today, into policy and practice. In other words that the MDBs can provide great value through the research they conduct, and determine which programs have the great--have the greatest positive effect on development, and therefore give us the best return on investment.    So, the MDBs collectively have many decades of experience, and you give some examples of specific programs, such as Kenya, and the public transportation there. In my view, they are very micro level programs, so my question is: what are the broader conclusions, do you think we can draw about the types of reforms that would be most effective in spurring development? For example, the policies that encourage the private sector to grow as a key to sustainable growth.    Mrs. Love. I have one more question I need to get in, because this is an important question for me. How do you think the MDBs can better support entrepreneurship in business-led growth, as a foundation for stronger economic growth and higher living standards? I can ask you, Mr. Morris, do you think that we can?    Mrs. Love. Yes.    Mrs. Love. Yes. Thank you.
