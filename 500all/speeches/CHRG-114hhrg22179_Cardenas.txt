    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you very much for imparting your knowledge with us on what is going on in this dynamic, fast-changing industry.    The first question is from my wife. When do you think that they will be able to make a husband's brain? I didn't say a human brain, I said a husband's brain to help someone pick up after oneself, remember anniversaries, et cetera. Just kidding, just kidding. That is the impossible, I know.    Now, on a more serious note, we have noticed that in America's libraries we have had an increase of donations and opportunities where libraries are investing in 3D printers now to the tune of over 400 libraries have access to little or no cost to individuals going to the library.    To me, this is a very important issue for making sure that we have access to as many minds and as many inquisitive folks so that they can get turned on to how wonderful it is and the potential of getting a job in the industry.    How committed is the industry to advancing that kind of effort?    Mr. Cardenas. Yes. That is an investment in human capital and connecting your industry to the minds of the workers of the future.    Yes, Mr. Morris?    Mr. Cardenas. Yes. Thank you for pointing that out.    One of the things that I am so proud to be an American is the fact that we have this reputation that when we embark on something and we dedicate ourselves to doing it well, it takes a long-term vision and a long-term commitment. And there are infrastructure costs, there are ongoing costs, et cetera, instead of just the flash of, for example, the ribbon cutting, giving away printers, and then coming back a year later and embarrassingly realize that none of them are in use because, you just explained, that without the follow-through, they are not doing anybody any good.    Mr. Cardenas. And it is a falsehood whenever any of us, whether it is Government or private industry or philanthropically, we do something without looking at the long sight of the issue. So thank you for pointing that out.    But the follow-up on that is I hope that you read into my question, and not just libraries, public schools, et cetera, that the industry actually maps out and shows us how we can either partner or they can take the lead, et cetera, and how we can make sure that we have that available as much as possible to every community in America. Again, it is an investment in human capital, I think.    I want to point out with my limited time here that when it comes to bioprinting, apparently when you look at the 3D printer is used to place bio ink in precise locations, allowing cell types to align themselves in a manner that resembles the origination of native human tissues. These 3D human tissues can then be employed in drug discovery and development, biological research, and therapeutic implants for the treatment of damaged and degenerating tissues and organs, et cetera. You get the picture. This is amazing.    What do you see the top-line issues facing those efforts when it comes to regulatory and technology and world competition?    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
