    Mrs. Lummis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to waive my opening statement so we can listen to our witnesses, and I want to especially thank you all for being here today. The representatives and witnesses from Maine and Florida, I believe, are particularly to be recognized for traveling all this way to provide their guidance and expertise on this subject. Having come from the executive branch of State government, I know how hard you work, and you are on the frontlines. We really appreciate what you do, so thank you for being here today to share your expertise, one and all.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.    Mrs. Lummis. Go ahead, sis. Give them a good one.
