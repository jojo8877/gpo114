    Mr. Duncan. Also in the South.    Mr. Duncan. Southern California.    I just want to piggyback on Ms. Stefanik's question. You didn't really answer. What are the actual incentives? Besides saying transparency and let's get together and sing Kumbaya, what are the actual incentives to keep private companies with stockpiles or to keep them ahead of the whole curve in the first place? What is DOD doing, with the FDA, for instance, to say, hey, we are going to add you to the, what is it, the priority voucher program, like we added Ebola to last year, what are we going to do to add anything else that our service members face overseas with the FDA and DOD so that industry is ahead of it and not playing catch-up when bad things happen?    Mr. Duncan. How do you know what to stockpile or what you need private industry to do when you don't know what the bad guys may have or what they may use?    Mr. Duncan. I want to ask you this. So you know where we have people at throughout the world. So I would just ask, is there one, is there anything just screaming at you in the face where you are like, we have people here and we are not prepared for this?    Mr. Duncan. Let me ask this, you made me think of another question, then. You talk about Korea, so I am guessing China and Russia have the technological capability to be able to develop different bad things to affect people. Do you have to worry about that in places like Syria, where the lab might be in someone's kitchen? I mean, it is not like they are high tech compared to the North Koreans or the Russians or Chinese or even the Pakistanis.    Mr. Duncan. But they don't have the technology to be able to make more sophisticated bad things either, do they? You can't make that in a kitchen in Syria. It takes a lab.    Mr. Duncan. Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
