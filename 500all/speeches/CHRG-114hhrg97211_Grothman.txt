    Mr. Grothman. Okay. First of all, I'd like to make a comment. I can tell you, I'm 60 years old, I think in my lifetime I have never felt that people look down on, or I think Congressman Scott used the word as tech schools as being a dumping ground. There may be some segments of society where they are bigoted or, you know, snobbish people look down on people who didn't go to a 4-year degree. I think among me and my peer group, when I was coming up we never had that idea. And I think it is unfortunate that we had people here today use those terms.    But a question for I guess any one of the four of you. One thing that I find in my area is that sometimes when I talk to people who run the local tech schools they talk about people with literally a college degree going back. I know Dr. Major talked about people being an average age 27. I'd like to you to comment as how often you do see people who have a full 4-year degree and eventually realize that they got something without a great deal of value and come back.    Mr. Grothman. Okay. One more question. One thing that people always are concerned about, or at least I feel contributes to the high cost of education today, is the number of nonteaching personnel hired by all institutions of higher learning.    One of the things I wondered about, I notice--well, Dr. Ricks, a couple comments on your testimony. First of all, you say we can no longer afford to educate only an elite class of citizens. That's kind of a damning statement about America and I don't think that's been true throughout my lifetime. Do you really believe in America--or when was the last time you really feel we only educated an elite class of citizens in this country?    Mr. Grothman. Let me cut you off. You're saying something I didn't expect. In other words, you're saying right now it's harder to get through college if you're kind of middle class as opposed to the people who qualify for the Pell Grants? Is that what you're telling us?
