    Ms. Meng. Thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking Member Deutch for calling this hearing and our distinguished witnesses for joining us today. In pursuing legal proceedings against Israel in the International Criminal Court, the Palestinian Authority could do irreparable damage to the peace process and escalate the conflict. Furthermore, I am concerned that the PA's actions here contravene both international law and the spirit of existing agreements between Israel and the PA. We must be clear that joining the ICC is not a viable approach for the Palestinians. I look forward to today's testimony, particularly that relating to the legal questions here. I yield back.
