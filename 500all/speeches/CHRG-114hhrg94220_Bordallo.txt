    Ms. Bordallo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And Secretary LaPlante and General Holmes, thank you for your testimony today. As we proceed with the engineering development of the LRS-B , what are some of the strategies that have gone into developing the $550 million average procurement needed cost cap that you have set? Are you expecting to pursue an arrangement similar to the KC-46, utilizing a fixed price procurement vehicle?    And though the program is one of the Air Force's top three acquisition priorities, in fiscal year 2016 you have requested approximately $1.2 billion for development. What effects would we see to this program if Congress does not repeal sequestration?    Ms. Bordallo. General, my time is up. I do have a question, if I could place it on the record.    Ms. Bordallo. Thank you. Yield back.
