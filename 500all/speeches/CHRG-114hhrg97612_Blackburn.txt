    Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And I am not going to take 5 minutes, and I will yield the time to whomever would like it. But I am going to pick up right where Ms. DeGette left off, talking about Y-12.    And as we conducted that hearing and the assurances that we were given that things were going to be more closely watched, and now we find ourselves, as Chairman Murphy said, looking at a hearing where someone either wasn't paying attention in spelling class or science class or didn't know the difference and went on to inappropriately use an organic kitty litter.    The problem for us is, not only is this expensive--you are talking about $551 billion being the estimate to clean this up, to clean it up, and to get the facility operational--you also look at the impact that this has on nuclear-generated power and on storing that waste.    And in Tennessee, where Y-12 is located--and I was up at Oak Ridge the week before last and over at TVA and out at the Watts Bar Plant. And the safe storage of that nuclear waste, as we bring the second Watts Bar reactor on line--it is about 95 percent complete right now--this is something of tremendous concern.    So we are looking for answers. And I think, more than just answers, we are looking for responsible action and a way to solve this so that best practices and protocols are in place and we are not finding ourselves back at a hearing saying, well, we learned a lesson, but we really didn't learn a lesson, and we took no actions from the lesson we were supposed to learn.    With that, Mr. Chairman, I will yield to the gentleman from Texas.
