    Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I appreciate your testimony today. Thank you very much for being here today.    Mr. Groves, one of the questions I get from my constituents on some of these deals and, in particular, the Iran deal is, how do we know whether an international agreement should be a treaty or an executive agreement?    Mr. Bishop. So how might Congress codify or clarify the treaty process to ensure that the Senate does have that opportunity to provide advice and consent?    Mr. Bishop. Thank you very much.    Mr. Kontorovich, can you explain to us what the current legal status is of the statutory Iran sanctions?    Mr. Bishop. Thank you, sir.    I yield back, Mr. Chair.
