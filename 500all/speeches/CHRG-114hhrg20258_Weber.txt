    Mr. Weber. Thank you, Madam Chair.    Gosh, I am learning some things about Tunisia here today. The population of Tunisia, I guess, is only----    Mr. Weber. About 11 million. How many square miles?    Mr. Weber. Okay. But it can't be bigger than Texas, right? Nothing is bigger----    Mr. Weber. I just want to make sure. So according to my notes, President Obama designated it as a major non-NATO ally. How many major, or non-NATO allies do we currently have? Do you know?    Mr. Weber. So how many NATO allies?    Mr. Weber. So 28 members of NATO, and we have about--and we have designated about--or the President has, or at least at this point there is a dozen non-NATO allies?    Mr. Weber. Okay. So I notice we are doing some things. We are helping them with arms sales. How do we make sure the arms don't fall into the wrong--one of you said, and I don't want to put words--there was 3,000 to 6,000 Tunisians joined extremist groups? Is that right?    Mr. Weber. Is that from 2011 on?    Mr. Weber. Okay. But starting with the quote/unquote----    Mr. Weber. Okay. You said there are 11 million. So 6,000--3,000 to 6,000 have joined.    How are we making sure that the arms that we are helping Tunisia with don't fall into the wrong hands?    Mr. Weber. Which leads me to my next--is it--how do you say your name? Is it----    Mr. Weber. Desrocher. Mr. Desrocher, are any of the political leaders leaving the country? Are they identifiable as part of the that 3,000 to 6,000 route? Any notable defections so to speak?    Mr. Weber. Okay. And then, is it Longi? Is that how you say that?    Mr. Weber. Ms. Longi, you said earlier that your team is going out to design, and I think I am quoting you now, real robust democracy programs or something to that effect. How do you define a real robust democracy program? Tell us about that.    Mr. Weber. Forgive the interruption. But when you say new local governments, states, counties, cities? How do you define those?    Mr. Weber. Municipalities.    Mr. Weber. Let's go back to what you are just now saying. You said you met with the stakeholders. You are talking about citizens, private sectors, NGOs? Can you name four or five different groups of stakeholders?    Mr. Weber. Okay. And then one final question, if I may, Madam Chairman. I am going to run over just a second here. According to my notes, there was a lot of opposition, I guess as they were making a political transition. It says such as trade--from trade unions. What kind of trade unions? I mean, do they have--or is that electrical? Is that plumbing? Is that agricultural? Do you know?    Mr. Weber. Name the kinds of labor. That is my----    Mr. Weber. Name the kinds of labor, that is my specific question----    Mr. Weber. Okay. So they have robust in place of unions?    Mr. Weber. Okay, great. That is it.    Thank you very much.    Mr. Weber. Okay. I also did a Google search. Texas has 268,000 square miles, and Tunisia has 63,000 square. I am just saying.
