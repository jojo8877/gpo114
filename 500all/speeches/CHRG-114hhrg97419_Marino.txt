    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I know my colleague and coauthor, Ms. DelBene, asked direct and pointed questions concerning the LEADS Act, so I don't want to get into rehashing that. But is there anyone on the panel that wants to respond even further because of--given the fact that Ms. DelBene ran out of time? Please.    Mr. Marino. Much.    Mr. Marino. Okay. I'll ask that our staffs review your statement and others to see how we can make this more effective.    Anyone else? Ms. Espinel.    Mr. Marino. I'm not sure if my colleague went into this area. If she did, perhaps you could expand on it; if not, take a shot at it. Give me your impression or what you've heard or what you see or think about the LEADS Act potentially having an adverse effect on U.S. law enforcement, compared to the abilities that they have now to obtain information from other countries? Dr. Atkinson.    Mr. Marino. Ms. Espinel, you have 9 seconds.    Mr. Marino. You have 9 seconds.    Mr. Marino. Thank you. I yield back.
