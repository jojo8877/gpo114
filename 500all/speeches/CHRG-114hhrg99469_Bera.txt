    Mr. Bera. Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and the ranking member.    I had a chance to travel to India with the chairman of the subcommittee as well as the chairman of the full committee last year and, then, recently returned to India a few months ago. And you still feel the sense of optimism in India, the sense that the economy, while it is not a straight shot, is still quite vigorous and vibrant.    I think the chairman's leadership on the resolution that we will be introducing this week to really encourage India's joining of APEC, that probably is the next logical step as they undergo the economic reforms and undergo much of the agenda that Prime Minister Modi has put out there.    For us to realize this potential that both the President and Vice President have said of creating the defining relationship in the 21st century and trying to take the bilateral trade from $100 billion to $500 billion, you know, APEC membership is a good next step. It will take us a little bit longer to get that high-standard Bilateral Investment Treaty, but that certainly is an aspirational goal for both countries and really can set the framework for bilateral trade.    Now, on our side, I urge patience. The economic reforms in India will take time. I think we have to look at this longer time horizon. On the Indian side, we encourage the Prime Minister to continue the economic reforms to ease the ability of our companies to do business, to put in good intellectual property and patent protections that don't hinder that investment and, also, to open up and ease the ability for U.S. resources and U.S. venture to help India realize its potential. I mean, these are all achievable goals. It requires patience on both sides of the Pacific. It requires open dialog. I remain very optimistic that we can reach those goals.    I look forward to hearing the testimony of witnesses who are all experts on this relationship.    Again, I will yield back.
