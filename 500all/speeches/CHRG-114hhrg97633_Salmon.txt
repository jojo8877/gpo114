    Mr. Salmon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    First and foremost, I want to go on the record agreeing wholeheartedly with Mr. Engel that Carly Fiorina could make a great President of the United States. Just having a little fun.    Mr. Salmon. And since Ted Yoho opened up the door on movies, I have two daughters. My oldest is 35, the other one is 30. I think they get really angry for me telling their age, but they are both very well educated, very successful, and they would both be very thrilled to drive a convertible with Brad Pitt in the back.    So, anyway, you have done some phenomenal work, Ms. Davis, raising the profile. Every father that has daughters wants exactly the same opportunities for his daughters that he does for his sons. I have two daughters and two sons, and I want the same thing for all of them. You said that in--maybe confronting is the wrong idea or wrong thought, but you have addressed with some of the leaders in Hollywood the disparity, and you have said that they have kind of referred by citing anecdotes of individual movies or productions. Are you making some headway, do you think, with them in general, and what are some of the things that we could do to maybe aid in that effort?    Mr. Salmon. I think diplomacy is something we all need a little bit more of, and congratulations on that.    Mr. Salmon. Ms. Jorge, as access to the Internet increases around the globe, how can we leverage distance learning to help empower women and girls in the goal of increasing educational opportunities? Can we do more to encourage the development of country-specific distance learning in both basic education as well as university instruction? What specific steps would you recommend?    Mr. Salmon. Thank you. I yield back.
