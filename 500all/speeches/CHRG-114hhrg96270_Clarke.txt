    Ms. Clarke. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and our ranking member, and thank you to all of our witnesses for giving the committee the benefit of your expertise and experience today.    I'd like to focus my questions on the prevention side of the equation, how do we prevent opioid addiction in the first place. So, Dr. Volkow, picking up actually on a point that Mr. Botticelli made just a moment ago about way too many prescriptions, this is to you: Why are so many prescriptions being written for opioids? Are physicians not getting the appropriate level of training and education in pain management for responsible opiate prescribing practices? What would you say?    Ms. Clarke. Very well. Thank you very much.    Director Botticelli, does ONDCP believe that the Federal Government should mandate continuing medical education on responsible opioid prescribing practices as a precondition of DEA registration to prescribe controlled substances? And can you elaborate on how that would work if that's the case?    Ms. Clarke. Very well. Thank you very much.    Dr. Throckmorton, manufacturers of opioid pain relievers are currently required to offer free voluntary education to physicians or responsible opioid prescribing practices. However, as I understand it, physician participation rates for these voluntary educational courses are fairly low. Is that correct?    Ms. Clarke. Very well. I yield back. Thank you very much.
