    Mr. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, witnesses. Thank you, Doctor, for your service, and, Ambassador, for yours also.    Very briefly, I never got to see you in Iraq, but I was over there at the same time that you were. And most of this focuses on the defense or making sure that we protect our national interests in agriculture. But there is also a very strategic interest in the way that we use agriculture as a tool, as an offensive tool to help us in our strategic interests overseas. I had a young captain, who was older than me, but a captain in Iraq, Captain Jessie Cornelius, who was an agriculture teacher at home, during my first tour in Iraq, and I dealt mostly with the Al-Hillah Embassy there, but he was very, very good in understanding how we could use agriculture as an offensive tool to help plug into the culture there in Iraq and help them learn how to irrigate better. So I would be interested not just in the defensive aspects, but how we can use agriculture either in combination with our military units, or also as civilian organizations to strategically help the United States in other regions.    Mr. Kelly. Thank you. And then, Ambassador, just very briefly, U.S. agriculture is critical to our infrastructure here in the United States. A nation that can feed itself is a nation that can survive anything--logistics. What do you see as our major vulnerabilities to outside threats, in a minute please?    Mr. Kelly. From outside threats.    Mr. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I yield back.    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.    Mr. Peterson, 5 minutes.
