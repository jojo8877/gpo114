    Mr. Gosar. Yes.    The Clerk. Mr. Gosar votes yes.    Mr. DesJarlais?    The Clerk. Mr. Gowdy?    Mr. Gosar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Higgins, CIA collects a great deal of human intelligence. That is, it collects information from foreign individuals often at the risk of that individual's life. Is that true?    Mr. Gosar. Are you aware that the State Department released some unclassified emails from Secretary Clinton with a FOIA redaction that said, quote, B3CIApersons/org? Are you aware of that?    Mr. Gosar. So let me get this straight. So CIApersons/org means information redacted with sensitive information about an individual organization affiliated with the CIA, correct?    Mr. Gosar. Okay. So if information from a single or small group of CIA officers or agents makes it to our adversaries, that could present a huge risk for their safety, right?    Mr. Gosar. But potentially. I mean, given that circumstance, it could potentially have some serious ramifications for those people.    Mr. Gosar. Oh, but that's hardly--I mean, a classification that we can't talk about right here, is it?    Mr. Gosar. So to some degree, protection of classified information is life or death?    Mr. Gosar. Okay. And even a few sentences from a source could reveal the--could expose that source, true?    Mr. Gosar. But it could?    Mr. Gosar. Okay. So would you say that someone who treats information with our spies abroad exceptionally carelessly should be trusted with a security clearance?    Mr. Gosar. Well, I just--I watched the chairman ask each one of you gentlemen and ladies, going back over classified, did you remove any information out of a SCIF or any documentation. And those that said yes, said, hey, you went back. There were some seriousness to it, right?    Mr. Gosar. Say that one more time.    Mr. Gosar. Really?    Mr. Gosar. So why are we here?    Mr. Gosar. No, no, no, no. So why are we here? Because we have a Secretary of State that had a whole server that was offline. Kind of unusual, wouldn't you say?    Mr. Gosar. That's fine.    Mr. Soule----    Mr. Gosar. --NSA is tasked with collecting intelligence electronically through signals. Is that correct?    Mr. Gosar. Would leaking signals intelligence damage national security?    Mr. Gosar. What if the person looking at the intelligence thought the information in question wasn't important? Is that a valid excuse for leaking signals intelligence?    Mr. Gosar. Leaking any signals intelligence can reveal our signals intelligence capabilities so that even if information collected by NSA seem innocuous. Is that correct?    Mr. Gosar. It still should be treated as classified, true?    Mr. Gosar. Has the NSA ever lost an important intelligence collection tool--been burned is the quote--because classified information about that method made it into the wrong hands?    Mr. Gosar. Would you say that someone who treats NSA signals intelligence exceptionally carelessly should be trusted with a security clearance?    Mr. Gosar. Okay. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
