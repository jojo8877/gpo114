    Mr. Stivers. Chairman Salmon, Ranking Member Sherman, distinguished members of the subcommittee, and Mr. Crowley, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the role of USAID in strengthening democracy, human rights, and governance in Asia. The vital importance of these areas has always been close to my heart and the forefront of my nearly two decades of work as a staffer in the House of Representatives.    The House Foreign Affairs Committee has long been at the forefront on democracy and human rights issues, and some of the strongest voices on human rights in U.S. history have done their best work on this panel.    Mr. Chairman, this hearing is in furtherance of that tradition, so thank you for your leadership in holding this hearing.    Dr. Martin Luther King once said that ``The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.'' This is certainly true in Southeast Asia which has made significant progress over the last 30 years. There is a unique situation in each country of the region to either preserve, consolidate, or build democratic institutions.    The United States stands as a partner in helping the people in Asia live in freedom and prosperity, including in countries with significant democratic challenges such as Burma and Cambodia.    In the fight to alleviate extreme poverty, it is essential to effectively address the underlying structural problems with governance that hold back many developing countries from realizing their potential. The solutions to challenges will ultimately come from the people of the region themselves, and our best chance in promoting democratic change is to empower the reformers in these countries by helping them build resilient institutions that are transparent and accountable to the people.    The promotion of democracy, human rights, and good governance is front and center in our development assistance to the region. And efforts not necessarily branded as democracy promotion, help advance that goal as we build systems and capacity to address overwhelming development challenges, including support for health and food-security sectors.    Our development assistance engages directly with the people and helps give them a voice in determining their own livelihoods and future. For the purposes of this hearing, I will focus my remarks on the countries of Burma and Cambodia.    In Burma, this is a pivotal year. Closely calibrated with our diplomatic efforts, our assistance is intended to strengthen institutions of democracy. USAID is helping to prepare for the November elections by building the capacity of the election commission; training domestic election observers; supporting voter registration and education; and strengthening the capacity of political parties.    USAID continues to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable communities, including significant assistance for the Rohingya population, refugees, and displaced people along the Thailand-Burma border and other conflict areas of Burma. Over the past 2 years the U.S. Government has provided more than $109 million in humanitarian assistance to vulnerable people in Burma and the region. And we continue to provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons, refugees, asylum seekers in the areas of health, nutrition, water, sanitization, and hygiene.    An emphasis on civil society is prevalent through all of our work, from media freedoms to land policy to health and agriculture. And we are supporting organizations that are holding the government accountable to continued reform; advocating for local needs and priorities; and resisting discrimination and violence.    To date, USAID has supported over 300 vocal civil society organizations who are empowering ordinary citizens to bring change to their country.    In Cambodia, promoting democratic governance and human rights continues to be our highest priority. U.S. assistance to human rights NGOs have strengthened their skills necessary to advocate effectively for change. While not fully respected by the Cambodian Government, Cambodian civil society has grown in strength and inclusiveness. Since the 1990s, we have supported civil society, and we continue to prioritize assistance to this sector. Cambodian civil society, with USAID support, has pressed for action on key issues, such as support for human rights, by providing legal representation, trial monitoring, and advocacy support to over 1,000 jailed activists.    Our longstanding support for anti-trafficking is paying dividends with a new report finding significant decreases in trafficking of underaged girls. The reduction was achieved in large part by civil societies' sustained efforts.    In part, due to U.S. support, garment workers negotiated a 28-percent increase in minimum wage that was approved last year.    Community mobilization and legal support resulted in the government returning land to more than 700 families in Siem Reap Province, providing them with land tenure security and improved livelihood options. And advocacy resulted in a pardon and release of 10 female land activists recently who had been imprisoned for protesting their community from being evicted due to real estate development projects.    In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, democracy, human rights, and good governance are not only central to the Asia rebalance policy but to our development approach in Asia. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and any questions.    ----------                                  Mr. Stivers. Sure, thank you, Mr. Chairman. In terms of that situation from 2014, I remember it back then. It is my understanding that that situation was resolved, but let me check on that and get you the facts on that. But I agree with you that it is absolutely essential that all of our contractors and all of our contracts have the highest standards in terms of where they are getting rent from and the buildings that they are occupying. And I can assure you that in our contracting, we take a very close look and make that a high priority. But I will get you more details.    Mr. Stivers. Four.    Mr. Stivers. Thank you for that question. The Fiscal Year 2016 budget request includes increases in democracy and governance funding for almost every country in East Asia. And the requests over the last few years have done the same.    It is not a secret that the overall cuts to foreign assistance in recent years have had an impact on overall discretionary funding, which is primarily democracy and governance funding, and economic growth funding. And so there are a number of issues in the final budget that is concluded by the administration and both Houses of Congress that have affected our discretionary spending and our flexibility to provide the democratic and governance funding that does so much, especially in support of civil society.    In Burma and Cambodia, for example, we are doing so much to support civil society including promoting gender empowerment and fighting against trafficking. We are supporting many organizations that work on those sorts of issues. But the funding is an issue when we consider the budget.
