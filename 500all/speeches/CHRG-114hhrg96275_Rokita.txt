    Mr. Rokita. I thank the chairman, and I appreciate the witness testimony today and also from the first panel as well.    I give my apologies. Today in three committees and starting yesterday actually where we are getting ready to employ a concept called reconciliation, and the Workforce Committee just did its part of the reconciliation process for this year that originated in the Budget Committee that I am also a part of. So it was a busy day for a lot of us. No excuse, but just want you to know where I was before this.    And even though I was distracted by the gentleman from my left and though I associate with him regularly, I was able to hear a little bit of your testimony, and so I would like to focus my questions I think mostly, and no offense to anyone else, but I want to focus my questions directly to Mr. Lord if that is OK.    Reading your statement last night, you talk about the number of jobs that can be created on the Great Lakes due to these restoration projects. I am from Munster, Indiana, Lake County. So we are right up there, grew up there, and I would like to think I appreciate the cultural value, the economic value, the environmental value of those lakes.    But this committee and this subcommittee is new to me. I want to understand more when you say this will create jobs. Do you mean to imply that these restoration efforts are going to go on in perpetuity or is there some day when this ends, therefore technically making the jobs temporary?    Yes, that is a trick question.    Mr. Rokita. So in your mind, when is enough enough? When would you be satisfied definitionally that the restoration has, in fact, occurred? When these 20 projects are done?    Mr. Rokita. You have got 2 minutes.    Mr. Rokita. Thank you.    Would anyone else like to jump in my line of questioning in terms of response? Mr. Allan?    Mr. Rokita. Anyone else?    Mr. Rokita. Anyone else for 10 seconds?    Mr. Rokita. Thank you. My time has expired. Appreciate it.
