    Mr. Israel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I hope to be one day one of the most read authors in Washington.    Madam Secretary, welcome. I wanted to shift to an issue that generally has bipartisan support on this subcommittee, committee, and in Congress, and that is wildlife trafficking. You and I attended an Ivory Crush in Times Square, New York City, over the summer. I have been working on a bipartisan basis with Jeff Fortenberry from Nebraska on this issue. Many of us support additional resources for wildlife trafficking not only because it is a humanitarian thing to do, but because we are learning that wildlife trafficking is providing revenue streams to terrorist organizations around the world.    And I just want to ask you this one very simple question: Tell us what your budget does with respect to wildlife trafficking. Do you have the resources that you need?    Mr. Israel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Israel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Director.    Director, the President's budget includes a proposal to make it easier for the Department of Interior to transfer wild horses to local, and State, and other Federal agencies to be used as work animals. I am concerned that if the proposal is not effectively implemented, it will simply make it easier for those horses to ultimately be sent to slaughter. And I would appreciate it if you would tell us what safeguards will be instituted so that we know that these horses will remain safe.    Mr. Israel. The proposal as it is currently constructed does not have that requirement?    Mr. Israel. I want to make sure I understand this. So when somebody adopts a wild horse, as I understand what you just said, there is a requirement that they commit not to send that horse to slaughter. Are you saying that there is a distinction if the animal is transferred to a public agency, that requirement is not currently----    Mr. Israel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.
