    Mr. Keating. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to thank Mr. Trott and Mr. Deutch for their leadership in introducing the Strategy to Oppose Predatory Organ Trafficking Act. Too often vulnerable individuals are coerced or forced into supporting this illicit trade. And just in a world where you think things can't get much worse, you see this kind of coerced or forced activity really hurt victims who are typically poor or unemployed. Some of them indeed were known to include children.    Countries must have an effective law on the books if we are to protect against future victims of this trade, and it is crucial that countries then enforce these laws so that perpetrators do not continue to target vulnerable individuals with impunity. My amendment adds to the bill a report on host country enforcement of these laws against trafficking of persons for the removal of organs.    Finally, I would like to thank all the sponsors of the four additional bills being considered this morning, all of which I support. These pieces of legislation will have important consequences in advancing human rights, security policy, and U.S. engagement abroad.    And I do want to say, in a Congress that is often stymied on its ability to act, this committee continues to move forward and stands out in that regard for working cooperatively and in a bipartisan fashion to really address very important issues. I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for that as well.    And I yield back.
