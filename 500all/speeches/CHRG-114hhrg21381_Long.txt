    Mr. Long. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And Mr. McGuire could you recommend to me what type of hair dryer would be the best purchase for my dishwasher so I could dry my dishes whenever the cycle is through?    Mr. Long. My dishes are not feeling the burn as they once did.    Mr. Cosgriff, in some of the testimony given today, the issue of the Department of Energy coordinating better with other agency was mentioned as an area for improvement, particularly in the area of making sure that imported products containing regulated components are held at the same standards as the domestically manufactured products are on their own. What are your thoughts on how we can ensure a level playing field for U.S. made components?    Mr. Long. Can you pull your mike a little closer?    Mr. Long. Well the energy conservation standards program required the Department of Energy to start a new rulemaking procedure on a product as part of 6-year review cycle. Can you tell me generally how long it takes to fully comply with the energy conservation standards for a product factoring in all of the cumulative rules, including test procedures?    Mr. Long. What are some of the challenges in complying with both the energy conservation standards and additional test procedures?    Mr. Long. Welcome to Washington, DC. Mr. Cosgriff, do you care to comment on that as to what the challenges are?    Mr. Long. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
