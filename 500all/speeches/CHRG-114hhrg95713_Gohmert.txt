    Mr. Gohmert. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will come to order.    This subcommittee is meeting today to hear testimony on accountability, policies, and tactics of law enforcement within the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service.    Under Committee Rule 4(f), any oral statements at this hearing are limited to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member. This will allow us to hear from our witnesses sooner and let Members keep to their schedules.    Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that all other Members' opening statements for this meeting be made part of the hearing record if they are submitted to the Subcommittee Clerk by 5:00 p.m. today.    Hearing no objection, so ordered.    Also, I politely ask that everyone in this hearing please silence your cell phones. Make sure that there is nothing that goes off. When I was a judge, I would have my bailiff confiscate any phones that went off; and then you had to do a couple hundred hours of community service to get it back. I do not have a bailiff here as such; so I just have to ask that you keep your cell phone silent, please. Thank you.    All right. I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes for an opening statement.    Mr. Gohmert. Today we are discussing the accountability of law enforcement within our land management agencies. I would like to recognize from the start the important work of hundreds of law enforcement employees from the Department of the Interior to the U.S. Forest Service. These men and women risk everything to protect our iconic landmarks, natural resources, as well as critical energy infrastructure.    Just last year, 38-year-old Forest Service Officer Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner were killed while pursuing an armed murder suspect. That was a horrible tragedy, and his sacrifice should be remembered by all of us.    Clearly, there are many, many excellent officers out there just doing their job day in and day out. Unfortunately, we have come to learn of situations that place local law enforcement officers at odds with their Federal counterparts.    I would like to enter into the record an article from the Salt Lake Tribune published in October of 2014, entitled ``Utah to BLM: Rein in Your Cops.''    The article begins, ``Public Enemy No. 1 for rural Utah sheriffs just happens to be a fellow peace officer named Dan Love, the Bureau of Land Management's special agent in charge.''    Utah to BLM: Rein in your copsBy Brian MafflyThe Salt Lake TribunePublished October 19, 2014 10:12 amLaw enforcement <bullet> Sheriffs say federal rangers overstep their         authority and blame Utah-Nevada special agent for escalation of         conflicts.    Public Enemy No. 1 for rural Utah sheriffs just happens to be a fellow peace officer: Dan Love, the Bureau of Land Management's special agent in charge.    Elected law enforcement officers from Nephi to Blanding call him an arrogant and dishonest bully who has little regard for local authority and dodges accountability, derailing a collaborative approach to police work on the state's federal lands.    Love reportedly just laughed when Garfield County Sheriff James ``Danny'' Perkins relayed ranchers' complaints about federal officers removing plastic feed tubs from the range and threatening the ranchers with litter citations.    He drew early controversy during an undercover probe of artifacts trafficking in Blanding in 2009. More recently, Love led the BLM's aborted roundup of Cliven Bundy's cattle following an armed standoff with anti-government protesters at the Utah-Nevada border.    While tensions with federal authority are hardly new to Utah, local officials say friction has intensified with Love at the helm of BLM law enforcement in Utah and Nevada.    Now top state officials want Love gone. ``This is untenable,'' said Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox. ``There comes a time when personalities get in the way of productivity.''    For his part, Love is not talking.    Local officials may share some of the blame for the poor relations. According to court filings, elected leaders and even deputies have confronted BLM rangers, publicly challenging their authority.    But Love's critics say his intimidating attitude and unwillingness to consult with counties exemplify a ``culture of arrogance'' that undermines cooperation in Utah's remote reaches. The public loses, safety is compromised and tax dollars are wasted, Utah's rural sheriffs say.    ``This refusal to coordinate, coupled with a lack of any meaningful oversight, has created a perfect environment where the abuse of federal law enforcement powers can occur,'' Perkins recently testified before a congressional committee.    For example, Perkins and San Juan County Sheriff Rick Eldredge say, rangers pull over citizens without probable cause, even in areas where they have no jurisdiction, ``bully'' ranch hands, berate tourists for parking vehicles off dirt roads and illegally close roads. Federal officers refuse to help with searches and rescues, or when they do, they get in the way.    BLM law enforcement officials would not speak on the record, but an agency spokeswoman said BLM does takes complaints seriously.    ``When we receive specifics regarding these allegations, we look into the incidents and take corrective action if appropriate,'' Celia Boddington said. ``However, it is difficult for us to address allegations when they are either not reported to us or reported several months after the event.''    Still, the agency is revising its command structure to make law enforcement responsive to local concerns.    ``We enjoy positive and constructive relations with the majority of sheriffs,'' Boddington said, ``and couldn't get our job done without working closely with them and their teams.''----    Broken accords <bullet> One recent flap surrounding Love stems from the contracts the BLM signs with some sheriff's departments, compensating them for patrolling public lands and conducting searches and rescues.    State and local officials allege Love recently ``terminated'' such contracts with five counties as retribution for the state's enactment last year of HB155, which limits the authority of officers employed by federal land agencies.    While discussing the contracts with BLM's top law enforcement official, Salvatore Lauro, recently, Cox asked him to assign a new special agent in charge for Utah.    ``They are not willing to make that replacement at this time,'' Cox said, ``but they are willing to work toward improving those relations.''    The lieutenant governor said he and other state officials have negotiated face to face with Love, and have gotten nowhere.    ``If I was going to battle, I'd want him beside me,'' Cox told a recent meeting of Utah's Commission on Federalism. ``But I don't want him instigating a war.''    Love has declined lawmakers' invitation to speak at legislative committees. BLM officials won't discuss individual employees and wouldn't make Love available for an interview.    But they denied retribution played any role in the contract decisions.    According to Boddington, the BLM allowed the contracts to expire after higher-ups found them legally defective during routine reviews. Agreements with Kane, San Juan, Emery, Juab and Grand county sheriffs--worth about $178,000 a year--expired in 2012.    ``The BLM's review of the contracts was underway prior to the bill introduction,'' she said. ``There is no connection of any kind between our review and HB155.''    To patrol Utah's 23 million acres of public lands, the BLM employs 15 uniformed rangers or field officers. Seven special agents who investigate violations of federal law related to public lands and natural resources also work for BLM, which administers about 40 percent of Utah's land base. All report in varying degrees to Love, who has served in the top spot for less than a decade.    ----    Threat to public safety? <bullet> The situation has become so tense, or perhaps juvenile, that federal and local officers sometimes threaten to arrest each other.    Garfield and at least three other counties have passed resolutions declaring federal authority unwelcome, alleging BLM law enforcement presents a threat to ``health, safety and welfare.''    Retired rangers say the tensions date back to the 1970s, when the BLM began assigning field rangers. Controversial BLM operations, such as the artifact raids in Blanding or the Bundy standoff at Bunkerville, Nev., bring ``long-simmering'' resentments to the surface, said Ed Patrovsky, who patrolled the 3.2-million-acre Craig district spanning parts of nine northwest Colorado counties.    ``The problems lie on both sides,'' Patrovsky said. ``Some sheriffs are territorial. They see federal officers as competitors rather than cooperators. Some of the federal officers come in with the same attitude.''    He said the BLM's hiring patterns in the past two decades have contributed to the problem. Instead of recruiting rangers from other land agencies, it now tends to tap agencies such as the Border Patrol and Bureau of Prisons.    ``They are hiring rangers that don't have the natural resource ethic that ties them to the land,'' Patrovsky said.    Still, today's widespread anti-federal sentiment complicates rangers' jobs.    ``Things can snowball and gather their own momentum without any fault on the part of the ranger,'' said Patrovsky, who was deputized by the Moffat County sheriff during his years in Craig. ``There is an atmosphere of fear and intimidation out there and rangers are afraid to speak out.''    It is common for Utah sheriffs to deputize U.S. Forest Service and National Park Service officers, but no BLM rangers are currently deputized in Utah.----    `He had no jurisdiction' <bullet> BLM arrest statistics seem to undermine claims of an overbearing presence. Rangers made just three arrests in Utah in 2012, and issued 27 citations and 110 warnings.    County officials, however, say they are more concerned with incidents that don't wind up in court, but illustrate a lack of respect toward the sheriff's role as a county's chief law enforcement officer. At a recent congressional hearing, Garfield County Commissioner Leland Pollock likened BLM law enforcement operations to ``the Gestapo.''    Perkins said tourists have complained they will never return to Garfield County after their treatment by rangers in the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument.    In his legislative testimony, Eldredge said a BLM ranger confronted him on his family's property adjacent to BLM land and the Ute Mountain Ute community. The ranger, who didn't recognize the sheriff, erroneously admonished Eldredge against driving on tribal land. The ranger backed off and apologized when Eldredge identified himself, but the sheriff was in no forgiving mood.    ``He didn't even know whose land it was,'' Eldredge told lawmakers earlier this month. ``He just wanted to give me a bad time. Even if it was , he had no jurisdiction to tell me stay off.''    Many county leaders don't hesitate to praise BLM Utah Director Juan Palma, regarded as a warm public servant committed to bridging the federal-state divide.    But whatever goodwill Palma builds, Love and officers under his command put a match to it, local officials say.    Pollock points to an effort by Garfield County officials to hammer out a law enforcement contract with the BLM, similar to the agency's agreement with neighboring Kane County. Garfield County is also home to the Grand Staircase monument, and last year, its six-deputy department spent $70,000 on helicopter time and 265 staff hours rescuing monument visitors.    Love refused to execute a contract, according to Pollock.    ``We budgeted based on my negotiations with Juan Palma, and all of the sudden he said he couldn't do it,'' Pollock said. ``That's sick and wrong. We hired a deputy that would have made the Grand Staircase a safer place, and this one guy killed it.''    Meanwhile, Perkins contends the BLM ranger assigned to the county refuses to coordinate with deputies on searches and rescues. He once prematurely called in a helicopter, Perkins said, which sat idle for four hours before it returned to base, refueled, and came back with another pilot.----    BLM cops and civilians <bullet> Counties also complain that BLM law enforcement operates at cross purposes with its own civilian land-management staff.    Perkins and Pollock cited an incident where a ranger posted roads with closed signs shortly before the opening of a limited entry hunt. Locals complained to the BLM field manager, who determined that the roads should be open, according to the sheriff.    But when the manager took down the signs, the BLM ranger threatened to arrest him. The ranger kept his hand on his holster as if preparing to draw his service weapon, Perkins said, and the BLM manager told the sheriff he felt his life was in danger.    In a more documented case, BLM law enforcement clashed with civilian colleagues in Garfield County over a dead body.    Love and a team of FBI agents unearthed human remains discovered in the national monument in 2008, reasoning the site could be a crime scene. The monument archaeologist objected, however, believing the site was likely historic and any excavation should have been led by scientists.    The archaeologist was baffled that law enforcement did not notify him of their plans, and that Love failed to return his phone calls, according to BLM documents obtained through a records request.    The archaeologist was excluded as the cops dug up the body with a TV crew filming. The remains turned out to be that of an American Indian who died in the 19th century.    All sides agree better cooperation would minimize such disagreements and make the job of law enforcement easier. The challenge will be re-establishing trust.                                 ______                                     It may seem improbable that a single officer could become so notorious, but hearings right here in this committee have confirmed that the BLM is able to ignore the authority of local sheriffs and other elected officials without repercussions.    One county commissioner described their issues with BLM as ``bullying, intimidation and a lack of integrity.''    Appeals from the highest levels of the Utah state government were met with open ears from Bureau officials, but zero action was taken. This particular officer continues to make new friends and has popped up in the news again for his adoration of Choco Tacos and demands for superstar treatment at outdoor hippie festivals.    We could easily conclude that this was just one rogue officer and surely he will be dealt with, but that is not the case. If we have a system that allows this to continue, then these accountability issues will remain unchanged and repeated. In fact, I have heard surprising stories from local authorities and government officials in my own district regarding abuses or callous ignoring of the needs of local officials who have difficulty getting needed cooperation from Federal authorities in charge of land within their county.    Once we come to a better understanding of how these problems have been able to persist, we can move to a suitable corrective action. We have four witnesses today offering a variety of perspectives with experience we value. From their testimony we will hear how something in the implementation of this ``stove-piping'' of authority is foiling responsive, efficient, and accountable performance. I invite our witnesses to tell us how this can be better understood and addressed.    I am also concerned that Federal law enforcement have actively usurped state authority. I want to know how this occurs and how it must stop. Local sheriffs are elected and held accountable by their constituents. Regardless of the party in the White House, Federal officers' accountability only seems to be present if there is adequate congressional oversight and if congressional consequences exist for any impropriety. Even so, it is nearly impossible to dismiss a Federal employee.    At some point, we will welcome input from the Administration; but it is my understanding that they were unwilling to send representatives from the sub-agencies we requested to testify at this hearing. That type of callousness is the very type that we must either stop, or defund the noncompliant bureau, agency, or department.    Nevertheless, we will continue to dialog and look forward to uncovering ways to bring accountability to Federal law enforcement.    Mr. Gohmert. At this time I would like to call upon our Ranking Member, Mrs. Dingell, for her opening statement.    Mr. Gohmert. I thank the Ranking Member very much for her opening statement.    Now I will introduce the witnesses. We are very pleased that you arrived here, and have done so voluntarily; and obviously, you do not come for the big bucks because you do not even get reimbursed. That is why we appreciate so much your appearance here today, all four of you. Thank you.    First we have Sheriff Dave Brown of Skamania County, Washington. We also have Mr. Russ Ehnes, who is the Executive Director at the National Off-Highway Vehicle Conservation Council. Next is Mr. Christopher Schoppmeyer, who is the Vice President of Agency Affairs at the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. And finally, we have Mr. Paul Larkin, Jr., who is the Senior Legal Research Fellow with the Edwin Meese Center for Legal and Justice Studies at The Heritage Foundation.    Let me remind the witnesses that, under our Committee Rules, oral statements are limited to 5 minutes. You have a timer in front of you. Your written statements--I know that my colleague and I both do late night work in preparation, and we have read your statements. We are greatly appreciative of your written statements, and those will be entered as part of the record, regardless of whether you get that finished within 5 minutes or not. If you care to expand on that within your 5 minutes and bring up something that is not in the written testimony, it will still be part of the record.    When you begin the light on the witness table will be green. When you have 1 minute remaining, the yellow light will come on, and when your time has expired, the red light comes on. At that time it will be gaveled to complete.    So the Chair recognizes Sheriff Brown for your opening statement. You are recognized for 5 minutes, Sheriff. Thanks for being here.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you very much, Sheriff. I appreciate that statement.    At this time we will now hear from Mr. Ehnes. You are recognized to testify for 5 minutes, sir.    Thank you.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you. I appreciate your testimony.    At this time we will hear from Mr. Schoppmeyer. You are recognized for 5 minutes for testimony.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you.    I will now hear from Mr. Larkin. You are recognized for 5 minutes to testify, sir.    Thank you.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you very much, Mr. Larkin.    We appreciate all of your testimony today. At this time we are going to move into questioning by the Members. I am going to be here for the duration of the hearing, so I am going to recognize first my colleague and my friend from Georgia, Mr. Hice, for 5 minutes for questions.    Mr. Gohmert. Without objection, so ordered.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you.    At this time we will recognize the Ranking Member, Congresswoman Dingell, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you.    At this time I will recognize Mrs. Radewagen for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you very much.    At this time the Chair recognizes Mr. Gallego for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you.    Along those lines, we received a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union; and, after consulting with the Ranking Member, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be added for the record. It is interesting when The Heritage and ACLU agree on a subject like this.    ACLU--American Civil Liberties Union,                                            Washington, DC,                                                     July 28, 2015.Hon. Louie Gohmert, Chairman,House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,Committee on Natural Resources,1324 Longworth House Office Building,Washington, DC 20515.Hon. Debbie Dingell, Ranking Member,House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,Committee on Natural Resources,1324 Longworth House Office Building,Washington, DC 20515.Re: ACLU Requests Examination of Interior's Acquisition of Military         Weapons and Equipment    Dear Chairman Gohmert and Ranking Member Dingell:    The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) commends the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee for holding a hearing on ``Accountability, Policies, and Tactics of Law Enforcement within the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the U.S. Forest Service.'' We ask that the Committee examine the relationship between DOI and the Department of Defense (DOD) 1033 program, which provides military weapons and equipment to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. We have concerns with the militarization of DOI bureaus like the National Park Service (NPS), which has acquired 4,100 pieces of military equipment worth approximately $6 million over the past 25 years.\1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \1\ Matthew Renda, Does Yosemite Really Need $435,000 of Military Equipment?, The Edge, January 7, 2014.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    The ACLU believes that the line between military and law enforcement cannot be blurred. Our opposition to militarization is consistent with the ACLU's nearly 100 year old mission to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties that the Constitution and the laws of the United States guarantee everyone in this country. As the nation's guardian of liberty, and with more than a million members, activists, and supporters nationwide, the ACLU advances the principle that every individual's rights must be protected equally under the law, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or national origin.    The DOD 1033 Program is authorized by Section 1033 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1997. It permits the Secretary of Defense to transfer, without charge, excess DOD supplies and equipment to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.\2\ Since the 1990s, the Defense Logistics Agency has transferred excess military equipment to approximately 8,000 federal and state law enforcement agencies and has provided $5.1 B in total property.\3\ This equipment includes but is not limited to, military-grade vehicles, grenades, assault rifles, and night vision equipment.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \2\ The White House, Review: Federal Support for Local Law Enforcement Equipment Acquisition, December 2014, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/federal_support_for_local_law_enforcement_equipment_acquisition.pdf.    \3\ Id.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    We have concerns that this program has led to militarized policing, which we raise in our recent report, War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing \4\. As the nation watched Ferguson Missouri, in the aftermath of the death of Michael Brown, it saw a dangerously militarized response by law enforcement. However, militarized policing is not limited to state and local law enforcement. For example, in 2010, a multi-agency taskforce, including armed officers from the Food and Drug Agency, raided a Venice, California organic grocery store suspected of using raw milk.\5\ The following year, armed federal agents with the Department of Education's OIG smashed down the door of a Stockton, California home and handcuffed a man suspected of student financial aid fraud.\6\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \4\ See ACLU, War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing, June 23, 2014, available at https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-re11.pdf.    \5\ P.J. Huffstutter, Raw-food raid Highlights a Hunger, The Los Angeles Times, July 25, 2010.    \6\ Elizabeth Flock, Education Department Agents Raids California Home, The Washington Post, June 8, 2011.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    We are concerned by the relationship between the DOD 1033 program and some of the Department of Interior agencies. While the National Park Service handbook explicitly limits the agency's ability to acquire firearms ``to the minimum needed for an effective law enforcement program,'' the service has obtained thousands of handguns, high-powered assault rifles, bayonets, and shotguns through this program. And unfortunately, an exact accounting of these thousands of weapons is not known as a 2013 Inspector General report identified a poorly managed inventory.\7\---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \7\ Supra note 1.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    We fear that the acquisition of military weapons and equipment increases the potential for excessive policing, such as the 2013 raid of a small mining operation in Chicken, Alaska. During this raid, a heavily armed and armored multi-agency taskforce, including officers from the National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service, descended upon several mines to search for Clean Water Act violations.\8\ Alaska Governor Sean Parnell voiced his deep concern, noting that the use of armed and body-armor-wearing officers who were relatively unfamiliar with the area put people at risk.\9\ We worry that these events will only become more frequent and dangerous with the continued acquisition of military equipment by law enforcement at all levels.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \8\ Valerie Richardson, EPA Facing Fire for Armed Raid on Mine in Chicken, Alaska: Population 7.

Alaska Dispatch News, March 13, 2014.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    The ACLU understands the desire to ensure the safety of both federal employees and civilians but we question the necessity of military-grade equipment in achieving that end. Through greater transparency, more oversight, policies that encourage restraint, and limitations on federal incentives, we can foster a law enforcement culture that honors its mission to protect and serve.    We appreciate the Subcommittee's commitment to ensuring accountability in law enforcement as demonstrated by the call for a hearing and respectfully request an examination of the relationship between DOD 1033 and the Department of the Interior. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Kanya Bennett, Legislative Counsel.            Sincerely,                                   Michael W. Macleod-Ball,                                                   Acting Director.                                             Kanya Bennett,                                               Legislative Counsel.                                 ______                                     Mr. Gohmert. At this time the Chair recognizes Mr. Mooney for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. I thank the gentleman.    At this time the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Westerman, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you.    At this time, I will recognize the Chairman of the Full Committee, the distinguished Chairman Bishop, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. I thank the Chairman.    I recognize myself for 5 minutes.    Following that up, it does seem rather ridiculous that there would be any area in the country where a resolution of conflict would be resolved after many years or even decades of service by one individual, that he finally retires and that makes things better.    I know Mr. Schoppmeyer mentioned that you do not find FBI in the woods. But in east Texas, in my own personal experience--having been a prosecutor, a judge, and a chief justice, I have seen and read lots of testimony; I have talked to law enforcement officers. We often have FBI in the woods because, Sheriff, they do exactly what you are talking about you would like to see between locals and Federal officers, and that is they meet together and they talk, and when there is a problem, they get together and they coordinate.    But here again, that also, as you being law enforcement would know, takes sometimes a trust. With the FBI, that suffered back during the Bush administration under Director Mueller, who back then had a 5-year ``up or out'' policy. We would get somebody good, the local law enforcement would start to trust him, and then they would be up or out.    I complained bitterly about that policy. It has changed now, but, Sheriff, do you have any formal proposal as to how that structure might be set up between local and Federal officials to coordinate better?    Mr. Gohmert. Sheriff, my time is running out, but let me direct you specifically to the Gibson guitar case, where as I understand, that was a Lacey Act enforcement; and you have Federal law enforcement come busting in, armed to the teeth, and people are just making guitars.    If, in a situation like that, you were notified that in your county somebody was manufacturing guitars and there was concern that they were using wood that was not properly imported, would you be willing to send a deputy along with people in suits and no weapons as they went in and asked for records from the guitar maker?    Mr. Gohmert. So, that can be done without arming the Federal people to the teeth, correct?    Mr. Gohmert. I agreed with so much in the letter from the ACLU and so much that conforms to what, Mr. Larkin, you have said with one exception. I have seen the difference that it can make when local law enforcement, and I would also presume with Federal officials, if they have defensive equipment from the military, say, bulletproof vests.    Would you have a problem with defensive equipment being provided?    Mr. Gohmert. All right. Thank you.    My time has expired. Let me consult with the Ranking Member.    I recognize the Ranking Member for a unanimous consent.    Mr. Gohmert. So the request was for the testimony?    Mr. Gohmert. Without objection, so ordered.    Mr. Gohmert. And the ACLU letter, without objection, is entered as part of the record.    Hearing nothing further at this time, we appreciate all of your testimony. We appreciate your time here. If you have anything additionally you would like to have entered into the record, then please submit that. The record will be open for 10 business days for these responses, and that is under Committee Rule 4(h).    If there is nothing further in the way of further business, without objection, the committee stands adjourned. Thank you.
