    Mr. Lance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And good morning to you, Mr. Wilkins.    The FCC makes a one-time request of $51 million for restacking, and is this similar--for move or restacking. Are a move or restacking equivalent, and which of the two would be less costly?    Mr. Lance. Are these competitively bid, or to the lowest responsible bidder, or----    Mr. Lance. Well, thank you. At your convenience, we would appreciate if you would provide us with a list of the awardees. And----    Mr. Lance. We appreciate that, thank you. The budget request includes $2.4 million to engage an administrator to manage the Broadcast Relocation Fund.    Mr. Lance. Is this going to be awarded through a competitive bidding process----    Mr. Lance . As well?    Mr. Lance. Thank you. That ends my question. Anybody on our side wants the balance of my time?    Mr. Lance. I will yield back.
