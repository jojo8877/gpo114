    Ms. Clarke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank our ranking member. I thank Mr. Wilkins for coming today to share information with us.    I am a new member to this committee, and wanted to just ask a couple of questions; one is somewhat parochial. I was visited by my local regional broadcasters just recently, and they raised a concern about regional office staffing, particularly in the New York region, some concerns about radio piracy, and I was wondering whether you have considered looking at these regional offices and the staffing levels, and the concerns that these regions have, whether you would be addressing that in this budget, and whether there is a line item specific to those regional offices?    Ms. Clarke. Yes.    Ms. Clarke. Just wondering, do you look at perhaps activities nationally, and then look at allocation of staff based on, you may have a larger problem, say, in a place like New York----    Ms. Clarke . Than you may have in other parts of the country, whether it is appropriate to shift staff according to need?    Ms. Clarke. Very well. Immediately upon taking office, Chairman Wheeler identified FCC process reform as a priority. An intra-agency staff working group produced the report on the FCC process reform. What progress has been made to implement the recommendations in that report, and could you please explain what other steps the commission has taken to improve the FCC's process?    Ms. Clarke. Very well. And as you know, FCC licenses pay the cost associated with the FCC's operations. It is, therefore, critical for the FCC to ensure that its regulatory fees are assessed in a fair and equitable fashion. Can you explain the FCC's efforts to ensure fairness in the regulatory fee structure?    Ms. Clarke. Thank you very much.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
