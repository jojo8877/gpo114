    Mr. Byrne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Gentlemen, thank you for being here today.    Admiral Harris, let me ask you some questions about the littoral combat ship program. You have stated that the littoral combat ship was a vital capability for you to engage through the PACOM area of operation. You note the LCS was needed to do missions not suited for DDGs, destroyers. How beneficial is having such a capability in your AOR to patrol waters not easily navigated by larger platforms?    Mr. Byrne. Of course, that is the plan. As you know, the last, I think, 20 ships in the 52-ship buy would be frigates that would have the up-gun and the more heavier platform. But I guess what I hear you saying is, is that because you have so many of them--and it is a cost-effective way to have so many of them--that it is another way for us to project our strength in a maritime environment, in a shallow-draft environment we find in many of those islands.    Mr. Byrne. You also mentioned how we are able to work with other nations and their navies with littoral combat ship. Could you expand on that some, please?    Mr. Byrne. Let me ask you about another vessel. It is called the joint high-speed vessel . They just renamed it the EPF . And I understand that those vessels are getting some pretty good use in PACOM. This is a well-built ship with ability to add a lot of additional capabilities. What do you see as the future of the joint high-speed vessel, the EPF, in your AOR?    Mr. Byrne. Well, thank you for your service, gentlemen, both of you.    And I yield back.    The Chairman. Mr. Johnson.
