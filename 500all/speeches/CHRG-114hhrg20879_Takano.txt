    Mr. Takano. Well, I'd like to thank the Chairman of the Energy Subcommittee for allowing me to be here today due to my specific interest in this sector, so I really appreciate that, Mr. Chairman.    I am co-Chair of the Battery Energy Storage Caucus and have a particular interest in energy storage and what we can do as policymakers to support and spur innovation in this industry.    California is making large investments in energy storage, and in my district at the University of California Riverside at the Center for Environmental Research and Technology they are working on the local--they're working with the local utility to integrate battery storage, as well as combining it with electric transportation.    We have heard from scientists and policymakers alike that there's often a false boundary between basic and applied science. To some, supporting basic research is an important role of government, while applied research should be left to the private sector. Yet this idea that there is a line that neatly divides the two separate levels of research is not realistic, and it goes against our general understanding of scientific discovery and innovation. Would you agree with this characterization, this last characterization? And I want to ask that question first and if you can briefly just address that, each one of you.    Mr. Takano. Okay. Great. Dr. Scherson?    Mr. Takano. Great. Dr. Broholm?    Mr. Takano. Yes.    Mr. Takano. Might I ask just a follow-up?    Mr. Takano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The work supported through the Basic Energy Sciences program, would you agree that it's a major example of how there is really no clear boundary between basic and applied science even if basic is in its title?    Mr. Takano. Dr. Scherson?    Mr. Takano. Fascinating. Dr. Broholm?    Mr. Takano. Dr. Hallinan?    Mr. Takano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the extra time.
