    Mr. Richmond. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I will make it short.    I have been a bunch of places on this issue, but as of late I have a quick concern, and it has probably been answered. But my question now would be how does this affect my Louisiana lottery, Mega Ball and all of those, which we as a legislature, when I was in the legislature, decided to dedicate those funds to education, to teacher pay? And for a state that is now facing a $1.6 billion budget deficit, to lose any other revenue that is helping pay for a free tuition program for college or for a teacher's education becomes a major concern. So can someone tell me how it affects the Louisiana lottery?    Mr. Richmond. Does anybody disagree with the fact that the lottery will go offline?    Mr. Richmond. So your position would be because it is online as opposed to brick and mortar?    Mr. Richmond. No. Actually, my Republican governor did a billion dollars in tax breaks with no pay-for.    Mr. Richmond. Well, let me close with this question. I didn't want to take up all the time, and it was so nice of Ms. Jackson Lee to yield. But as you go into casinos, brick-and-mortar casinos, you will see people who obviously are in there that can't afford, at least in your opinion, can't afford to lose whatever they are gambling and certainly shouldn't be sitting at the high-stakes slot.    So what becomes the difference? That they can get up and go?    Mr. Richmond. Thank you.    And thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
