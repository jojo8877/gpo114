    Ms. Tierney. Sir, it is a combination of different things.    We do have facilities such as that one that is designated as a historical facility, which, once that happens, we are not able to move forward.    And then it is a lot of political concern when we look to close a facility, so we need something like a BRAC process that would be fair, that a board would evaluate our facilities, and Congress would agree with those closures based on their ranking.    Ms. Tierney. So each case tends to be a little bit different. Sometimes that facility is on a complex, and we don't have enough construction money to tear it down.    An option when we start to do that process, one of the historical organizations gets involved--so yes, we would probably need an agreement that everybody was going to agree to close certain facilities.    Ms. Tierney. Sorry. We have a legislative request that we have submitted to give us enhanced use lease authority. Right now, our authority was limited to only supportive housing for homeless veterans. We would like to extend that back to the authority we used to have so we could bring in a broader range of people to use those beautiful historic facilities.
