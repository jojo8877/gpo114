    Mr. HANNA. Clearly, you are not in the Heifer projects. I am thinking back to Michael Milken, he was way ahead of his time, and I give him credit for that. I do not think he would be in the same jam today if he was doing what you are doing.    The information that you provide your investors with--I love what you do, I think it serves a great purpose, and I think in the marketplace it fits as long as there is transparency.    Mr. Hodges, to be frank, you may have a small loss ratio but loss ratio's are measured over time. That might be last year's, next year's could be much worse.    I am curious about the due diligence that you provide other than the obvious quality of diversity that you have, which is a big piece of it, how do you say to people what are your lower limits? Maybe this was asked, I apologize for being late. How do you inform people who are giving you large amounts of money what their true risk is?    To revisit Mr. Milken, over history, his was extremely low, not that much more than any other bond.    Mr. HANNA. What do you look for in a net worth of a guy or woman who is going to send you a check to invest?    Mr. HANNA. Which is what, $1 million?    Mr. HANNA. When you are speaking to minority groups and their ability to access what you do, not just minorities but anybody who might want to borrow money, there are lower limits to the borrower, too. You have lower limits for the investor. What are the lower limits for the borrower? How far down the food chain do you go?    Mr. HANNA. You feel pretty good about the future. With all this due diligence on your part and informing people and setting those standards for borrowers, you must have done projections on your own expectations of loss, and if your returns are X, do you subtract that?    Mr. HANNA. Do you feel you are at least 100 percent covered on the bottom side?    Mr. HANNA. That is sort of what you just said, but I appreciate where you are going. Thank you. My time has expired.
