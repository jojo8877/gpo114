    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chief Dine, really I want to echo the chairman's sentiment and add to it. Your service has been remarkable. To come into an agency that you did not grow up in, so to speak, and take command the way you did and be able to steer us through the myriad of challenges that a police agency faces every single day really reflects incredibly well on your management skills, and on the respect that your officers had for you. We were very fortunate to be able to have you lead the Capitol Police through this last 4 years.    I can tell you that I personally wish you extremely well moving forward. I enjoyed the conversations that we have had and always appreciated how you were readily available whenever we had questions and gave us really thorough and frank responses, because we don't always get those in the political process. So I just can't thank you enough for your incredible service.    Assistant Chief Verderosa, I'm looking forward to having that leadership continue. You have done a remarkable job. Now we will switch to an institutionalist, so to speak, to someone who did grow up inside the Capitol Police family, I'm looking forward to working with you and having the same kind of relationship that I have enjoyed with Chief Dine.    As we are all aware, the Capitol Police was provided with the largest budget increase of any other agency in the fiscal year 2016 omnibus; $27 million, or 8 percent above fiscal year 2015. By comparison, the House was provided with a zero percent increase, the Library of Congress, a 1.5 percent increase, and the Government Accountability Office, a 1.7 percent increase. The budget before us today requests an additional $34.6 million, or 9.2 percent, in addition to the $27 million just provided in December.    Chief Dine, Assistant Chief Verderosa, we want security, but we do not want security to the detriment of everything else that makes Congress work, including our staffs. Part of the difficulty is the inability for this committee to see a force that is adequately preparing for current global threats.    In fiscal year 2016's request, as part of your $27 million increase, a $4 million carveout was fenced off until a plan was delivered by the Capitol Police Board. Those funds were provided was to prepare for threats after the tragedies in Paris and San Bernardino. Before receiving the plan, I expected initiatives that were focused on preventing and recovering from the type of mass casualty events that we have, unfortunately, seen play out across the country and the globe.    Instead, the plan that we received was to hire more police officers and place more magnetometers. That is no different than the basic Capitol Police budget and far from the forward-thinking vision that we need to prepare for our worst-case scenarios in an ever-changing world. In addition, 1-year infusions are meant to be just that, 1 year. Hiring officers is a 30-year financial commitment that grows with inflation each and every year.    Chief Dine, as you prepare to depart, we once again need your frank assessment on how the agency is prioritizing its resources and if we are being asked to fund a 20th century police force as our threats become more 21st century every year.    Just as important as how the decisions are being made within the department to prioritize funding, I would like to understand the process by which those decisions about preparing our force for how forward looking approaches are made. If we are having outside forces come in and make decisions for you, that is something that I would like to hear about during this hearing, and you should expect a healthy exchange from me during questioning.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to their testimony.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you very much.    Chief, in my opening statement, I made mention of being surprised an additional $4 million was provided in the omnibus. Those funds were fenced off specifically to fund approaches to keep us safe in the wake of mass casualty attacks in places like San Bernadino and Paris, and require committee approval before they are used. But, again, as I mentioned, those funds are now simply going towards more officers and more magnetometers, 48 actually, and those funds are going to be used to hire, train, and equip those 48 sworn officers.    Since the plan came up after your fiscal year 2017 request, does your budget need to be adjusted to pay for those officers? And much has been made by many Members about the need for us to return to regular order in both the appropriations process and the process that we are using to move legislation, and that, to me, is not representative of regular order by any means, especially when we are obligating a lot of money through the balance of an officer's career. It is not 1-year money.    So if you could touch on that. Additionally, I want to ask you, as I asked you when we first had a chance to talk at one of these hearings, about the Capitol Police Board. Because, if you will recall, I asked your opinion of the Capitol Police Board and its structure, and you had only been on the job a couple of months and had good things to say, including positive reviews to the Board, and the direction that they provided.    So three years later, as you are departing this institution, I would like that same assessment. How has the governance structure of the Board worked? Has it allowed the Chief to function in a way that enables reasonable planning, allows the Chief to address appropriate security needs, and be held accountable for those decisions?    Specifically in the fiscal year 2017 request, how much of the Capitol Police budget would you estimate is due to direction from the Board or the Sergeant versus what your department has prioritized?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I told you it would be challenging.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Have we faced a credible threat similar to San Bernardino or any other----    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. How much of your request is due to your prioritization as the leader of the police force and your fellow officers and direction from the Capitol Police Board or the Sergeant?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. What is the readiness state of the police? we have given you upwards of 8 to 10 percent increases with flatlining the other agencies. How many officers is the ideal number? We all want to be safe, and we want to keep the visitors that join us here safe, but it does seem that there is never an ideal number.    I remember, Mr. Chairman, when I was the chair of this subcommittee, and it is a question that I still ask any agency head to respond to: there are the ``got to haves'' and the ``nice to haves.''    I have seen many, many bells and whistles that are available to the Capitol Police, and I could see the value in each and every one of those. But when we have just come through a recession and there are real needs for the rest this bill, we need to make sure that we are funding those real needs and not the bells and whistles that could maybe wait so that we can fund the overall needs of an agency that is an entire branch of our Government.    I know that is not your job to prioritize, but it is a question that is in need of an answer because it is hard to know when you are ready.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. A brilliant question. Thank you very much.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Are you in a posture where you will just ask for whatever we will give you and you will take whatever we will give you because you could always put it to good use?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Or are you actually crafting a budget that is representative of what your actual needs are to be able to make sure that we can cover the Capitol complex and its security needs?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. I have other questions, but I will reserve them.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. My work here is done, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you very much.    Chief, I want to just go more specifically into the issue of the House garages and the security screenings that are in the process of being implemented, or at least getting ready to be implemented.    Why has a proposed security in the House garages suddenly gone through an implementation process that did not go through the normal appropriations process, was never discussed by any elected Member of Congress, hasn't gone through regular order, or allowed us to prioritize how much that would cost compared to competing needs? I'm concerned this new proposal is causing shifts of officers and causing what I would view as a shoddy, disorderly process. This process ultimately will likely not result in our being able to make sure that the security goals are achieved. We should rather be going through an orderly process that allows for people who were elected to make funding decisions, and who were selected for this committee to do that; to do our jobs.    So I have several questions in that category. Will the screening of staff at garages mean that the screening of staff and visitors at the Cannon and Rayburn tunnels are going to be eliminated? For example, the Senate screens all the staff, so they have closed out the screening in other places because they have one sort of central point. I know they screen a lot less people than we do.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. OK. I thought that would be your answer. We are only in the process of trying to do this in Longworth. So, how are you going to achieve that if we are not doing the same in Rayburn, which has, perhaps 80 doors inside the garage? Let me preface this by saying I am absolutely 100 percent behind necessary security measures. I mean, we absolutely should have these in place. But we have a process that exists for us to follow as appropriators, and it has not been followed.    Now you have to come up with how many officers you are having to shift midstream that you haven't planned for. Are you going to leave them wherever they were uncovered, or have those slots covered by something else or someone else?    Why would we partially implement a garage security project? It seems to me like you should do it all or you don't do any of it until you can do all of it. What is the total startup cost to fully implement garage security? How much is it going to cost us in staffing each year after it is up and running? Because it is not just a cost now. That is the first one, for starters.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. But what is the urgency? I mean, do we have--you mentioned earlier we don't have a credible threat. Of course, anything could happen at any time and you always have to be ready. But we are 15 years past 9/11, and we have been functioning, and it has been a concern the whole time, but we have been functioning without that security at the garages. What is the ``all-fire emergency'' that it has to be done outside the appropriations process, outside regular order? And essentially, where did this order, where did this come from?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I just met with the House Sergeant at Arms in my office, and without discussing our conversation, that is not my understanding. Where did this come from?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I know you are just doing your job and you have to follow the direction that you are given.    But I would like someone, Mr. Chairman--I realize you are the acting chairman for the moment--but I absolutely would like an explanation as to why we have gone outside regular order. No one on the Capitol Police Board is elected to anything. And we have an Appropriations Committee for a reason, and we are the ones that spend time, over many years, prioritizing what our needs are.    Perhaps we would decide that this is an urgent need that has to be done immediately. Then we could prioritize where we shift funds, and decide what is going to be at the top of the priority list and what we reduce down lower, if this is an all-fire emergency. But it has not been an all-fire emergency for 15 years, so I don't know how it is now.    I need a more specific explanation, which I am happy to further explore with the Sergeant when he is here tomorrow.    Mr. Chairman, this is no way to run a rodeo, and this might prove to be a need that is more urgent than it has been up to now. However, that is our responsibility as appropriators to make that decision, not for it to be imposed upon us and dropped in, in the middle of what we all committed to and that I heard the leadership pledge fealty to when the current Speaker took his office, which is to return to regular order.    And this is anything but that, and it is a very significant amount of money, millions upon millions of dollars committed many years in the future. I mean, I think you have asked for something like 57 officers to cover this, and they serve until they are 57. That is 57 officers who will serve until 57. That is a very large commitment to never actually have gone through the planning process that we have here.    So, Mr. Chairman, I would like you, if you could relay to Chairman Graves that I would like to have my questions submitted for the record, and whoever is responsible for beginning the process of the House garage security project outside of the Appropriations Committee should be asked and required to answer our questions.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. My questions.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Mr. Amodei, are you suggesting that we come back together so that we can have that conversation? We can even do it in closed session.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Right. I think that would be extremely helpful.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    And welcome back to the committee, Mr. Ayers. It is always a pleasure to work with you, and I enjoyed the opportunity to briefly review your budget request, which is $694.3 million and 13.3 percent above the enacted.    I am pleased to see that the budget includes some funds for the Historic Buildings Trust Fund, and I appreciate the chairman keeping the Historic Buildings Trust Fund alive last year while separately funding the Cannon project. Funding Cannon's restoration as its own line item was the right thing to do, really important for us to use the Historic Preservation Trust Fund to bank resources for future restoration and renewal. We have got hundreds of millions of dollars in front of us, and so one of the things I am concerned about, as I mentioned to you, is, while our oversight is important and we want to make sure that we can have as much transparency as possible--that is why the separation was important--this year's budget request for the Historic Buildings Trust Fund is only $10 million. I am concerned that we are not banking enough funds to save for future large-scale projects. Cannon is $800 million by itself, and we know Longworth and Rayburn will be even more.    So, in 10 years, if we keep going at this rate, we would only save $100 million for future projects. The Cannon House Building alone, as I said, will cost close to $800 million. I am certain the next building to need major renovations won't be any less. So saving $10 million a year for the next big project is not enough, in my opinion. And I would ask my colleagues to consider that as we go through the process of crafting this budget.    As we consider a budget that reflects our interests, our values and our needs, we have to start with responsible planning within our own walls.    In addition to the Cannon project, the Architect is in the home stretch of restoring the Capitol dome. Congratulations on that. This subcommittee funded the $126 million needed to restore the dome and the rotunda to its former glory. I am looking forward to seeing it before the inauguration next year, and that project is the most visible example around the world of our roles as stewards of these great institutions that make up Congress.    And I look forward to your testimony.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you very much.    Mr. Ayers, I have a few questions.    I will try to flip through them, but you might want to bounce back and forth to other members, Mr. Chairman.    I wanted to ask you about the page dorm because if you remember, in fiscal year 2014, I included language in our bill to make sure the committee is notified before any work is done to the page dorm or there is any discussion or proposal to use it for a different purpose. Has there been any work done to the building since the page program was eliminated, and have there been any discussions about the future of that building that you are aware of?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Are there specific future uses? Have they been specific?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. And what are those?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. OK. So the language in the fiscal year 2014 bill directed you to make sure that you made the committee aware before you made any changes. So I would very much appreciate if we make sure that those discussions don't go any further without including the subcommittee in those discussions.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. There is nothing wrong with child care, but the purpose of it was to make sure that we could make a decision, as I keep raising, that is ours to make when it comes to prioritizing how funds are spent and the appropriate use for the facilities that are on the Capitol, that are in the Capitol complex.    Also, just to give Members something to chew on, while that is an interesting proposal--and as a mother of young children, I certainly understand the need for expanded childcare opportunities. But any decision that we make that permanently alters the ability for us to maintain that building as a dorm, as a dormitory, forever precludes us from reinstituting the page program if future House leadership ever chooses to do that.    I, for one, lament that we do not have a House page program any longer. There are generations of young people who were inspired by their participation in that program to engage in public service. I remain convinced that we could go back and try to reform that program and make sure that if it were reinstituted, we could keep young people engaged.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Yes, they do. They do, and they have their own dorm. Ours is closed.    OK. The Rayburn firing range, as you know, is closed. It is a brand-new firing range that the AOC was responsible for managing the construction. How long was it open before the problems of ricocheting bullets were identified, and what is the timeline for reopening it? What happened with the contractor that the design of the firing range resulted in ricocheting bullets? I mean, it is sort of baffling how this could occur.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. What is the timetable for determining why this happened and what the cause was and/or reopening the range?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Are there any additional costs that we are going to be incurring as a result of the process that they have to go through now?    Mr. Ayers.My best guess is, perhaps 2 months as we work through possible causes. There are 15 issues on the table. Three or four are closed out already, and as we work through all of those, it is going to take a little time to do that.    We don't know whether there is a design problem which would result in us having to reconstruct something, so we don't know when the range will reopen or if there will be a future expense. There are, I think, expenses that we are incurring today and Capitol Police are incurring today. For example, bringing in a third-party consultant to help us understand whether there is a design issue or not. The police bringing in a team to help them write their operation and maintenance procedures, the cleaning procedures, and the procedures for effectively using this range will cost a small amount of money out of their budget.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Is there a provision in the contracts that you had with the vendors that designed it, or built it for reimbursement of costs incurred from design flaws or errors that are determined ultimately to be the fault of the contractor, rather than the fault of the Architect of the Capitol's personnel?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. How much would you say you plan to spend to address the problems thus far, and what do you anticipate it costing going forward?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. But, potentially, we could have to have a reconstruction or a redesign that could cost far more than that?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. And the range remains closed. Was anyone hurt during the use of the range from the ricocheting bullets?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I mentioned in my testimony the Capitol dome project being in the home stretch, and I wanted to ask you whether you expect that it is going to come in at the full $126 million expenditure, or do you anticipate there being any funds that will remain at the end of the project that could possibly be used for other projects.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. About how much, do you think?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. If you could let us know, that would be helpful.    When the scaffolding is removed, what will people notice? What is the biggest differences that people will notice about the dome, the most visible change after the restoration?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Mr. Chairman, just one more question, and then I will just be done instead of coming back to me, if you don't mind.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. We talked about the working capital fund in my office earlier, but can you explain what the Architect's personnel believe is wrong with the way that we fund your construction division through separate appropriations that we provide? And can you address the real issue of reduced oversight on our part if we allow you to move some of those separate appropriations to a working capital fund?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Well, it would be important if we allow that shift to make sure that we put a mechanism in place that ensures that we can maintain the same oversight we have been able to under the current way you do it.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back and thank you for your indulgence.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Well, the Library is planning on piggybacking on this as well.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, if I might. My understanding is that it is in their budget request, and also, in last year's bill, we put language that allowed them to review, and study piggybacking onto this data center.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I just met with the acting Librarian, and he expressed a strong desire for it to happen, and they need it.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. He didn't suggest to me--you should check with them, Mr. Chairman--but he didn't suggest to me that there was a challenge.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. From the House?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Yes, the information that I got a few hours ago from the acting Librarian is that they are working with House Administration, the Chief Administrative Officer in the House, and----    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. They will be with us tomorrow, so we can ask them then.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. That is what you do when you are in the know about what is coming.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    I join the chairman in welcoming our witnesses.    Mr. Plaster, welcome to your first hearing in Appropriations. I know you are new to the job and that you are acting in a so-called interim capacity. But you have been of service to the House of Representatives for many years. We are looking forward to working with you and looking forward to your insights.    The budget before us, unfortunately, provides no increases for the Members' Representational Allowance, our office budgets, committees, or leadership offices, with some increases for the officers of the House and for hearing room renovations.    Mr. Chairman, I consider the House, as you know, the staff, operations, and its buildings, our primary ward. We are responsible. As unsexy as our portion of the budget for the United States of America is, it is a critical component because we are helping to make sure that the greatest democracy the world has ever known is able to function.    It is in both parties' interest to ensure that the House functions at the highest levels so that we can attract and retain the best and brightest talent. We have heard countless discussions here where we lose to other agencies because we continue to be less and less competitive when it comes to the salaries that we pay, the benefits that we provide, and our ability to make sure that we can provide the best and brightest with enough attraction and reason to come and work for us instead of other competing potential opportunities.    We have to leave this institution better than we found it, and that is our challenge and our responsibility as members of this subcommittee. I don't believe that we will accomplish such a laudable goal by providing the Capitol Police, for example, with an 8 percent budget increase while providing the House with a zero percent increase, which we did in the Omnibus that we just passed in December 2015. We cannot carry out our constitutional duties with those types of priorities.    Assuming that our allocation remains the same in fiscal year 2017, I certainly hope that we can realign our priorities.    I know I might be starting to sound like a broken record. I don't mind that. I am going to continue to advocate for our staff and for the institution.    If you recall last year, Mr. Chairman, I reported that in 2013, legislative assistants who work for the House of Representatives were being paid $6,000 less than they were in 2009, when adjusted for inflation. And just in case we forgot how difficult it is to survive when you are just starting out in your career, I will point out that a median-priced one bedroom apartment in the DC area costs $2,000 a month. After paying for rent and eating in the House cafeterias, we are lucky that we can keep anyone on staff.    Now, let me highlight something in the Fiscal Year 2016 Omnibus that we were able to accomplish. With the help of the Clerk of the House, the committee funded $7 million in the Financial Services bill to increase the capacity of the National Archives and Records Administration to store archives of the House and Senate. The National Archives and Records Administration, which is funded in the Financial Services bill, is running out of space to store Legislative Branch archives. So that is not in our bill. NARA is, though, of great benefit to future Congresses, to historians and researchers, who will use this information to judge us when we are long gone.    That was phase one, and I hope we can impress upon our colleagues on that subcommittee to keep this project going. And I would recommend to any member who has not been over to the Archives and been in the Legislative Vault, it is a sight to behold. And, you have an opportunity to have that.    Mr. Chairman, you may even want to bring us on a field trip, as you have been wont to do, to the Archives, because the things that we will have an opportunity to see will, I think, motivate all members of this subcommittee to impress upon our Financial Services colleagues how important that is.    But before I conclude, Mr. Chairman, I do want to voice my frustration at how our committee continues to be circumvented outside of the regular order, which I know is a top priority of Speaker Ryan.. Decisions about funding are being decided in ways that cannot be brought to light through congressional oversight because they are being made outside of our ability to oversee them.    We have spent from Federal appropriations more than $6 million combined on the Benghazi Select Committee and on the Energy and Commerce Committee for the Select Investigative Committee on Planned Parenthood. The House budget presented to us to consider does not reflect the increased budget requirements for these partisan lawsuits, the Benghazi Committee, or the additional needs for the Planned Parenthood panel under Energy and Commerce.    To add insult to injury, the Benghazi Committee, unlike every other committee of the House, and a committee that has existed for years now, does not receive its own appropriation and does not even receive funds through the Committee Funding Resolution that is voted on by the whole House. In other words, we have unelected people deciding how much money that committee gets.    To add insult to injury, unlike every other committee of the House, it does not receive its own appropriation and it does not receive funds through our Committee Funding Resolution.    We may never agree whether these activities are worthwhile, but for the sake of regular order, a refrain I have heard is being important to your side of the aisle over and over and over again, we must insist that these items be funded through the regular appropriations process and authorization processes. Not only do we not have oversight of how millions are being siphoned for political games, but this is threatening Congress' real work.    These new political committees and panels come at the expense of our standing committees that have enacted very little authorizing legislation on important issues of our day. We can only surmise that if we funded those committees for their real policy work, that this Congress could actually begin working for the American people again and pass--shudder the thought--bipartisan legislation.    Mr. Chairman, if for no other reason than for transparency for the American people, this subcommittee should insist on regular order and require the justifications to provide budget details on these committees and on the partisan lawsuits that we have, unfortunately, been funding at every turn. We know that they can provide that. They have gone on long enough.    I have heard the General Counsel answer questions of mine, Mr. Chairman, in the past, where he said, we just don't know what the costs might ultimately be. Well, neither does the Department of Justice. But they are required to provide us with a budget justification and anticipate what their needs are, even when it comes to the uncertainty of their lawsuits.    So within our limited scope, I look forward to hearing the testimony of the witnesses that are here today, and I yield back.                     House Officers Opening Remarks    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you very much.    Sergeant, I would like to start with you. Good afternoon. I have asked you and the Chief over the years about the appropriate layout and management structure for the Capitol Police Board, on which you sit.    For others that are not aware, the Chief, as I mentioned yesterday, is not a full member of the Capitol Police Board. He or she is only an ex officio member. And that setup really cripples our ability to conduct oversight. We can't question the Senate Sergeant. The Senate can't question our Sergeant. So the Chief is left to answer for decisions that, frankly, were set in motion by the Board, yet we don't have consistent oversight over those decisions because we can't ask everyone making them questions about them.    Now, I know the Senate appropriators and the authorizers have asked GAO to update a review of the Capitol Police Board, and that is ongoing. I support that.    But I would like to ask you, does the Board in its current iteration and management structure remain useful? Should there be changes to the way it makes decisions and its oversight responsibilities? And how would you address my concern that Congress really doesn't have enough ability to conduct oversight over the Board's decisions? Because we can't do that with the entire Board.    I have other questions. For example, like, how much of the Capitol Police budget would you estimate is due to the directions from the Board or from the Sergeant versus what the Capitol Police believes are priorities? And then I want to ask you also about the garage security initiative.    So if you could address the management structure first with the Board's role?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Let me give you an example of what I am talking about.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I appreciate that the Sergeants each go to one another when there is concern from the other side. But we have had conversations outside of this setting when you and the Senate Sergeant disagreed on the appropriate response to a security concern.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. They made a different decision than you chose to when it came to an evacuation issue.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Right, that lockdown issue.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. So if that was something that this subcommittee chose to review, I could only talk to you about it, to the Chief, and maybe the Architect of the Capitol, who, by the way, also sits on the Police Board, which most people don't realize. I don't have the ability, if there was a difference of opinion, to hold the Senate Sergeant accountable.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. So this subcommittee is going to be meeting with the Capitol Police Board along with the House Administration?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. My specific question is, do you think there needs to be reform to the way the Capitol Police Board functions and makes decisions in order for us to ensure that we don't have to rely on you being willing to sit down with us in a meeting?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I look forward to the GAO recommendations, but I remain concerned.    I want to ask you about the garage security initiative.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. The Chief was clear yesterday in my questions of him that he was directed to initiate the garage security project by you as the Sergeant at Arms and by the Board, and you as a Board member. He did not deny that it is a vulnerability that we are only doing it in one part of the garage. And he was not able to explain why we needed to bypass the appropriations process, as we were able to previously put it through prior to this year.    My question is, Mr. Irving, why wasn't this project justified and explained as part of the budget justifications in previous years? Why did funding need to be added and moved around during the year after we held hearings and allowed all Members to vote on the Legislative Branch appropriations bill in the House?    The Chief was clear that the direction to do this project in what I see as a potentially shoddy and haphazard manner, was outside of the regular order. Again, the strength of our security is reliant upon its weakest link. We are not securing all the garages. So if I am a terrorist, I am going to go to the garage that is not secure.    Can you explain why this had to be done outside of the regular order? The Chief, in answer to my question, said there were no specific credible threats that were pending or that we were concerned about. So what pressure did you have to do this project without full funding and in the middle of the appropriations process?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Elsewhere in the country.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Who is ``we''?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. So the Capitol Police Board on its own initiated a mid-appropriations cycle addition to this project without any credible threat or indication that there was anything that required us to move outside the appropriations process even though that is how we were proceeding prior to this fiscal year?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I know you take responsibility. I am asking if it was your and the Capitol Police Board's initiative to take this initiative outside the appropriations process even though there is no credible threat, there is no emergency, and we were proceeding in an orderly way?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Did you feel that you were not going to be able to accomplish what you needed to by going through regular order in the appropriations process that we are in the middle of right now, which is a matter of a couple of weeks' difference?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Sergeant who directed you to initiate this project in this way?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I know you take responsibility. That is not my question.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Only a Board decision? No one else was involved?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Who directed you to initiate this project outside of regular order?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. So you initiated it on your own because in your analysis you decided, without any outside influence or pressure, that this was necessary and so essential that we remove it from the regular order process.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Did you decide this on your own, of your own initiative, with no outside pressure or direction?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. So no one else but House Administration and you?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Did the direction come from the leadership?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Was this brought to you?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Mr. Chairman, I am getting extremely frustrated. I don't think I am getting veracity in the responses to my question.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I understand that. That is not my question. I will have other questions for the other remaining officers, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. They also have the responsibility to be truthful when they are asked questions.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. OK.                          Remarks--Mr. Palazzo    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. In an open hearing?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Mr. Chairman, I did have other questions for the remaining officers. And I would think there would be more questions for this group than there is going to be for the Library and for the Copyright Office.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Just a guess.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I would just request, respectfully, that if we could lengthen this meeting, because I don't think the next meeting is going to be quite as long.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Even though I am asking the most questions, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I will do the best I can. But we have an abbreviated hearing schedule, so we are having to cram a lot in, in just a few minutes.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. As would I.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have two questions for the CAO. So I would ask your indulgence in asking both of them.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. They are completely different questions, but I am happy to ask them together. And I can assure you that the CAO knows they are coming.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Briefly, last year Mr. Kircher and I went round and round over his inability to budget for the partisan lawsuits that appear to be cropping up against the administration over the Affordable Care Act. Guantanamo Bay now is being prepared, as is Planned Parenthood and the Planned Parenthood Select Committee. We recently learned that Mr. Kircher has hired another law firm to eventually enter into legal action against the Obama administration to prevent their efforts at Guantanamo Bay.    We might disagree on the merits of the cases, Mr. Chairman, that is not my issue. But again, you can sense the running thread through everything I have asked in our last two hearings is that we are doing things that we absolutely could anticipate and have the right to exercise oversight for here outside of the regular order process. As a result, unelected--no disrespect to Mr. Kircher, but he was never elected to anything, and neither was the CAO--unelcted people are making these decisions. So the decisions about millions upon millions of dollars made outside our regular order process aren't responsible.    There is no agency that knows exactly what litigation they are going to enter into, but there is a possibility of, as the Department of Justice does, anticipating what their needs are going to be. But we are doing a disservice to the House if we continue to fund lawsuits through reprogrammings, because those are not public documents, no one sees that. And I know, Mr. Chairman, you are committed to regular order, and so many of your members are.    So since we don't get an estimate of the lawsuits, I do want to enter this article into the record, if I might, because we do need to know what the House majority has spent thus far on taking this administration to court.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I would like Mr. Plaster to give us an estimate of the total cost that has been reprogrammed from other House offices since 2011 until now to the Office of the General Counsel. And I would like Mr. Kircher to provide details of his budget, including how much has been spent or budgeted for each litigation that he has entered into from 2011 until now. If they can get me that information outside the meeting, I would appreciate it, because it is important.     Mr. Plaster, the other question I have is regarding Sodexo, the new vendor that has taken over the cafeterias, as well as our convenience store and dining room. I don't have to tell you that there has been an explosion of complaints about both the quality of the food and the cost of the food. Again, we have hard-working young people here who are not earning very much money, and it costing them an arm and a leg to eat is really unfair. I mean, when you have The New York Times write an article about how bad and expensive the food is in the House cafeteria, you know you have a problem.    So I would like you to answer, when the contract is up for review? We are putting up a lot of money for infrastructure to redesign the House cafeteria, and I want to make sure they succeed. But what are we going to do to turn this problem around in the confines of the contract?    The other thing I want to raise here is the Longworth convenience store. We seem to have forgotten that there are women who work in the Capitol complex. It has come to my attention that the convenience store has stopped stocking feminine hygiene products. I know that some might be concerned about my going there. But if you are not a woman, it is tough to understand that when you need a feminine hygiene product you need one immediately. So for the convenience store to stop stocking products like that is really inconvenient, the opposite of the purpose of a convenience store.    The other thing, which I know may have more to do with the Architect, but if you could take it as your responsibility to communicate with the Architect, every woman has faced the frustration, whether it is a staff person, a visitor, a Member, of going into one of the women's bathrooms anywhere in the Capitol complex and finding a completely broken feminine hygiene products machine. I had my staff text me today a machine that has an out of order sign on it, and I will show it to you. It is right here. Out of order. Just today.    These are essential items that are just as essential as toilet paper is, and it is absolutely a necessity to remedy this situation. I would like to ask you what we can do about making sure that the convenience store is stocked fully with the range of feminine hygiene products that women need, and also to make sure that we have functioning machines--which, quite frankly--my colleague, Grace Meng has raised this as well--should be free. It is like charging for toilet paper. And we certainly wouldn't want to do that. So if you could respond to that concern.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. He is ready.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. And we have the ability to terminate their contract for cause?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you. I mean, not to go into too much detail, but I saw what was added to the inventory in the convenience store today, and that is insufficient.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. So if we could expand the availability, that would be great.    And, Sergeant, the meeting you referenced is a staff meeting, it is not a meeting with Members. So that is not the same thing. Related to the Capitol Police Board and House Administration, that is a staff-level meeting.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    If I can ask Dr. Mazanec to come to the table, please.    Thank you very much. Thank you for the work that you do to--and all of the folks that work at CRS--to support Members of Congress who really need the information that you provide to be able to represent our constituents effectively.    Your request is $114.4 million. That is a 7 percent increase over last year, which I don't find excessive, given the reference I made to how flat your funding has been. Not only flat, it has been concave over the last 4 years. You are currently funded, as I mentioned, at $5.6 million less than in your fiscal year 2010 level.    Can you outline for us, one, if the subcommittee continues to deny your budget request increases, what are the consequences? What is the impact? Second, what has been the effect of absorbing inflationary increases and mandatory pay increases with additional appropriations as you have gone through that process?    I have another series of questions for you as well.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you.    And that is my concern as well, is we need CRS to be responsive. I know when I have asked for CRS reports, Mr. Chairman, you want to know what you want to know when you want to know it, and it often is time sensitive. And so this constant flat funding or even reduced funding will continue to cause us problems.    Dr. Mazanec, I am anticipating that we are going to have another debate about the release and public posting of your reports.    And, Mr. Newlen, I would like to also ask your opinion on this since you were there at CRS for a very long time.    My concern with basically making CRS like GAO, where you post your reports on a Web site, is that it would basically bring all the work that you are doing to a screeching halt. I mean, GAO, we have great respect for the work that they do. They have a completely different function. They provide comprehensive analysis on complex topics. They make recommendations to Congress.    And what they are not billed to do though is act quickly and responsibly and privately. And my concern is that CRS, if you have a new interface that is public, in other words, your interface is with the public not with Congress, that we are going to create another GAO.    So could you share with the subcommittee your insights, both of your insights, on CRS' culture and how any change to those policies related to releasing reports could change that culture. And I know supporters of releasing reports to the public on the CRS Web site point to language in the appropriations bills as the reasons that reports are not listed. So if this language was removed, would that then allow CRS to release their reports?    And lastly, so I am mindful of the time, is there a middle ground on this issue that we could release certain informational reports through the House Clerk and the Secretary of the Senate so that the House itself is controlling what gets released as opposed to turning you into an agency that basically directly serves the public instead of serving as a service for the Congress?    Because there are times when, as I have said before, Mr. Chairman, you and I might have an idea that we may never decide to explore. But if we change the way CRS works and suddenly everything, every idea we ever explore is immediately posted on a Web site, then a lot of things that you begin to explore as a Member of Congress, as a legislator with the speech and debate clause being in the Constitution, wouldn't be ripe or ready or even appropriate at the incubator stage of preparation.    So I just would love to have both of your thoughts.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Seems to me that that, Mr. Chairman, is a way that we could provide transparency. I am from the Sunshine State. That is not being funny--we have the most stringent sunshine law in the country. So I am from that culture.    But I also know that there are things that we all do as legislators that are the dumbest ideas on the face of the Earth, and when you consult an expert at CRS, they help shut you down right away. You may not want to expose that dumb idea or it is not the direction that you ultimately choose to go.    So there are unintended consequences. There are fully baked reports that we could share. I just think to protect the speech and debate requirements that we have here, that that is something that should be initiated and controlled by the House of Representatives and the Senate rather than it forced on the people who are providing a service to us to be able to do our jobs effectively.    So thank you. I yield back.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Let's get them more money, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. And have the opportunity for people to see it.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. We received it early, which was nice and refreshing. But I am concerned that you built a budget request that doesn't probably line up with your report.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. How are we going to reconcile that we have to build a budget but not ignore the report until we build the next budget. I will just ask my questions all at once and expedite this.    The other fiscal year 2016 requirement was that your office was to go out and ask stakeholders for their opinion of how we fund the Copyright Office and take their temperature in terms of their willingness to pay to improve IT infrastructure. I am guessing that there is probably willingness out there.    I don't want to prejudge what we are likely to hear from the public when you go through the comment period, but I would like you to prejudge what we are likely hear from, large versus small copyright owners. Also, if you could just give a brief explanation of what we are allowed to pay for through fees versus appropriations at the moment.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. To large copyright holders.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. A little more whiz, bang.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. They are not plowed back into the service right now?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. you are building, it looks like, an independent IT system, but you are still housed within the Library?    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. You did. Thank you.
