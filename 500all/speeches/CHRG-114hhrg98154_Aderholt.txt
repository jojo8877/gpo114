    Mr. Aderholt. Well, good morning. The Subcommittee will come to order.    I know Mr. Farr will be here shortly. And, hopefully, by the time we get to the end of my opening statement, he'll have a chance to make his remarks as we are on schedule. But we do want to get started. I will go ahead and make my opening remarks.    I just wanted to welcome each of you here this morning, and thank you for being here.    As I mentioned before, the Subcommittee is focusing on the themes of management, targeting, and promotion this year. We want to ensure that research funds are targeted the most important programs and problems and that, through research, we are promoting a productive agricultural sector and a safe food supply. We are reviewing the requests with these in mind as we go through the USDA's fiscal year 2016 budget request for research agencies.    I would like to welcome our panel this morning.    First of all, Dr. Cathy Woteki, Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics and Chief Scientist for the U.S. Department of Ag, to the Subcommittee.    So welcome, Dr. Woteki, for being here.    Also, we are equally happy to have Dr. Chavonda Jacobs-Young, Administrator of the Agricultural Research Service.    Glad to have you here.    Welcome back, Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy, Director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.    Dr. Mary Bohman, Administrator for the Economic Research Service.    Welcome. Good to have you here.    Mr. Joe Reilly, Administrator of the National Agricultural Statistics Service.    Welcome. Good to have you here.    And welcome back again, Mr. Mike Young, Director of the Office of Budget and Program Analysis.    On behalf of the Subcommittee, I would like to thank all of you and your staff for your hard work on agricultural research. You are the scientists. You are the professionals. You are the leaders that look at sort of the scientific questions that we have regarding agriculture.                    Opening Statement--Mr. Aderholt    USDA is proposing a $467-million increase over the fiscal year 2015 enacted levels for its research programs. This includes significant research increases of $206 million for ARS buildings and facilities, $125 million for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, $80 million to create two new innovation institutes, and $20 million for a new competitive grant program for land-grant colleges and universities. There is a myriad of other increases, decreases, closures, and transfers to the request as well.    This hearing will allow the Subcommittee to thoroughly examine these and help us determine whether USDA is effectively administering its programs and meeting the Nation's needs as it comes to agricultural research.    Given the sizable increase proposed by the budget request, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that we are operating in a very constrained funding environment, which we usually are, but this year as much as ever.    We are bound by the spending caps under the existing law. And, of course, we will do our best to address the highest priorities and needs as we see best. But any increases most likely will have to be offset against other accounts and other programs that are in the bill.    Before I close, I want to alert the Subcommittee that Mr. Farr and I are going to begin the question-and-answer period with a discussion on the New York Times article regarding the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, which is referred to as MARC, in Clay Center, Nebraska.    Given the seriousness of the allegations, our questions may take a few more minutes than usual. There are a number of important issues that we need to discuss and clarify for the record. So I ask for your patience on that.    Mr. Aderholt. So at this point let me ask our Ranking Member, Mr. Farr, if he has any opening remarks.                       Opening Remarks--Mr. Farr    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you, Mr. Farr.    Dr. Woteki, we will now turn to you for your opening statement. Of course, your full statement will be included in the record. But we will ask you now to proceed with that, and then we will go forward with questions.                     Opening Statement--Dr. Woteki    Mr. Aderholt. Well, thank you for your testimony.    Mr. Aderholt. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we want to start with the New York Times article about MARC in Clay Center, Nebraska.    I have had a chance to see the article, to read it, to reread, to highlight, to look at different aspects of it. It is a difficult read in many ways because you are talking about living beings. I know that I have to step back and recognize the value of animal research.    The article raised some serious questions. And, as Chairman of the Subcommittee overseeing the agency, you know, they are concerning. And that should go without saying.    I understand that, when researchers mimic real-life situations, some animals may die unintentionally and even unexpectedly. But let me state and be very clear that we expect all animals to be treated humanely and that no type of abuse or mistreatment would be tolerated. Further, we expect the risk of premature death to be limited whenever possible.    I believe ARS holds all of its animal research to a very high standard, especially in the care and handling of its animals. As such, the allegations in this article seem to be inconsistent with what I know of USDA's research in the past. Regardless, we have a number of questions about the article and the review Secretary Vilsack ordered, as well as the Department's next steps as we want to inquire about.    Dr. Woteki and Dr. Jacobs-Young, we ask you to keep your answers brief when we ask this so that we can get through a number of questions so that we can have time to go through the extensive list.    But I guess my first question would be: Were the animals abused or mistreated at MARC?    Mr. Aderholt. Have you investigated the specific instance of the animal abuse that is mentioned in the article?    Mr. Aderholt. Well, the Department began receiving questions from the New York Times more than a year ago, back in--if my notes are right--February of 2014. And as far as we know, the Department didn't take any action until the article was published in January of 2015.    So the question is: Why did the Department wait so long to look into animal care and what happened there at MARC?    Mr. Aderholt. At what point did that occur?    Mr. Aderholt. So you are saying before January of 2015 you started looking into that?    Mr. Aderholt. Well, why did the Department wait to appoint an ombudsman for the animal welfare, wait so long about that?    Mr. Aderholt. What role does the Department play when an agency such as ARS receives a large information request from some kind of news service?    Mr. Aderholt. Is the Department conducting a review of its management of this issue?    Mr. Aderholt. Based on what you know, do you think changes need to be made so there will be more transparency in the future?    Mr. Aderholt. What are the next steps for the Animal Care and Wellbeing Committee?    Mr. Aderholt. Well, as you know, Representative Farr and I had asked the Inspector General to review the allegations made in the article.    How are ARS and the Department working with the Inspector General's Office on this?    Mr. Aderholt. Well, you know, certainly we expect you to cooperate with the Inspector General's review and to respond to recommendations that they may make.    And so I just want to, you know, ask you, are you committed to doing that?    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you.    Mr. Farr.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Yoder.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Bishop.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Young.    Mr. Aderholt. You don't have any left.    Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Rooney.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Valadao.    Mr. Aderholt. Ms. DeLauro.    Mr. Aderholt. Sure.    Mr. Aderholt. Dr. Harris.    Mr. Aderholt. What is your question?    Mr. Aderholt. We will go into a second round.    Mr. Aderholt. Let me go back.    We could probably spend the whole morning on the New York Times article. But, just lastly, I wanted to close with this: Congressman Farr had asked a question about the response from USDA from the Subcommittee's questions that we sent over, and I don't think you really answered the question as to why USDA didn't answer the question.    Could you let me know? Because we got the response back, and it is basically just a recap of the New York Times article, and just a response to that. So we had asked some very specific questions on that and just want an answer to why you didn't answer the question that was posed to you.    Mr. Aderholt. So your attorneys advised you not to answer the questions that we had sent directly?    Mr. Aderholt. Let me move on to the sheep experiment station.    ARS brought a request proposal to close the sheep experiment station in Idaho. Funding would be transferred from the closed facility to three other ARS labs in the State.    Last year the Committee denied the agency's reprogramming request to close that facility. And then last year the sheep industry and related research community came together to develop a plan to refocus the sheep experiment station.    Did ARS take this plan into account when it developed the fiscal year 2016 budget request?    Mr. Aderholt. I am sorry. It is not what?    Mr. Aderholt. So you say you have not actually had a chance to see the plan?    Mr. Aderholt. So you don't have an opinion on the plan at this point?    Mr. Aderholt. So did ARS participate in the development of it?    Mr. Aderholt. Why is the ARS requiring the station to cover the litigation costs related to its grazing leases?    Mr. Aderholt. Does ARS require other labs to cover litigation costs related to their research?    Mr. Aderholt. Are you aware that the sheep experiment station has nearly 50 years of research on the sage-grouse?    Mr. Aderholt. I think what needs to be said is the research is very important, as 11 western States and the community farmers and ranchers industry and our Federal agencies are trying to avoid the listing of the sage-grouse under the Endangered Species Act.    Let me quickly go to one more question and propose this to Dr. Ramaswamy. The budget proposed $80 million in new funding to create two new innovation institutes, as I had mentioned in my opening remarks, the Biomanufacturing Institute and the Nanocellulosics Institute.    The fiscal year 2015 budget request, NIFA proposed creating three new innovation institutes for pollinators, bioenergy manufacturing, and antimicrobial resistance.    What would a Biomanufacturing Institute and a Nanocellulosics Institute accomplish?    Mr. Aderholt. How will the funding be allocated and awarded?    Mr. Aderholt. Okay. My time is up.    Mr. Farr.    Mr. Aderholt. Dr. Harris.    Mr. Aderholt. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Aderholt. Okay. Thank you, Ms. Pingree.    Well, thanks to the panel for being here today. Glad we could have this discussion today on all the issues, but especially regarding MARC.    I appreciate the steps that ARS and the Department has taken, but I think we would all like to see things handled differently. There is still a lot of unanswered questions out there.    As you know, the Subcommittee must be able to confidently and fully justify all of its funding recommendations, including the recommendations for ARS. And let me just say at this point I am not sure we are at the point where we can do that.    But, as such, we will be sending a formal request for information, and I look forward to going through this as we go forward and get a prompt reply to those questions for information.    I do want to note that Betsy Bina is leaving us. She is actually not going far. That is the good news. But she has been responsible for a lot of the issues we have worked with on this Subcommittee and, in particular, research is one of the many things that we have relied on her expertise over the years.    So she is going to just be moving to another position in the Appropriations Committee. But we appreciate her hard work here over the past 4 years on this Subcommittee and wish her well. But, like I said, the good thing is, hopefully, we will be seeing her because she's not going far.    But, Betsy, we wish you the best. .    And, with that, the hearing is adjourned.
