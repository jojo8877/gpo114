    Ms. Clarke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank our Ranking Member. I, of course, thank our panelists this afternoon for your updates regarding the agency's activities.    I have a few concerns that I would like to have you address, and one of them worries me a bit, and it is what is not in your testimony, it is how the Commission will address continuing challenges in diversity and representation in the media and telecom industries. We are in the 21st century. We look at our nation, and its diversity, and I think there is a widespread acknowledgement that what we see, in terms of industry, is really just not reflective of who we are as a country.    So I would like to ask, first of all, Chairman Wheeler, where is the Commission's focus on the completion of the diversity studies, and how can this data be used to create more nuanced and tailored policies and reforms that advance equity and inclusion? And second to that is what metrics and accountability structures are in place to ensure that vulnerable populations and their communities will be adequately served through these proposals?    Ms. Clarke. So on the subject of DEs, and Commissioner Pai, excuse me, I will have you respond as well. It appears that we have probably cracked the code of only one part of supporting small businesses, gained access to capital to enable to compete in the wireless industry. How can the Commission facilitate more secondary market transactions for DEs and other small businesses, especially those owned by women and minorities, with the private sector?    Ms. Clarke. Thank you, Chairman. Commissioner, I have run out of time, but hopefully we can get a response from you as well. Thank you.
