    Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank the witnesses for being here, especially Mr. Gold. I think you have some familiarity with southern Nevada from your time at Bigelow. A lot of people who come to my district get transported to another dimension, but they don't usually think about it as space travel. So appreciate your knowledge.    I would like to address my question to you, Mr. Gold, and to Dr. Nield. You know, we are just a couple of weeks away from the reauthorization again of the FAA bill. The Senate has passed a version. And we have a version over here on the House side that calls for a privatization of air traffic control system. Part of the problem with that is that it puts the decisionmaking in the hands of a commission or a committee that is dominated by just primarily one special interest and leaves out a lot of the players, including commercial space industry.    So I would ask you, Mr. Gold, if you would be satisfied with a system that where they determine rates and access and every bit of use of airspace where you are not at the table? And I would ask Dr. Nield if he would comment on kind of the relationship between the Office of Commercial Space and air traffic. And I know it is a substantial one, and what kind of challenges would be posed if we moved to this new system that is in the House bill?    Ms. Titus. That is right.    Ms. Titus. Thank you.    Doctor.    Ms. Titus. So you think it would work out if you privatize air traffic controllers and they don't have a seat at the table and you are kind of taken out of the picture?    Ms. Titus. OK. Thank you.
