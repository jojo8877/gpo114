    Mrs. Love. I first of all just wanted to say thank you for the invite and letting me know that our attorney general and Mr. Ballard from Operation Underground Railroad is here. The work that they do is so incredibly important. It is something that is very important in the State of Utah, but also for our Nation and around the world.    This is not based on fiscal issues. This is not based on party issues. This is what we have to do, and that is you are protecting life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This is a moral issue, and I wanted to say thank you so much for making this such an important part of what you do.    I have three children, two girls, one boy, and it makes me feel better as a parent knowing that there are some good people out there doing this work and making sure that the predators know that we will not rest. We will be diligent and we are watching them and we are putting them out of business. So from the bottom of my heart as a parent, as an American who cares about the children all around this world, thank you for the work that you do, and thank you for this committee for taking this issue so seriously.
