    Mr. Russell. I appreciate all the hard work that the panel has done. And I think it is a tough task that you have dug into in a great bipartisan fashion. My questions will focus specifically on the training aspects, because I think that is what is crucial ultimately in getting the job done. If the personnel currently are too deployed to train, how will the additional uniformed and other agents be trained?    Mr. Russell. So with the increase in the additional agents, obviously you are going to have to absorb those to be able to train them?    Mr. Russell. It is almost counterproductive because they are already too deployed, you are going to put a bunch of new agents, make the recommendation that that happens and then--and that is the focus of the question is how would that be absorbed?    Mr. Russell. Thank you. I think all of us are just taken aback by the 25 minutes of average training. As a former combat infantryman, that is just astounding when you are entrusted with so many things, where you may have to protect somebody's life. That just seems totally inadequate. Did any of that 25 minutes of training include sustaining the accurate employment of firearms?    Mr. Russell. So what specifically then was the training focused on? I mean, if you had other aspects of training, here we are quoting 25 minutes but, you know, obviously firearms training or maybe drills training or protecting people that have been injured or whatever it might be, what aspects of training were you looking at?    Mr. Russell. Sure.    Mr. Russell. And then were there any training recommendations that you made focused on proper reduction of threats and uniform rules of engagement?    Mr. Russell. I appreciate that. And I do appreciate the sensitivity on that. And I guess I was, my question was focused, did you recommend a standard uniform rules of engagement?    Mr. Russell. I see. That answers it. Thank you. I yield back my time.
