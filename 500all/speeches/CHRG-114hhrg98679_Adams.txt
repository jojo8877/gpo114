    Ms. Adams. Thank you, Madam Chair, and Ranking Member McGovern. Thank you all for your testimony. It has been very interesting to hear the stories. Farmers' markets have become a very popular way to improve fresh food options in food deserts throughout the 12th District, and we have a lot of them in the 12th District of North Carolina that I represent. Guilford County is currently using USDA funding to support farmers' markets in food deserts, including the Mobile Oasis Farmers' Market in Greensboro and High Point. Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Grants, and the Farmers' Market Promotion Program are vital programs for supporting one of the few grocery store alternatives available to residents living in food deserts.    As mobile and seasonal retailers in farmers' markets usually use wireless equipment for processing SNAP benefits, this requires a farmers' market to contract out equipment, and to pay a transaction fee for every purchase that uses SNAP benefits. For smaller business owners or farmers, this is a significant barrier to allowing a SNAP recipient to use their benefits to purchase fresh produce.    Dr. Hesterman, what long-term solutions would you recommend for USDA in order to meet Congress's intent that healthy food retailers not face cost barriers to serving participants in the SNAP Program?    Ms. Adams. Yes, a great strategy. Ms. Petee, there is much interest in my district in encouraging convenience stores to sell more fresh fruits and vegetables. Can you tell me a little bit about how the Live Well Toledo initiative worked with convenience stores to sell more produce, and what incentives or processes were put in place to help convenience stores who were concerned that they would take a loss from selling produce?    Ms. Adams. Thank you very much, and, Madam Chair, I am out of time. I will yield back.    The Chairwoman. Thank you. The chair recognizes Congressman Thompson, for 5 minutes.
