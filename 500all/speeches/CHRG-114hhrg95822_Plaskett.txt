    Ms. Plaskett. Yes. Thank you so much for your time. I don't have that many questions. I know there's been quite a bit of discussion going back and forth on this, and that Ranking Member Lawrence did ask some questions previously.    I just had just a couple that I wanted to speak on. Mr. Brown, I know that this was asked to Mr. Cottingham, but, Mr. Brown, your testimony about the guides in the back country for several days have to keep logs of sleep time and any interruptions. The value of meals they eat have to be calculated and added to hourly computation for overtime wages. Is that correct that keeping these records are not specified in the executive order?    Ms. Plaskett. But it would be something that you would expect to be kept?    Ms. Plaskett. And how would that change the amount of wages that individuals are receiving if you were to calculate that as well?    Ms. Plaskett. Right. Because you're sleeping probably almost as much as you're working. Right?    Ms. Plaskett. Okay. Well, that's how I work, but I don't know how other people--but it would significantly make the amount of pay that individuals are receiving per hour of a significant change?    Ms. Plaskett. And when we talk about the gross pay, Mr. Cottingham, in earlier testimony there was discussion about average salaries for the summer, $300 to $500 a summer. How many months is that?    Ms. Plaskett. Okay. Okay. The employment period is how long?    Ms. Plaskett. Okay. So for 6 or 7 weeks they're making how much in gross pay?    Ms. Plaskett. So the $300 to $500 amount, what is that? Per week, then? Is that what this is?    Ms. Plaskett. Okay.    Ms. Plaskett. All right. Thank you for that clarification.    Mr. Brown, you can you describe any other specific burdens that the executive order will generate for businesses?    Ms. Plaskett. But that would just be good business practice anyway. Would it not?    Ms. Plaskett. Okay. And, Mr. Lazzeri--is that the correct----    Ms. Plaskett. Okay. I'm very particular about the pronunciation of my name. So I try to get people's correct.    How do you respond to business concerns about the increased labor cost affecting profitability? And then how has the Department responded to that if there are those business concerns?    Ms. Plaskett. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much for the time.
