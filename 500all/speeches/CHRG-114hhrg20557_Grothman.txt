    Mr. Grothman. Sure. I want to talk to Ms. Rose a little bit. You are kind of one of the stars of the day because your satisfaction scores are some of the biggest increases out here. Could you just give us a general background on some of the initiatives that you may have started in the last few years that are reasons for the big increase in your scores?    Mr. Grothman. See, that is the nicest question asked by any of them, so ----    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Is there anything you did in particular to address leadership styles among your folks?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Now, I see on the screen next to me that they are calling votes on the Floor. That is what they pay us the big bucks for. Mr. Chairman, you want to take over?
