    Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing, and I would like to say, I do agree with Mr. Rohrabacher, except for I do believe in global climate change, but I think together we need to work to bring, you know, nuclear energy--it's something that we have to, first of all, maintain America's leadership on the innovation when it comes to nuclear energy and nuclear technologies, and we need to transition to advanced nuclear technologies, like fast reactors. And I hope to get language in the Competes bill supporting advanced nuclear reactor test facilities. So I think it's very important that we do move ahead, and research is critical, and that's what we're here to talk about.    For Dr. Peters, Illinois has been a leader in nuclear reactors since the first reactor was developed by Enrico Fermi at Met Lab, now renamed Argonne. Thank you for your leadership in keeping Argonne, and Illinois, a leader in nuclear energy innovation. Moving forward, I want to ask, what are Argonne's research and development priorities, and how do these priorities compliment work at other national labs, and fit into the DOE's strategic direction?    Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. And I also want to move on to other collaborations, specifically between the national labs and industry, because I think that's important to improve U.S. research investments by leveraging private sector expertise, and helping to bring new technology to the market. I know Argonne has been particularly effective in engaging with the private sector, for example collaborating with General Electric on the development of experimental boiling water reactors. These reactors now make up about 1/3 of the U.S. reactor fleet. So I wanted to ask you, Dr. Peters, what can we do here in Washington to support these types of collaborations?    Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. And I'll yield back.
