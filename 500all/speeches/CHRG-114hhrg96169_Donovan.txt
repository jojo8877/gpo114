    Mr. Donovan. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Doctor, I was just wondering if you could help me understand this a little bit. There has been a lot of criticism in the reportings about the breach that EINSTEIN didn't work.    My understanding is that it did what it was built to do and it was part of a multi-layered approach to securing the data and part of this defense-in-depth theory.    Did EINSTEIN actually do what it was created to do?    Mr. Donovan. Please.    Mr. Donovan. Doctor, I am not well-versed in computers. In fact, I still have a VCR that blinks 12.    Just so you could clarify for me, it seems that EINSTEIN was created to block known intruders rather than allowing friendly traffic to come through and block everyone else who is not identified as friendly.    I understand from your analogy about the superintendent that even that wouldn't have worked in this case because the intruder was looked upon as a friendly user.    But is it a better system to just allow friendly users instead of just blocking people who we know because we don't know who all the intruders are?    Mr. Donovan. Thank you, Doctor.    Chairman, I yield back my time.
