    Admiral Caldwell. US Navy warship requirements determine naval fuel system design features including use of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel. Substituting low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel for the HEU in current naval fuel systems would decrease reactor energy and lead to more frequent reactor refueling. LEU fuel would fundamentally decrease the available energy in a naval reactor, thereby reducing a naval warship's availability and longevity. The impact of LEU may be mitigated in aircraft carriers by developing an advanced naval fuel that could increase uranium loading beyond what is practical today and meet the rigorous performance requirements for naval reactors. An advanced fuel system might enable either higher performance with HEU fuel or use of LEU fuel in aircraft carriers. Advanced fuel development is estimated to take about $1 billion, 10-15 years to develop, and would have to begin well in advance of any ship application. Successful development of an advanced fuel system is not assured.    Switching to LEU fuel in naval reactors would be beneficial in allowing the U.S. to take a leadership role in non-proliferation by reducing the need to produce new HEU. Although an LEU development program would likely not produce a more militarily desirable reactor design, the knowledge gained during the research and development work would be beneficial to advance the state-of-the-art in U.S. naval reactor design and manufacturing. Fuel development work would also help sustain and build the cadre of highly specialized naval fuel experts and unique fuel irradiation and post irradiation examination infrastructure.    Admiral Caldwell. Naval Reactors' entire budget supports the safe and effective operation of the nuclear-powered Fleet, today and tomorrow. Naval Reactors' funding requests can be directly linked to this single, over-arching priority of supporting the safe and effective operation of the nuclear-powered fleet. In FY 2017, this entails effective oversight of the operation and maintenance of 97 reactors in 73 submarines, 10 aircraft carriers, and 4 training and research reactors. This priority will be met in the most effective and judicious way possible.    The main budget components that support today's operating fleet are Naval Reactors Operations and Infrastructure (NOI), Naval Reactors Development (NRD), Program Direction and Construction. The remainder of the budget, primarily OHIO-Class Replacement Reactor Systems Development, S8G Prototype Refueling and the Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project, supports tomorrow's fleet. In FY 2017, the OHIO-Class Replacement project will continue life of the ship reactor core manufacturing development activities and detailed design of reactor plant heavy equipment to support FY 2019 GFE procurement. The S8G Prototype Refueling project will complete construction of the Radiological Work and Storage Building and commence refueling equipment checkout and training at the shipyards. The Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project will finalize key facility and equipment requirements and advance facility design to support establishing the Performance Baseline in FY 2018 and the start of construction in FY 2019.    Our budget is aligned with the larger Navy. We work closely every day with our partners in the Navy to ensure that our budget is aligned with the mission, performance requirements and schedules.    Specifically, for the OHIO-Class Replacement program, the Department of Energy and Navy efforts are directed at supporting this schedule, including development of the propulsion plant design to support procurement of long-lead components in FY 2019 to support a construction start in FY 2021 and ship delivery in FY 2028. After completing ship operational testing, the first OHIO-Class Replacement must be on strategic patrol by 2031 to meet STRATCOM force level requirements. Given that the first OHIO-Class Replacement submarine, a ship twice the size of the VIRGINIA-Class submarine, is planned to be constructed within the same span of time; this schedule is aggressive and requires close coupling of Department of Energy and Department of Navy activities to ensure on time ship delivery.    The design and construction of OHIO-Class Replacement is a complex effort that requires extensive coordination between not only Naval Reactors and the Navy's Shipbuilders, but also the Navy's Strategic Systems Programs that are responsible for the missile systems and the British Navy, who will use the Common Missile Compartment design in their upcoming SSBNs. Because they each depend so heavily on each other, these four design efforts must be synchronized, in close collaboration to retire risk early and minimize estimated construction costs.    Given the criticality of Naval Reactors' Department of Energy activities to Navy priorities and mission, funding cuts to Naval Reactors' DOE budget can adversely impact strategic objectives and plans, especially ship design and construction and nuclear operator training.                                 ______                                     Admiral Caldwell. The report on the feasibility of using LEU in naval reactors is currently in interagency review. Upon completion of the interagency review, Naval Reactors will formally sign out the report and provide it to the congressional defense committees.                                 ______
