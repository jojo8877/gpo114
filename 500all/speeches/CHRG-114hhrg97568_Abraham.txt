    Dr. Abraham. Thank you, Madam Chair.    I guess first I'll express my disappointment for the Chief Information Officer Ms. Seymour not--or declining our invitation to come speak here. It's my understanding that she has extensive involvement in preparing this system. Might I suggest that if OPM had put extensive involvement in preventing this, we might not even be having this hearing. So just that as a statement.    Mr. Wilshusen, I'm going to start with you. Has the federal government's response to this breach in your opinion been sufficient?    Dr. Abraham. And I'll follow up with you, Mr. Wilshusen. Knowing what you know about the cybersecurity or lack thereof of all our federal agencies, would you entrust any of your sensitive information with any of these agencies?    Dr. Abraham. And it's my understanding that the GAO tracks the history of these breaches. How does this OPM recent breach compare or where does it rank in the history of the other government breaches as far as the tracking is concerned?    Dr. Abraham. Right.    Dr. Abraham. Mr. Esser, you said in your testimony that the OPM leadership has been--has not been forthright about the claim of proactively shutting down the e-QIP system. Can you tell us how long the OPM has known about these vulnerabilities to that particular one system?    Dr. Abraham. Okay. Thank you.    Madam Chair, I'll yield back.    Chairwoman Comstock. Thank you, Mr. Abraham.    Ms. Esty.
