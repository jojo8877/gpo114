    Mr. Takai. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you also for focusing today's hearing on the Asia-Pacific as you know, that is very important for people from Hawaii.    I wanted to welcome our witnesses. Under Secretary, Admiral, and General, thank you very much for coming.    Admiral Locklear, it is my understanding that the Pacific Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet are funded through separate budget offices. Can you speak to what advantages that has and how it supports the geographical combatant commander?    Mr. Takai. Great. I appreciate that answer.    And then are there any efforts underway to expand the use of training areas in the Pacific to support engagements of our regional partners and allies and more broadly connect ranges throughout the AOR ? And can you speak specifically to the Pohakuloa Training Area on the Big Island and the Pacific Missile Range on Kauai, some of the infrastructure needs there, and more importantly, how resources are being allocated to support upgrades at training ranges in the PACOM AOR?    Mr. Takai. Thank you.    And, you know, this last question is something very important for people, especially on Oahu, and it is in regards to our groundwater supply.    So it is my understanding that recently meetings were conducted between PACOM and the DLA Energy regarding the Red Hill underground fuel facility. And though we know that fuel storage is necessary and important to support strategy and posture of your AOR, what is the plan to upgrade the aging infrastructure to ensure that communities that surround Red Hill, in addition the Halawa Aquifer that supplies about half the island with their water, are safe from contamination of, are safe regarding the water supply?    Mr. Takai. Thank you.    And, thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield back.
