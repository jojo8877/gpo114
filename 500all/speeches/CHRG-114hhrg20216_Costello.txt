    Mr. Costello. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To both the gentlemen, depending on the proposed infrastructure project, the Department of State often times must also issue permits. And the question becomes what are you doing to ensure that proposals considered under the pilot program are in accord with the State Department's project, and how are you coordinating with the Department of State as it may be applicable on the front end to ensure that there are no delays to the project as a result of Department of State requirements somewhere along the line.    And if you have experienced any delays along the line, do you have any recommendations in order to--how we might be able to get the Department of State to be a bit more accommodative, if that question may be applicable?    Mr. Costello. Thanks. I will yield back.
