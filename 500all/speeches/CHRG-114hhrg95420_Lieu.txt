    Mr. Lieu. Thank you. Let me first thank the panel for your public service.    And I have questions about the laboratory inspections in the report. And it's my understanding that both the EPA and the FDA conduct laboratory inspections, is that correct?    Mr. Lieu. And based on reports analysis, many of the regulations are very similar for both these agencies?    Mr. Lieu. And as a result, for example, some laboratories in Maryland unknowingly were inspected by both agencies. One in Maryland was inspected eight times by the EPA and FDA roughly in the same time period. Is that correct?    Mr. Lieu. Do these agencies talk to each other before they go do these inspections?    Mr. Lieu. Are these surprise inspections or do the folks know they're coming?    Mr. Lieu. It could be as simple as just notifying the other agency, right, that you're about----    Mr. Lieu. It's not rocket science.    Mr. Lieu. Okay. All right.    Mr. Lieu. When did that agreement that they used to have expire, do you remember?    Mr. Lieu. Were these the only two agencies you serve find duplication in terms of laboratories, in terms of inspections?    Mr. Lieu. Do you also look at duplication between other levels of government, such as State or county?    Mr. Lieu. I came from the California State Legislature, and I had noticed duplication in various areas. So I'm glad you're moving in that direction. I remember looking at weights and measures and some supermarkets would get inspected pretty much exactly the same thing, by the Federal, State, and city. So I commend you for going in that area, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Lieu. Great. Thank you.
