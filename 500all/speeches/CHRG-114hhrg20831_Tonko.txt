    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and welcome to our panel. What a fascinating panel. Let me congratulate you and all the people and institutions who have inspired this tremendous moment. It's truly a phenomenal success, and certainly I'm grateful to the people who had the vision and pursued based upon the seed that they planted to be determined to come to the success that we've met. So I anxiously look forward to what else is out there, and you know, and can't wait to see what is yet to come. And if this doesn't serve, if this doesn't illustrate the value added of high-risk, high-reward basic research, I don't know what does. So hopefully we get the message, we invest deeply and soundly in research and move forward.    My question would be to all of you, any of you, what role did partners in industry play in the design and development of the--of this new technology? Certainly you've got infrastructure that we've seen in your slide presentations. There was a lot of talent you had to draw upon, so can you describe that, please?    Mr. Tonko. Right. Anyone else that----    Mr. Tonko. Was there anything unique in the collaborations that you developed as a LIGO industry? Was there anything in particular that was a different approach?    Mr. Tonko. Well, it just shows the emphasis that we have on science and engineering, scientists and engineers to make it all happen.    And just quickly, Dr. Reitze, you made mention of the commitment of NSF to fund the development of LIGO as a scientific moon shot. Can you elaborate upon that?    Mr. Tonko. Well, thank you, and again, congratulations, and with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
