    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Heard, in the past the VA has transferred millions of dollars to OPM under an interagency agreement where the money sat unobligated for more than 2 years. What controls have you put in place to ensure this doesn't happen again?    And this is a very timely question because we're going to have the Secretary come in tomorrow, I believe it's the Secretary, and say that you need billions of dollars more. And the controls for accounting for where the money goes and how it's spent seem to be lacking.    So how would you answer that question? What controls have you put in place to ensure that this doesn't happen again with these types of contracts?    Mr. Lamborn. Okay. Thank you.    Now, when it comes to assessing the contracts and how well they perform, how would you assess FFRDC performance and ensure that we're getting--the VA is getting their money's worth out of these programs?    Mr. Lamborn. Okay. Thank you.    And, Ms. Mackin, I have a question for you now. By their very nature, FFRDC contracts are noncompetitive. Is VA at risk of paying too much for FFRDC work that could potentially be competitively awarded?    Mr. Lamborn. Okay. Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
