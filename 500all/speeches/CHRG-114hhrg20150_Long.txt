    Mr. Long. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Doyle kind of hit on this question earlier, but your agency still needs to fulfill 16 of the 42 mandates from the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act. And in your testimony you mentioned that ten mandates will be addressed as part of the current rulemaking activities, but the remaining six are tied to reports and information collections. Why are several of these still in the early information collection phase?    Mr. Long. So tell me again the technology is advancing and that is slowing down the--I mean technology is advancing all the time.    Mr. Long. OK, because what I am kind of looking for is how we can speed up that process and get the information. So production of liquefied--excuse me, I didn't know I had a frog in my throat before I started this. Production of liquefied natural gas has increased significantly, as you know, in the last few years. How has your agency kept up with the LNG boom and have you been able to effectively update codes and design standards to keep up with this boom?    Mr. Long. How effectively do you work with FERC as a coordinating agency for siting and reviewing LNG facilities?    Mr. Long. In your testimony, you mention the important role states play in inspecting and enforcing both federal and state regulations. How closely do you work with these states in developing those regulations?    Mr. Long. Of the what?    Mr. Long. OK, so setting safety standards, things of that nature?    Mr. Long. OK, thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
