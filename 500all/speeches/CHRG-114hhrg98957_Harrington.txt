    Ms. Harrington. First, thank you very much for the question and particularly for recognizing what is very important in my line of business, which is the evolving and emerging threats.    To go back to your initial question very quickly on the R&D side, we have two programs specifically in the R&D area that address those issues. We have what we call our Material and Weapons Development Program that looks at nuclear fuel cycle, especially challenges from noncooperative foreign environments. That looks at advanced technologies for detecting proliferant activities, such as nuclear material production, related facilities, equipment processes, and that is about $80 million that is in this budget for that.    And then we have another area called Ground-Based Nuclear Event Monitoring, and that is the detection of low yield and evasive tests, seismic and radionuclide detection, and exploitation of what we call our dynamic sensor network data, so how do we better interpret the data that we are collecting through all of the systems that we have deployed.    So the goal of these is to meet emerging requirements, to detect and significantly lower the thresholds at which we can detect evasive testing.    Ms. Harrington. The decrease in the budget in R&D specifically?    Ms. Harrington. That is related to a one-time expenditure that we don't have to make again. Part of it is related to a classified case where we have found a solution to a problem that we thought we were going to have to extend into future budgets.
