    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chair, and Mr. Malinowski, I want to thank you personally for your tireless work on human rights, especially in Vietnam. I generally appreciate the open dialogue that we have had, and the work that you have done, and I went along with the chair, visiting Vietnam, and getting a chance to see you.    I want to talk about something that you mentioned in your testimony here that I think has--and, you know, the thing that we will be actually looking at and voting on very soon. And that is the--although you talk about the TPP, right now, we, as you know, we will be voting on the TPA, the promotion authority. But you say in your submitted testimony that the TPP agreement will include a requirement that Vietnam guarantee freedom of association by allowing workers to form genuinely independent trade unions.    Can you expand to us on what that cause really will look like, and how are we going to be able, the United States and others, to hold Vietnam accountable? And has there been--has Vietnam taken any steps today, before the TPP goes into effect, to actually develop independent trade, or is this something that they are saying they will do in the future?    Mr. Lowenthal. That is right, those are the critical questions for me in terms of labor issues.    Mr. Lowenthal. Yes.    Mr. Lowenthal. That is right, labor strikes.    Mr. Lowenthal. That is right.    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, and I yield back, Mr. Chair.    I will submit the rest of my questions in writing.
