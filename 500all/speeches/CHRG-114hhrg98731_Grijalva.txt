    Mr. Grijalva. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you for being here, Dr. King. I appreciate it very much. And best of luck on your confirmation.    In this President's budget we once again see an increase in the funding for charter schools. And given all the discussion that goes back and forth on that concept, whether it's for-profit or public charters, that we've seen in the past, one of the questions that I have, that I think is something that I think lags behind in the effort to increase the funding at a time when some of the categorical programs are losing funding and traditional public schools are losing funding, how will the Department ensure that there's some really basic accountability to these entities?    How will these entities communicate to students and parents that make the choice to enter a charter school, everything from financial disclosure, what is proprietary and not in terms of the entities that run these, and regulatory issues, the public's right to know, public disclosure, public meetings, so that people can attend and know what is outside of a financial boardroom but is in a public setting?    These are questions I think that as we move forward in the initiatives of this administration on charter schools that lagging behind is the taxpayer accountability as to how this money is being used. And what do you propose in that area in general?    And before you answer, let me just indicate to you, Dr. King, let me associate myself with Mr. Hinojosa's comments relative to minority-serving institutions as a whole.    Sir?    Mr. Grijalva. Should there, Dr. King, be a basic template, though, disclosure, financial, posting of meetings so that people can attend, limiting what is proprietary and not in terms of financial issues and salary issues that are questions people ask, but there's always that wall? Do you think there should be a basic template at the very minimum?    Mr. Grijalva. I yield back, Mr. Chair.
