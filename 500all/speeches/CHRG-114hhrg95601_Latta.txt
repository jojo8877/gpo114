    Mr. Latta. I appreciate the chairman for yielding, and you are absolutely right. We all love those hot water heaters when you get in there in the shower in the morning. But Mr. Chairman, thanks again for having this very important hearing today to discuss this very important legislation to modify the efficiency standards for grid-enabled hot water heaters. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the legislation. I hope the committee can advance the legislation quickly as you said, and that there is great bipartisan support.    The rural electric cooperatives are very important in my district. They provide power to agriculture and manufacturing operations that are important to the local, State, and national and global economy. In fact, I have seven rural electric co-ops in my district, and all seven use voluntary demand response programs to reduce peak demand, increase the use of renewable energy, and decrease costs to the consumer. This legislation permits the continued manufacturing of electric resistant hot water heaters above 75 gallons for use in thermal energy storage and demand response programs. Enabling the manufacturing of these water heaters is vital for the demand response programs. I look forward to today's testimony, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. I appreciate it. Thank you.
