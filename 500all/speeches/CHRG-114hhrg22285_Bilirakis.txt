    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it so very much, and I thank the panel for their testimony.    Patent demand letters reform is an important part of curbing abusive practices that hurt legitimate businesses, as you know. However, I am concerned that overly broad definitions of patent assertion entities in other provisions that have been proposed, such as fee shifting and joinder, will limit our Nation's research universities, and their ability to have patented research discoveries transferred to start up receiving venture funding that can develop and commercialize these early discoveries.    The University of South Florida, just outside of my district in Tampa, Florida, is a world leader in university-based patents, licenses and startup companies, and is a major regional economic hub and job creator in our area.    Again, Ms. Ranieri and Professor Gugliuzza, excuse me if I mispronounce, what do you believe is the appropriate balance to ensure that the technology transfer process thrives, while simultaneously implementing the real reform targeted at bad actors with no intention to commercialize innovations?    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you.    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you. Anyone else on the panel like to respond to that question? OK, thank you. I will move on if that is OK.    Ms. Ranieri and Professor Gugliuzza, what factors do you believe should be prioritized when determining standards for demanding--demand letters that would address the abusive patent troll practices, while still preserving the legitimate patent holder's ability to negotiate license agreements with potential infringers?    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you.    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you very much.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate that.
