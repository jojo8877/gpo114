    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    As ranking member of the IT Subcommittee, I have been working with Chairman Hurd on the very issue of legacy systems. One of the topics consistently discussed is moving to the cloud.    The CIO.gov Web site says the government's current information technology environment is characterized by, and I quote, ``low-asset utilization, a fragmented demand for resources, duplicative systems, environments that are difficult to manage, and long procurement times.'' It goes on to say, and I quote, ``Cloud computing has a potential to play a major part in addressing these inefficiencies.''    Mr. Scott, can you briefly explain what is cloud computing?    Ms. Kelly. So you started explaining what an important role it can play in helping agencies modernize their IT systems. Can you expand on that?    Ms. Kelly. Can you tell us what, if anything, the Office of Management and Budget has been doing to encourage agencies to move toward cloud computing solutions?    Ms. Kelly. I'm glad to hear that, because I wondered in another hearing, but didn't get a chance to ask the question, about how often do we share.    Back in July 2010, David McClure, then associate administrator of the General Services Administration, testified before this committee that cloud computing would, and I quote, ``increase the overall IT security posture of the government.''    Can you explain how cloud computing can improve the Federal Government's overall IT security?    Ms. Kelly. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
