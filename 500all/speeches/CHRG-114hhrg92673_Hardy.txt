    Mr. Hardy. About 70 percent, yeah.    Mr. Hardy. Costello.    Mr. Hardy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    First, I would just like to thank the chairman for the opportunity to be on this committee. Being involved in the construction industry, being involved in the regional transportation commission for many years in my State, I feel like I am well versed in many of the issues on this committee and appreciate that opportunity to be here.    Mr. Hardy. How about that?    Mr. Hardy. Thanks. Can you hear me in now?    Anyway, being a new member on this committee, I would like to ask a question, a little out of line here, but in the past, on these reauthorization regulations that are set up, is there collaboration between the private sector and the public sector on the efficiency of this? And the reason I bring this up is, the State and local levels all over the country, because of this recession, have got together and been in the construction industry. We have worked together with those State and local entities to create a program to where we can build bridges and tunnels and dams more efficiently, cost-effectively, and still maintain a high standard of safety. So is that done in this process with the FAA?    Mr. Hardy. Thank you.    Another question I have. Mr. Conner and Mr. Hilkemann, you both have a vast amount of experience. You know your companies and industries very well. Instead of us telling you how to run your company and how we should restrict you, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on--tell us how regulations should be structured if you were in charge of the bases? And also please share with the committee the regulations that are hindering your company that pertains to your industry.    Mr. Hardy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
