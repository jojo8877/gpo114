    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the heat is on, right, to perform. I thank each of the panelists as well.    Ms. Franklin, appreciate your testimony. It is a Hallmark testimony.    Mr. Walberg. We know that employer-based wellness programs generally have two thrusts, one at least most of the employers that I meet in my district truly care about their employees. You might find an occasional one that is more materialistic. For the most part, they really care about them and what to see them be successful, healthy, and continue to work.    On the other side, there are certain cost savings to have coverage for employees that are healthy as opposed to ones that have repairable or preventable health issues. We understand at least when you look at it in common sense, why would not an employer want to encourage healthy employees in using wellness programs to do that, but we are also understand more importantly there are employers that are very fearful of what EEOC is looking at, in direct contradiction to what is being pushed in the Affordable Care Act, with the First Lady's nutrition proposals, et cetera, and so with the liability concerns that go on there, there are challenges.    I would like, if you would, to speak more fully on the importance of employer-based wellness programs to a healthy workforce, and then secondly, what are some of the hurdles that you encounter as a result of what I believe is EEOC's overreach?    Mr. Walberg. It does work, does it not?    Mr. Walberg. Thank you. Ms. McDonough, as you well know, the EEOC has recently become very engaged in employer sponsored wellness programs, and will soon issue new regulations as it relates to the ADA and GINA.    How has the EEOC's involvement chilled wellness programs affected you specifically?    Mr. Walberg. Also, for the employee, it certainly makes it feel more voluntary if they understand the benefits to them.    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, I yield back.
