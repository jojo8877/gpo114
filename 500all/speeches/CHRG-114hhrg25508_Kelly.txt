    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Administrator Neffenger, you have talked about the idea that more and more people are traveling and that TSA needs more workers. I wanted to concentrate a little bit more on pre-check. How many passengers are currently enrolled in pre-check?    Ms. Kelly. And what number do you think that can grow to?    Ms. Kelly. And what are you doing to encourage passengers to join the program?    Ms. Kelly. I typically fly in and out of O'Hare or sometimes Midway, and what my colleagues said about sometime the pre-check lines are actually longer than the regular lines, but the other thing is all of the carry-on luggage because of what the airlines charge, people are carrying more and more luggage on and stuffing more and more things in the luggage. And according to the New York Times, the big four airlines--American, Southwest, Delta, and United--made $22 billion in profit from their charges. And I wanted to know--that is one of the sources of growing profits in the airline. And what portion of that from the airlines goes toward paying any airport security? Do they contribute in any way?    Ms. Kelly. And I wonder if we should do more calling on the airlines to help address the consequences of their business decisions on the TSA screening process because the more they charge, the less people are going to check their bags. I think American is $35 for a piece of luggage. What do you think about that?    Ms. Kelly. And it's something they should look at because if everyone carries luggage on, that slows up people getting on the airplane and the on-time record and on and on and on so ----    Ms. Kelly. I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
