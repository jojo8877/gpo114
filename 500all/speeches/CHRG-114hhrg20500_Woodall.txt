    Mr. Woodall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I have heard a common theme of a new frontier and emerging industry, young industry. Mr. Lopez-Alegria, help me understand what the tipping point is when it does move to the common carriage that Mr. MacCallum mentioned. When do we stop having the conversation about an immature industry and start having the conversation about safety and a mature industry that is ready for commercial travel?    Mr. Woodall. Will it be obvious to me as an outside observer what the difference is between an adventurer and an explorer and someone who is seeking common carriage? How do I tell that transition is happening?    Mr. Woodall. Mr. MacCallum, I agree with you. I think a stable regulatory foundation is what our economy is built upon. But I have looked at your Web site. I have thought about packing a picnic basket and getting a few friends and coming over. Because I think I understand balloon travel. And I would be regulated for safety today on anybody's balloon but yours.    What was that process for the FAA that distinguished what you are doing as space travel as opposed to just the common balloon experience I would expect?    Mr. Woodall. I thank you all for your expertise.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
