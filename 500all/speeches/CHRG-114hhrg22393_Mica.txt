    Mr. Mica. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Well, we're spending a lot of money on this facility. I guess it's in the billion-dollar range, if that's correct. And we're designing it--well, it was designed an unsafe or unsecure manner based on some requirements that we should be following. We have--State relies on--the State Department relies on an unpublished 2003 draft memorandum between the Bureaus of Overseas Buildings Operations and Diplomatic Security rather than Federal law and FAM. Is that correct?    Mr. Mica. But it doesn't appear that, again, that there was proper procedure and proper consideration for security given the final design.    Mr. Mica. Okay. So that's a recommendation to avoid the----    Mr. Mica. I think that's very important.    Again, we're--you know, the thing is under construction and the design is there. This was built to the Inman specifications?    Mr. Mica. And the new design, does that include all of the embassy functions? Are there other functions, like Foreign Commercial Service operations, in other facilities around London? I'm not familiar with what we've got outside of the embassy there.    Mr. Mica. But do we rent other----    Mr. Mica. But they will be co-located in this facility?    Mr. Mica. How about Foreign Commercial Service operations?    Mr. Mica. And will there be--my other question--will there be some outside?    Mr. Mica. I visited Paris, I went to the Paris Air Show and then spent a day looking at our facilities in Paris, because we knew after Hebdo that it could be a target. And they chose not to go after the hardened targets now, you know, a cafe, or a restaurant, a theater. And people at a Christmas party are their new targets.    But any other recommendations you have in changing the law so that we don't have the hiccups we have with this particular project?    Mr. Mica. I yield back.
