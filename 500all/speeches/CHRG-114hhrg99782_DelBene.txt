    Ms. DelBene. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thanks to all of you for spending time with us today. As you know, the DOJ opposes mergers or acquisitions when it finds that a transaction would unduly concentrate market share, eliminate competition to the detriment of consumers. So, for example, GE withdrew an attempted sale of its appliance business to Electrolux after the DOJ filed suit to block the sale based on similar types of concerns.    So I wanted to start with Dr. Morton. Do you think some of the same market conditions appear in ITC investigations and--where a complainant seeks to ban a large percentage of products and players in question?    Ms. DelBene. And Mr. Bianchi or Ms. Okun, do you feel--yeah, how does the ITC take into consideration the effect on competitive conditions when you are looking at your public interest analysis? You can look at each other and decide who wants to go first.    Ms. DelBene. Ms. Okun, go ahead.    Ms. DelBene. Certainly.    Ms. DelBene. Dr. Scott Morton, you looked like you were going to----    Ms. DelBene. Thank you. My time has expired. I yield back, Mr. Chair.
