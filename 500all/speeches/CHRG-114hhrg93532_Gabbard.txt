    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. My question is with regards to the AUMF that is before Congress and Syria and wondering as it states in the AUMF action against ISIL or associated persons, would there be an interpretation of this that would permit the U.S. and either individually or working with partners, to remove people like Assad or other dictators in other nations as it deems that their position of being in power stands in the way of defeating ISIL?
