    Mr. Neugebauer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Zywicki, you spent quite a bit of your time on your academic research on consumer credit issues, and I have a bill, H.R. 1266, which would take the CFPB from a single director to a five-person commission, which I think would make that a more stable and sustainable organization. Could you elaborate on how that would help make it a more consistent and stable organization, if it was a five-person commission?    Mr. Neugebauer. Well, the--    Mr. Neugebauer. Yes. And I think when we--the purpose of this hearing is to talk about, are we more stable. And one of the things that when you look at consumer credit, that, how you design consumer credit or restrict or enhance consumer credit has long-term replications, doesn't it, for the economy in the long term?    Mr. Neugebauer. Mr. Atkins, you served on the SEC, which is a commission. Did you find that was a productive organizational structure?    Mr. Neugebauer. In that interaction with really, and sometimes different political viewpoints, different opinions, you didn't always get things the way you wanted, it looks like it promoted dialogue and some negotiation, whereas in the current structure there is no negotiation.    Mr. Neugebauer. Mr. Silvers, is the AFL-CIO governed by an executive committee?    Mr. Neugebauer. But is he responsible to a board of directors?    Mr. Neugebauer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
