    Mr. Abraham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Beckham, you and I have a little commonality, being a veterinarian, and an M.D. Also, I am very interested and impressed with your knowledge on the zoonotic diseases. And as you said in your testimony that 75 percent of the emerging pathogens are probably zoonotic in nature. And my concern is on the legislative front, this large discrepancy between DHHS and the USDA as far as biodefense allocations. Why do you think they--there is that wide chasm between both agencies, because they are fighting, hopefully, the same type of entity, why the discrepancy between the USDA and the DHHS as far as funding?    Mr. Abraham. Yes.    Mr. Abraham. Well, other than a major outbreak, which----    Mr. Abraham. All right. And let me, I guess, pony on Mr. Crawford's question. As far as the individual farming entities, what they can do. Do we, as farmers and ranchers of the country, do they form cooperatives for biodefense measures? Where would you, if you could cherry-pick what you would do for our individual large and smaller farmers, ranchers----    Mr. Abraham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am out of time.    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back.    Ms. Lujan Grisham, 5 minutes.
