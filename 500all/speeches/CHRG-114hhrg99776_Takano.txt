    Mr. Takano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Following up on my colleague Representative Bonamici's comments about health literacy, Ms. Corlette, I wanted to relate some experience in my home State of California.    Covered California recently announced--Covered California is the name of our exchange--recently announced that its contract with insurers for plan years 2017 through 2019 will include expanded tools to help consumers make their choice in plans that is best for them.    Can you discuss how improving health literacy is a tool for workers to make more informed health care decisions?    Mr. Takano. This may be an obvious question, but I think it is important for us to kind of get the thinking out there for the public.    I want to ask you a follow up. How does improved health literacy help to keep costs in check?    Mr. Takano. Because people who have not been insured before really do not know the different aspects of a health care system.    Mr. Takano. They need to learn these things, these terms, co-pay, co-insurance, all new to someone who has not really been insured before.    Had we not acted and passed the ACA, do you believe premiums for workers likely would be higher than they are today if we had not acted?    Mr. Takano. One thing we know for sure is the sky did not fall, the world did not end, and we are not seeing lots of people being put out of work, lots of full-time people being moved into part-time jobs, all these claims that were made pointing to a dire disaster have not occurred.    Mr. Takano. Thank you very much, and I yield back my time.
