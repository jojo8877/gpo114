    Mr. Gowdy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, as you know, I'm not a physician, which is why I was consulting with one, and I'm not an expert in economics, like Mr. Meadows and Mr. Mulvaney, but I am trying to understand--Ms. Bresch, maybe you can help me. Walk through the different chains of delivery for name-brand drugs versus authorized generics. From the manufacturer to the patient, what is the difference in the chain of delivery?    Mr. Gowdy. Distributed.    Mr. Gowdy. Authorized generic.    Mr. Gowdy. Okay.    Mr. Gowdy. Well, that leads me to another question. I'm sure there's a really obvious answer, but given my background, I don't know what it would be. Why don't pharmacies just deal with the manufacturer? If a doctor has to write a prescription and a pharmacist knows what the prescription is for, why is there a middle person in the delivery of drugs?    Mr. Gowdy. I guess that's my point. If you can do it for generics and authorized generics, why not for name brands too?    Mr. Gowdy. A drug middleman serves as an administrator?    Mr. Gowdy. Well, let me ask you this: Is it theoretically possible that your profit margin could increase with an authorized generic as opposed to the name-brand drug?    Mr. Gowdy. Walk me through how that would be. You're cutting out the middleman, but yet you're making less money. How?    Mr. Gowdy. I think you answered this question, but I want you to do it again for me, just because it's important. I want this to be on the record. Tell me what your--walk me through the cost all the way down to what Mylan gets for treating it as a name brand versus treating it as an authorized generic.    Mr. Gowdy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Gowdy. I will be thrilled to yield to the gentleman from Maryland.
