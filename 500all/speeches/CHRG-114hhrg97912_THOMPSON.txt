    Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. Chairman, thank you for this hearing. It's very important.    To all the members of the panel, thank you very much for coming, lending your experience, your expertise. I want to start out with Mr. Mulligan.    In SNAP, we expected the program rules to increase with the recession. They did, rising by 81 percent since 2007 before finally peaking in 2013. Since that peak, we have only seen a decline of 3 percent. Can you talk more about what that data says about the situation, or are you at all surprised?    Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you.    Mr. THOMPSON. I want to talk a little bit about within the process of the resources that are out there, because we talk about obviously, providing incentives, job training. I co-chair with a good friend of mine from Rhode Island, Jim Langevin, Career and Educational caucus. And so I want to talk about not so much a process, but the pathway in terms of job training. And we are preparing an education and workforce with the Perkins Act, which is all about job training, career and tech ed funding. And I am not sure I am going to have time to get input from someone, but if you have thoughts, I would appreciate you sending those to me in writing.    So my question is I am looking for that response from, in your experiences, what are the key considerations to assure access to effective job training? In other words, job training that actually leads to a job, family-sustaining job and a greater--and a greater opportunity, put folks on that pathway? I do believe that our programs that we have, our safety net programs, SNAP, welfare--the other welfare programs, I think they really need to be defined by--as workforce development.    Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you.
