    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to put my statement into the record, and I can go straight to questions.    Mr. Roy, I have some questions, and I have to admit, coming from Texas and refining and oil, we normally don't agree with the NRDC. But today that is a different case. Does NRDC have a sense of why new efficiency standards were proposed by DOE?    Mr. Green. I was just going to say.    Mr. Green. In 1987?    Mr. Green. We would hope the technology has changed since then.    Mr. Green. Your thoughts on the DOE proposed waiter authority for water heaters. Is that something you all support?    Mr. Green. OK. Mr. Koep, on your position as National Utility Sales Manager, can you describe what the U.S. water heater market looks like? For example, coming from Texas, we don't mind--how many natural gas versus electric water heaters are sold. Have we seen it in the last few years particularly with the cost of natural gas cheaper?    Mr. Green. Pipelines are available and everything else.    Mr. Green. OK. What is the standard size for a home now? Because I know I have heard over the years our homes have gotten so much bigger compared to the last generation. What is the standard size of a water heater now?    Mr. Green. Yes. What are the market share for new technologies like the tankless and heat pump water heaters, the pump heaters?    Mr. Green. When they need it, yes. OK. Given that the DOE standards take effect next month, have the supply chains for larger water heaters closed down or do you think that it -- because sometimes when the standards change, the supply is not there because plants haven't been doing it. Do you think there is enough supply to match what the DOE is doing?    Mr. Green. OK. I know I am over time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
