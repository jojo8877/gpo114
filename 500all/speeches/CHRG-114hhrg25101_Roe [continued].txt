    Mr. Roe . --just tell you the real-world implications of that. Okay? I have a friend of mine who retired from his dental practice because there is always not enough dentists at a VA. He sees just VA patients. That very thing has happened where he works, so he doesn't get paid.    So he is going to have to close his dental practice because of what you guys are doing to pay claims somewhere else. And that means that veterans in a facility close to where I live are not going to get dental care.    I yield back my time.
