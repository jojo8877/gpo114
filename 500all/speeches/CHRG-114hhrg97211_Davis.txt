    Mrs. Davis. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Appreciate you all being here.    One of things that you talked about just a few minutes ago was sort of that back and forth with industry and the ability of instructors, teachers to really get a sense of what's going on in the real world and be able to translate that for their students.    I wanted to ask you, though, about the curriculum for CTE teachers themselves. You were just talking a little about that. You have to know your--if you're teaching a craft, you sure as heck want to know how to do that. But are there some other attributes and ways of training for--I think, Dr. Johnson, you talked about citizenship ready skills.    What is it that perhaps within this range of classes is really required of the instructors themselves, the kind of role model that those individuals are? What have you seen that perhaps is different, you know, from an English teacher, from a history teacher?    Mrs. Davis. These are sometimes very diverse populations that people are teaching, perhaps not the way that they grew up necessarily. And so how is that inculcated? I mean, we talk about cultural competency, of course. But what is it that may be important even in terms of how we engage, recruit individuals as well within these fields? I mean, is that working? Are we seeing the diversity that we should have?    Mrs. Davis. Yeah. Dr. Major.
