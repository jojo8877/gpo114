    Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here.    We are moving toward the fifth anniversary of the passage of Dodd-Frank. Many of us were here during those turbulent and troublesome days, and we know that great care was taken in dealing with the creation of this Act. And we think that we made significant progress. And I think you, apparently, agree with us as well, that we have made tremendous progress. And regulators have moved toward implementation. Some of the rulemaking I agree with, some of it I, along with my colleagues, have challenged. But overall, we have made great progress.    But when you think about Dodd-Frank as a whole, what do you think is the most significant thing left undone? What would you want to see right now completed so that we would have the full strength of Dodd-Frank at work preventing another collapse?    Mr. Cleaver. Yes.    Mr. Cleaver. Mel Watt, who was a member of this committee--you mentioned the GSE reform and Mel Watt, of course, is now over at FHFA and doing a great job. Some of the work he is doing is going to help in some of the housing needs we have with money put into the Housing Trust Fund. But one of the things that you might be able to help me with is what do we do to enable private money to move back into the market?    Mr. Cleaver. Yes.    Mr. Cleaver. But you do believe that there is a need for a secondary market?    Mr. Cleaver. You do believe that we do need a secondary--    Mr. Cleaver. So the GSEs would be a hybrid?    Mr. Cleaver. I think in this committee there is some suggestion from time to time that the GSEs are not even needed.    And one of the things that I am wondering about, when some prefer that it be completely private, is whether you believe the private market has an appetite to fully either take over or, what I would prefer, reenter the market.
