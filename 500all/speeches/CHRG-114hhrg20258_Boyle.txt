    Mr. Boyle. Yes, thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking Member.    I wanted to ask you about two different issues, although you will I think pretty easily see the connection where I am going in a second.    The first is regarding the youth unemployment rate, which figures for 2015 show was estimated at 30 percent, remarkably high.    I was wondering to the extent that we know what is Tunisia doing right now to tackle this real problem?    Mr. Boyle. Well, the second question I am going to ask seem to be a natural flow is according to the U.N., and if you disagree with this, please let me know, but according to the U.N., there are currently 4,000 Tunisians fighting in Syria and about 1,500 fighting in Libya.    So I want to know what we believe the Tunisian Government is doing to champ down on this and extremism? And, of course, we see the connection between a country with a 30-percent youth unemployment rate and then also the problem of extremism in this region.    Mr. Boyle. I will just say finally I get the impression, and correct me if I am wrong, but it seems as if you are both on the more optimistic realm of the spectrum if I were to characterize your comments. Would that be fair in terms of what the Tunisian Government is doing right now in the steps that they are taking?    Mr. Boyle. Thank you.
