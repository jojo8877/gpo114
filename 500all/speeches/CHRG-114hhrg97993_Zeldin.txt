    Mr. Zeldin. Mr. Abraham, I look forward to serving with you and Ms. Titus.    It is an important subcommittee. I represent the 1st Congressional District of New York. Suffolk County has the highest veterans population of any county in New York State, the second-highest population of any county in the country. We are served by the VA in Northport.    I was serving in the State Senate previously, and we received a lot of outreach from people who were so frustrated with the backlog of the Federal system. They were reaching out to their State Senator, their councilmen, their county legislator, whoever could possibly help them. I am honored to serve on this committee and this subcommittee, and I appreciate you being here and anything that you can possibly do to help reduce that backlog. My office, we are looking to be partners with you with the challenges that you face.    And thanks again for yielding.
