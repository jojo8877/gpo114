    Mr. Johnson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kennedy, as you know, the law governing FirstNet included a provision that would allow the States to opt out of the FirstNet network and deploy their own network, then connect to FirstNet. So I have got a few questions about how this opt out process will work, particularly given that the region of the Nation, the region of the State that I represent is very rural. So I have some questions.    Given the projected release of the FirstNet request for proposal at the end of 2015, or the beginning of 2016, what is the likely timeline for Governors to make their decisions as to whether their States will opt out, or in, to FirstNet?    Mr. Johnson. OK, all right. Will the Governors have all of the data points, such as specific cost per user, available to them in time for them to make an informed decision to opt in or opt out, and what are your plans to communicate the kind of information that the Governors will need to make that decision?    Mr. Johnson. Um-hum.    Mr. Johnson. Um-hum.    Mr. Johnson. Well, let us say a State opts out. Are there revenues, and if so, what type of revenues might be available to them to help support their end of the network?    Mr. Johnson. OK, great. Mr. Davis, you state that FirstNet has made significant progress in communicating with you on concerns that are being raised. So, as we get closer and closer to the endgame here, to the expected final RFP, do you have any specific recommendations on how we can improve this communicating process?    Mr. Johnson. Um-hum.    Mr. Johnson. In 10 seconds let me ask you one final question. So who are the current users of the Ohio land mobile radio system, and once deployed, do you envision the public safety broadband network in Ohio to have a similar user base? And if so, why or why not?    Mr. Johnson. OK. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
