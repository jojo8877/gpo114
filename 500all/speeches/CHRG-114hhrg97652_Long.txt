    Mr. Long. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kennedy, it appears that, in many rural areas, first responders will have to rely on roaming with existing rural wireless providers for network coverage, instead of using the national public safety broadband network. How and when are you planning to address roaming coverage?    Mr. Long. Any speculation on how long that building would take, the----    Mr. Long. OK. FirstNet's partners are allowed to use the excess capacity on the FirstNet network to offer wireless services to commercial subscribers. How will FirstNet ensure its partners do not compete against existing commercial networks, particularly in the high cost rural areas where there population density often will not sustain more than one network to begin with?    Mr. Long. That is my next question. In terms of location, where will the service first and most likely be available, urban areas, or urban and rural, or what can we expect?    Mr. Long. And 3 years behind us, when do you thank that FirstNet will actually start providing service?    Mr. Long. So you think the--it will be up in 2018?    Mr. Long. OK. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
