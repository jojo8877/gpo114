    Mr. Messer. Thank you, Chairman. Fascinating conversation today. You know, as we look at how we can control costs in the world of health care, I think most of us would concede that one of the most important things we can do is turn every American who receives health care into a health care consumer, where they are actually making consumer decisions.    At the same time, Mr. Zern, as you highlighted in your testimony, you have over 150 million Americans getting employer provided health care. That is an important part of our system. You mentioned in your testimony that employers offering health care benefits are genuinely driven to promote health care awareness, reduce health care spending, ensure that employees and their families have comprehensive coverage and the like.    There has been a lot of discussion lately about the overall viability and future role of employer-based health care. I was hoping you could just highlight for the panel, how do consumers behave differently when coverage is provided by their employer versus when they purchase health insurance on their own?    Mr. Messer. Following up on that, what are some of the obstacles preventing employers from signing up for private exchanges that you can identify?    Mr. Messer. I might open it to both Mr. Zern and others on the panel, we are here obviously today in Congress, what could Congress do to enhance the opportunities or to eliminate barriers for employers to be engaged in private exchanges?    Mr. Messer. I presume part of your point there is when it gets so complicated, the individual employer just throws up their hands and decides to--    Mr. Messer. Yes. Anybody else?    Okay. Thank you. I yield back the balance of my time, Chairman.
