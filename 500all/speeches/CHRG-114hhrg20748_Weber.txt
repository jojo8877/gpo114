    Mr. Weber. I am good and I am ready to go. Thank you.    Mr. Weber. Will the gentleman yield the rest of his time?    Mr. Weber . Mr. DeSantis, if you are ready, if you are in a hurry, I will yield to you for 5 minutes.    Mr. Weber. I thank the gentleman.    The gentlelady from Florida is recognized.    Mr. Weber. All right. Thank you.    I am sorry, Dr. Melito, did you just say that the Turkey and the Jordan military have not been very cooperative?    Mr. Weber. They have been cooperative.    Mr. Weber. Okay. I don't think your button is on.    Mr. Weber. Have been. Okay.    Mr. Weber. All right. Very good.    A lot of questions. Is it Calvaresi Barr?    Mr. Weber. Calvaresi Barr?    Mr. Weber. Calvaresi Barr. Okay.    Mr. Weber. I can do this.    You said earlier, I think, that there were nine partners that had been either used or identified as bad players. Refresh my memory on that.    Mr. Weber. Implementers.    Mr. Weber. In what period of time? Is that the last year?    Mr. Weber. So the last not quite 2----    Mr. Weber. I got you. And when aid is delivered, do you have evidence that it was delivered?    Mr. Weber. Well, they can put chips in animals, right, that can be tracked? So if you put one on just every 50th, you know, item or so?    Mr. Weber. Has that been looked at?    Mr. Weber. So if you lose an implementer, do you have a ready supply of people lined up on the list that are applying to be implementers?    Mr. Weber. It makes me wonder if there is not a preferred implementer that actually--this is probably not the right term--but gets a kickback or is a favorite. They get a pass, they get to come on deep into Syria with the least amount of hassle. Has that been your findings or no? Are there preferred implementers, one does a better job than the other?    Mr. Weber. So that they all get treated--I guess I am asking, are they bipartisan, is what I am asking? They all get treated the same.    Mr. Weber. Okay. Good. And has there ever been an instance where there is a recovery of any aid? Aid gets lost, gets taken, and once that happens, it is done.    Mr. Weber. Were there criminal charges that ensued in that instance?    Mr. Weber. Okay. And then, Dr. Melito, I think you said some aid workers were killed, and I didn't quite hear what you said. Did you say eight or nine or 89?    Mr. Weber. Eighty-nine. Okay. Okay. And then furthermore, Turkey and Jordan were the two areas that the aid came out of, but did you say that they really didn't--that the Assad regime really doesn't prefer that?    Mr. Weber. So is it because Turkey and Jordan signed onto the resolution?    Mr. Weber. So would Assad rather they come from Russia, from Iran, from Iraq? Where would he rather they come from?    Mr. Weber. His areas of control, so he can parlay out the goods----    Mr. Weber . However he wants to. Well, that makes sense, I guess, if you are Assad.    Okay. And then finally, your office hasn't yet conducted audits of USAID programs in Syria. Is that right?    Mr. Weber. Well, that is encouraging to hear. So you will have a plan put together and we will see you back next week?    Mr. Weber. All right. Well, my time has expired. I am going to yield back.    Ted, any more questions?    Mr. Weber. All right. This hearing is concluded. Thank you very much.
