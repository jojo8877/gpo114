    Mrs. Lawrence. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I understand that part of the application process, there is numerous conversations typically occur between the applicant and the FDIC before a formal application is filed. Chairman Gruenberg, what types of conversations occur?    Mrs. Lawrence. Is this before--is this an interest in an application or there is an official application filed and then you start having these pre-conversations?    Mrs. Lawrence. Mr. Browning, you have had some concerns. Would you say this has been your reality?    Mrs. Lawrence. Okay.    Mrs. Lawrence. So if I could try to interpret your comments. There were conversations, but you felt that they were not productive and the type----    Mr. Chairman, you've heard that comment. Do additional discussions occur between the applicant and the FDIC, after the application is filed, and where do you think the breakdown is, at least for Mr. Browning?    Mrs. Lawrence. You need to turn on your mike.    Mrs. Lawrence. Yeah.    Mrs. Lawrence. Mr. Chairman, can you tell me what have you done? What can you state that you've done to welcome new applicants?    Mrs. Lawrence. Chairman, I just want to say, on the record, I would like to hear this from you. Do you identify that there has been a high rate of denials of new applications and that you are implementing new practices, or are you stating that the history of the applicants not being approved had nothing to do with your process?    Mrs. Lawrence. Yes, I understand.    Mrs. Lawrence. Okay.    Mrs. Lawrence. So are you doing new innovative things recognizing that has happened?    Mrs. Lawrence. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
