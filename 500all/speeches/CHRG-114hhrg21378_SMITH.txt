    Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, Mr. Goss, for your presence here today.    I think it is important to note that the longer we wait to make changes, the more difficult it will get.    But just to clarify, you just said that Social Security is not fully funded, and yet, we heard earlier and there was a graph up there that suggests that there is a surplus. I mean, that to me doesn't level. Would you characterize that as a surplus?    Mr. SMITH. Would you call that a surplus, given the suggestion of obligation for a 4-year degree?    Mr. SMITH. But perhaps a better approach would be to suggest that it is not fully funded, as I heard from you?    Mr. SMITH. All right. Okay.    Now, is there any way to quantify, perhaps, that delaying a decision, that the cost of delay is X? I mean, have you sorted that out? Is there a way to really quantify that?    Because when I talk to especially younger folks who are paying in to Social Security and when we tell them that those dollars won't be there long term if no changes are made, is there any way to quantify that?    Mr. SMITH. On the continuum of time, the longer we wait, I mean, it only gets worse.    Mr. SMITH. Sure. And I can appreciate that.    Now, previous messages from Public Trustees have noted that even if not a single dollar were paid to new beneficiaries once the trust funds are exhausted, there still wouldn't be enough money to pay benefits for those already receiving them. Is that still true?    Mr. SMITH. But it helps us reflect kind of the obligations that are there. And I think it is very advisable for us, on both sides of the aisle, to acknowledge the realities that are out there.    I mean, I cannot suggest that there is a surplus, given all of the obligations long term. And believe me, we need to think longer term about especially this issue, given what has been promised over the past and hopefully will in the future.    Thank you, I yield back.
