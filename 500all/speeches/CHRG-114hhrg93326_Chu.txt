    Ms. CHU. Well, this question is for anybody on the panel, and it has to do with reverse auctions. You have all been pretty vociferous in being against reverse actions for the construction industry, and you have said that it does not guarantee the lowest price, may encourage imprudent bidding, does not allow for a thorough evaluation of value, and does not ensure that the successful bidder is responsive and responsible and may, in fact, go against federal procurement laws. And in fact, the Army Corps of Engineers study found that it did not even offer marginal savings over a sealed bid process. I find that very interesting because the reason for reverse auctions in the first place was to get to the lowest price. So I would like your comments on any of these factors that have come out because of the reverse auctions.    Ms. CHU. If I may change topics, Mr. Gibson, the SBA has two surety bond guarantee programs that guarantee 70 to 90 percent of the bonds up to $6.5 million in value to assist small businesses. However, many construction companies are not using the program and the individual sureties have filled the void. Why do you believe construction companies are not utilizing the program, and what are the steps that could make this program more attractive? Like, for instance, if they were guaranteed by 100 percent or if the total guaranteed value is increased from $6.5 million?    Ms. CHU. Okay. Anybody else on the panel?
