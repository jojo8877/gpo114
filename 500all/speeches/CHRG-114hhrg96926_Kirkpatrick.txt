    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My first question is for Mr. Hanson.    In your statement you disagree with the FAA regarding the number of UAS near-miss reports with the FAA, that are received by the FAA. Does AMA have a data collection and analysis program underway to collect near-miss reports from UAS users or airline pilots? And how does AMA substantiate your statement, that the number of reports are actually much lower?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Do you have a suggestion for a definition of ``near miss,'' then, that should be standardized?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. I would agree with you. If we are going to develop some commonsense policy out of this committee, we need to have good data upon which to do that. So thank you for your suggestion.    My next question is for Mr. Hubbard. Mr. Hubbard, I represent one of the most forested districts in the country, although it is in Arizona. People don't think of Arizona as having that much forest.    I am sure you are very familiar with the horrific wildfires we have, and we are really trying to do something with prevention. And so my question is a little bit different from just suppression. You know, how--what is the opportunity to use drones in fire prevention, and in healthy forests?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. And then, specifically, back to suppression, how do you intend to use UAS in fire suppression efforts?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. You know, we had a tragic situation with the Yarnell fire, where our firefighting crew did not know the direction of that fire, and it changed dramatically from what was being expected. Would UAS have been helpful to prevent that tragedy?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you. I yield back.
