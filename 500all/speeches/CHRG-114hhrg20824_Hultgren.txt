    Mr. Hultgren. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you all so much for being here for this important discussion. I do believe this is an important hearing.    And as technology continues to evolve and new opportunities materialize, it's increasingly necessary that we keep our regulatory structure up-to-date while developing biotechnology in the most ethical way possible. This means coordination and communication between our researchers, their institutions, our government, and also among government agencies.    Dr. Maxon, I wonder if I could address my first couple questions to you. You mentioned the Human Genome Project in your testimony, which for me has been an excellent example of the unique capabilities of the Department of Energy to bring to the table in computing, among other things. DOE basically had to start the project to prove the concept before NIH was able to take this up as a serious cost-effective endeavor. How has the Human Genome Project benefited the nonhuman health biotech sectors? And also, is there a similar systematic sequencing project needed for agriculture or naturally occurring chemicals as well?    Mr. Hultgren. Yes, I'm sorry.    Mr. Hultgren. Yes, the second question was, you know, as far as agriculture or other naturally occurring chemicals is there a similar systematic sequencing project that we need or where we should focus?    Mr. Hultgren. Does anybody else have a--yes.    Mr. Hultgren. That's great. Thank you. I'm going to go back to Dr. Maxon if that's all right. From your time at OSTP and now with the lab, surely you've seen the difficulties of getting agencies to work together, especially in getting them to leverage one another's resources, tools, and human expertise. It sounds to me like there is great potential if agencies would work more closely together in this space, for instance, if ag aggressively leveraged the synthetic biology and genomic capabilities of the national labs. I wonder, will this work and what do you suggest? How do we--from your experience, how do we best work together?    Mr. Hultgren. Great. My time is almost expired. I will yield back my last 7 seconds. Thank you.    Chairwoman Comstock. And I now recognize Mr. Weber for five minutes.
