    Mr. Marino. Thank you, chairman.    Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary.    Mr. Secretary, I want to talk about Yemen for a moment. Since 2006, we have given them about $500 million in military assistance. Now, since we have had the overthrow that we have seen, there is money slated for Yemen. I am just going to make an assumption here that that is not going to happen, given the circumstances there, but can you address the issue as to what you--what we know about the weapons--the U.S. weapons that were there? Where are they? Who has them? Would you comment on that, please?    Mr. Marino. Was part of that--were the weapons instructed to be handed over to the--those that overthrew the government or is that----    Mr. Marino . Just a media fictitious statement.    Mr. Marino. Mr. Secretary, I have 1 minute left.    Mr. Marino. Okay.    Mr. Marino. All right. The President stated that Yemen was a success, was an example of--quintessential example of success and what we have accomplished. What did we miss? How did we go from this is an example of the success that we are fighting terrorism to being overthrown just like that and run out of the country?
