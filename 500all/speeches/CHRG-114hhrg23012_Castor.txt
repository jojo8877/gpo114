    Ms. Castor. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to our witnesses for being here today.    GAO made six recommendations in its August 2016 report to reduce the risk of incidents involving incomplete inactivation of dangerous pathogens. I would like to hear from each of the agencies on your reaction to GAO's recommendations and the length of time you believe it will take you to implement them.    First, GAO suggested that to increase the scientific information on inactivation and viability testing, the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture should coordinate research efforts. This will help close gaps in the science of inactivation across high containment laboratories.    So I would like to ask CDC and NIH, APHIS and DoD, at this point what are the specific scientific gaps that need to be addressed, in other words what is still unknown about the science of inactivation and what is the significance of that lack of knowledge, and what will be involved in closing these gaps? When do you believe this recommendation could be substantially achieved?    Why don't we start on this side with CDC.    Ms. Castor. Terrific.    Dr. Persons, it would appear that before implementing some of your other recommendations, such as the creation of a comprehensive and consistent guidance on inactivation protocols, the agencies must first increase their scientific understanding on inactivation and close the gaps that we have been discussing and they have identified. Would you agree, are you hopeful this can be done in a timely way, and will GAO monitor these agencies for progress in closing the scientific gaps?    Dr. Persons. So thank you for the question, Ms. Castor. Yes, we believe it's possible. We do believe that extensive coordination is necessary, and it sounds from the witnesses' statements today that's begun. And yes, GAO will keep an eye on this moving forward for this committee.    Ms. Castor. Thank you very much.
