    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you, Madam Chair.    And thank you for your presentations today and my compliments to you on the work you're doing. It's very sophisticated and it seems that it has tremendous potential for good.    On the area of ethics of this I wanted to just explore a few different areas. Dr. Khan, I wanted to start with you. When you're advising on the ethics of a new genetic technology, are there certain ethical lines that should never be crossed, and if so, how are those lines drawn?    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you.    And then, Dr. Doudna, you're one of the new developers of this new technology, and what was it that first sparked your concern over the ethics of its use, whether it was in China or when did you start being concerned about that?    Mr. Moolenaar. And what role does--you know, I guess one of the things that occur to me is the whole area of consent. What role does that play in this process when someone is giving consent or not?    Mr. Moolenaar. Yeah--actually, all four.    Mr. Moolenaar. Yeah. Thank you.    Mr. Moolenaar. I would agree with that. Thank you.    Chairwoman Comstock. Thank you.    And now I recognize Mr. Tonko for five minutes.    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you. I now recognize Dr. Abraham.    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you.    I now recognize Mr. Sherman.    Mr. Moolenaar. The gentleman's time is--    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you.    Ms. Bonamici.    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you.
