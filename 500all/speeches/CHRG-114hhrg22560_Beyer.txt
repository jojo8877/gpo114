    Mr. Beyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Becker, I think in your comments you stated and wrote that there are 20 States in this Electronic Registration Information Center that you helped found. Why not 30? And then how do we motivate the other 30 to be part of it? And is there any suggestion that we'd ever require that?    Mr. Beyer. Great. A parallel question for Dr. Wallach. In Mr. Becker's testimony, he talked about how the postelection audit requirement that mandates States match paper to digital is only 32 States doing this right now. And you wrote the mere possibility of a recount or audit of the paper ballots acts as a deterrent, dot, dot, dot. So what do we need to do with the other 18 States that don't have this post-audit reconciliation of paper and electronic?    Mr. Beyer. There was the mention that we have $396 million of authorized but un-appropriated HAVA money. Is that enough to replace the old machines, the bad machines?    Mr. Beyer. Thanks. Many of you wrote about how the machines aren't connected to the Internet. So, Secretary Schedler, if they're not connected to the Internet yet, Dr. Wallach pointed out that they are at the time of initialization and tabulation. I think someone else pointed out that they're usually connected to the voter databases, you know, 365 days a year. So how--is that actually a strength that we can talk about that we're not connected to the Internet, or are those holes at initialization and tabulation----    Mr. Beyer. Great. Great. Thank you, Secretary.    Dr. Romine, a quick question. On this postelection audit requirement of reconciling paper and digital is--will--is this a NIST suggestion or a NIST standard or should it be?    Mr. Beyer. Okay. Thank you very much. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
