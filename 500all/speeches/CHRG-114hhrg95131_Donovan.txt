    Mr. Donovan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    That is the chairman's way of telling me be very brief. As my friend from Florida just said, there are people like Joanne Chesimard, who have escaped the justice system of our United States after killing a New Jersey State trooper, and we are not demanding her return before we negotiate. And the poor people of Cuba whose human rights are still being violated; we are not asking for anything in exchange. It seems like the regime is making all of the demands on our country.    So I just wanted to thank you first for coming here and addressing this important issue for the Cuban people, the residents there, and ask if you think there is anything else. I mean, you are well aware of what Congress is doing to try to rectify this wrong. Is there anything else that in your opinion should be done by this legislative body that will help this process along?    Mr. Donovan. Thank you.    Mr. Donovan. Yes.
