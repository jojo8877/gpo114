    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Abizaid--I am sorry--the report that was released today by SIGAR points to many issues about contractor performance in Afghanistan. And would you agree that the poor contractor performance has hindered the Department of Defense's rebuilding efforts?    Mr. Carter. Okay. Let me ask you something. On these projects, are there any provisions in your reconstruction contracts that require the contractor to complete the project before they are paid?    Mr. Carter. Sure. Sure.    Mr. Carter. So it is not the ----    Mr. Carter. Do you ever hold back any in anticipation of, you know, you have got to complete this project, not this portion of the project but this project has got to be completed before you get the last check?    Mr. Carter. And I am understanding of that and I am appreciative of that, but at the same time, this is interfering with the Department of Defense's rebuilding efforts. I mean, that has been acknowledged. We have got to do something. I mean, you know, we are getting reports that we are continuing to contract with firms that aren't finishing the work.    Mr. Carter. Okay. Mr. Sopko, let me ask you. Let me ask you your opinion of the oversight that the Department of Defense does on these projects. Do you think that it is adequate?    Mr. Carter. Yet they are continuing to pay them?    Mr. Carter. Okay. You all have got me confused here. Okay. I have got somebody telling me, yes, we were doing good and we are doing better and then I got somebody else telling me, no ----    Mr. Carter. Okay. I am sorry to interrupt you but I want to get back to Mr. Sopko. I have got a report that the Ministry of Defense building took 5 years, 5--1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years times the original budget to complete, yet it is still not fully complete. Is that true? Mr. Sopko, is that ----    Mr. Carter. Five years?    Mr. Carter. But I am correct, 5 years?    Mr. Carter. Is that acceptable?    Mr. Carter. Then what can we do to make it--what can we do to improve? I mean--and out of all due respect, I don't need to hear just, oh, it is security concerns.    Mr. Carter. You know, maybe what we ought to do is just get some helicopters and get money and just, you know, drop it over the country. I mean, seriously. This is totally unacceptable.    Mr. Carter. Mr. Sopko, thank you, but I will be quite honest with you, I could have gone all day without hearing this. This is really disappointing.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your indulgence.    Mr. Carter. Yes. Absolutely.
