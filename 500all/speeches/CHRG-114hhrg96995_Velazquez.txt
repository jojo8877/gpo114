    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, we have held a number of cybersecurity hearings this year both in this committee and in the Small Business Committee to examine the toll of cyber attacks on consumers and businesses. Many of the witnesses stated that a clear, uniform set of rules was needed to address this problem.    Can you elaborate on FSOC's proposal for a national plan to respond to cyber threats that you mentioned in your testimony?    Ms. Velazquez. Right.    Ms. Velazquez. The cost is an issue, especially for small businesses. Do you have any type of interagency working relationship on this matter like the Small Business Administration (SBA)?    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.    As you mentioned, lending standards have decreased as financial institutions try to find profitability in the current low-interest-rate environment. While the loosening of credit markets since the recession is beneficial for small businesses, too much risk-taking could again lead to problems.    If interest rates were to rise, what impact will this have on the markets overall and specifically on access to capital for small businesses?    Ms. Velazquez. Sure.    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.
