    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I am making history today. I have located myself in a bipartisan position.    Mr. Green. With your consent and permission, may I stay, or do I need to go over and find my nameplate across the room? Am I okay?    Mr. Green. I am very comfortable.    Mr. Green. Thank you very much. And I thank the witnesses and the ranking member as well, Mr. Chairman. I regret my being tardy, but I did have another event that necessitated my attention with the Secretary of Labor and it took a little longer than we thought it would.    I am one who probably does not represent what would be styled a rural area in the United States of America. Houston, Texas, for the most part is what I represent, and a couple of other smaller cities. But I am very much concerned about people. This is my country. I love my country.    And I think these programs that we are discussing are programs that have been implemented to be of help to people. They did not occur haphazardly, capriciously, and arbitrarily. They were thoughtful programs and I think that they still have some meaningful rewards that we can reap from them.    But I do understand that we have had some level of improper payments with RHS. And my concern has more to do with what corrective measures can we take, as opposed to whether we should eliminate programs. I have found that acquiring these programs is much harder than eliminating them. Once they are gone, they are gone forever for the most part. So would you kindly give me a response?    Mr. Green. Have you requested elimination as a solution?    Mr. Green. Elimination of a program.    Mr. Green. Thank you. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do want to simply say this in closing, Mr. Chairman. I don't want anyone to assume that I have realigned myself by taking a certain seat. I am still the same Al Green who arrived here in 2005.    Thank you much.
