    Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.    I want to revisit this issue of the aerostats. Can you tell me how many aerostats you have in--that are deployed at present?    Mr. Rogers. Are they the same model or version or do they differ?    Mr. Rogers. What do you mean supported by mobile towers? I see the tower on the truck here. Does that have to go somewhere closer to the aerostats?    Mr. Rogers. They receive signals from the aerostat?    Mr. Rogers. So it doesn't go to the truck that is carrying the tower?    Mr. Rogers. Are all 6 of the aerostats deployed at present?    Mr. Rogers. How long do they stay up?    Mr. Rogers. Are you keeping these in a particular sector?    Mr. Rogers. Are all 6 of these from the DOD?    Mr. Rogers. Are there any remaining DOD aerostats available that you have not accepted?    Mr. Rogers. Do you have a need for more than the 6?    Mr. Rogers. Why?    Mr. Rogers. Why?    Mr. Rogers. All of these are tethered, correct?    Mr. Rogers. At what altitude?    Mr. Rogers. Have you all considered using some of the non-tethered aerostats, then they can loiter for a longer periods of time?    Mr. Rogers. Correct. The Marines use those?    Mr. Rogers. One of the reasons I am so focused on these, is in my trips to the Southwest Border, we have had just a world of trouble with cameras, whether cameras on poles or trucks or whatever. To my knowledge, those problems still exist. Also, I like the fact that they are up high, and you can see further across the border where there is people gathering.    So I am just curious, and this would be my final question, I know my time has expired: What is the downside?    Mr. Rogers. I won't ask any more questions, but I would, Madam Chairwoman, like to, at some point, revisit the idea of micro sats to see if they are using any of those.    With that, I yield back.
