    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Ms. Saldana, would you say what you wanted to say?    Ms. Kelly. Thank you.    Mr. Roth, I have reviewed your report from last month on the Department's need to strengthen data collection for its enforcement efforts. I think we all agree that, ideally, DHS would always be collecting more, not less, data. I would like to explore how this can best be done when resources may already be stretched thin. Last November, the Department's memo on exercising prosecutorial discretion stated, ``It is generally preferable to exercise such discretion as early in the case or proceeding as possible in order to preserve government resources.''    Director, do you agree with that?    Ms. Kelly. And can you explain specifically how the use of prosecutorial discretion helps preserve ICE's resources?    Ms. Kelly. And how frequently would you say a typical ICE agent exercises this discretion on the job?    Ms. Kelly. Thank you.    Mr. Roth, in your written testimony, you said: Given the shear number of removable aliens and the finite resources available to remove them, DHS has decided it must focus on those who pose the greatest risk.    As a former prosecutor, you used prosecutorial discretion many times, isn't that right?    Ms. Kelly. Would you agree that this discretion involves making judgment calls?    Ms. Kelly. And, Mr. Roth, in writing the May 4 report, did your office conduct a cost-benefit analysis as to how more discretion data would improve enforcement outcomes, and why or why not?    Ms. Kelly. So DHS responded to a draft of the inspector general's report by stating this data project will, ``provide a framework for measuring and evaluating the Department's enforcement actions from a range of perspectives.''    Is it fair to say that sometimes the use of this discretion can be difficult to quantify?    Ms. Kelly. I'm out of time. Thank you so much.
