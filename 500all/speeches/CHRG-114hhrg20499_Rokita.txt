    Mr. Rokita. I thank the chairman. And Ms. Bristol, so the military training program doesn't suffice? Military controllers can't pass your processes and cannot work in the civil----    Mr. Rokita. All right.    Mr. Rokita. Well, why can't--why do they fail?    Mr. Rokita. So you agree to correct the flaws?    Mr. Rokita. Mr. Rinaldi--thank you--do you have a comment on this?    Mr. Rokita. Roger, thank you.    Continuing on with the CTI schools, Mr. Cannon, can you explain why the FAA decided to use a BA, bachelor of arts, for general public candidates, including graduates of CTI schools? And second, can you explain why the FAA modified the BA so quickly?    Mr. Rokita. Yes.    Mr. Rokita. Why did you use the same contractor for the biographical analysis?    Mr. Rokita. Yes, when the--that contractor failed the first time.    Mr. Rokita. Failed to do the job correctly the first time.    Mr. Rokita. Mr. Rinaldi, is that your opinion?    Mr. Rokita. Thank you very much for that testimony.    Ms. Bristol, Purdue University in my district is one of the 36 schools approved to participate in the Collegiate Training Initiative. When the hiring process was changed, CTI students no longer received a bonus on their application, whatever that looks like, for completing the program.    Why do you think that is right, that is the right decision, not to give priority to these students who were specifically trained to do air traffic control at what--you know, unless you are a hard IU fan, wouldn't agree that Purdue is not a good place to get that kind of work done, that kind of training done?    Mr. Rokita. Well, there is a----    Mr. Rokita. There is a shortage, sir. Why not--you have these people trained already. Why not get them to the front of the line and get them in a tower, or get them in a TRACON?    Mr. Rokita. I don't get it.    Mr. Rokita. I thank the chairman for his time. I yield back. Apparently we don't need to have this hearing, Chairman.
