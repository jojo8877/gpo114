    Mr. Crowley. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member. I appreciate the invitation to be here today and your recognition of the importance of marine safety throughout our maritime transportation chain. I represent the marine terminal operator and stevedoring industry. I, from a visual standpoint, look at them as that engine within the fence in our ports that make the economy work, that make the intermodal transfer work safely, productively for our businesses, exports and imports.    Despite being a volume-based, cycle-time industry, safety is always job one for industry members. Safety, it comes in many forms. But for today's purpose we are looking at container weights. Containers originate from all over the world. They are carried by multiple flag vessels. They arrive at marine terminals, both here and abroad. The importance of having a consistent safety standard is almost without question. Those safety standards the National Association of Waterfront Employers look forward to.    We look forward to the amendments to ensure that that is continued, and that the condition, the contents, and the weight processes that are available and the records provided to us are dependable for marine terminal--those inconsistencies, if they are wrong, show up immediately and have the potential of grinding operations literally to a halt.    And we look forward to increased productivity. Toward that end, our members have worked hard to reengineer their processes, including technology solutions in concordance with our customers, those that Mr. Butler represents, and provide systems that are more agile, that provide a faster, better, safer system towards the improvement of our marine cargo transportation system.    Thank you for your attention, and look forward to questions from you today.
