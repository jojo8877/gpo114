    Ms. Bass. Thank you, Chairman Smith, for your leadership and for calling today's hearing on the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, to give us an opportunity to discuss the need to examine the act toward a global vehicle to hold individuals accountable for human rights abuses.    I would also like to thank our distinguished witnesses for today, including representatives from a range of organizations concerned with global human rights issues. I look forward to hearing each of your perspectives, including your assessment of what more can be done to successfully expose and address gross violations of human rights around the world.    Dealing with issues of corruption and impunity are challenges to national governance worldwide. These challenges become particularly pronounced when governments seek to silence citizens who promote human rights or seek to expose illegal activities by those governments, be they journalists, intellectuals, or other kinds of activists and whistleblowers. To be clear, we know that this silencing takes multiple forms, including illegal detention, torture, and extrajudicial killings.    Again, I want to thank today's witnesses for their time and insight and look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to further develop legislation to address global human rights abuses and increase the accountability of governmental officials who violate citizens' human rights.    I yield back.
