    Mr. Grijalva. We are both----    Mr. Grijalva. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Very kind of you. And thank you for holding the hearing, and welcoming all the witnesses and former colleagues that are here with us today. And the sponsor of two pieces of legislation, our colleague on the committee, Mr. Pierluisi, who has worked long and hard in dealing with both the economic reality and challenges that are facing Puerto Rico now, as well as a piece of legislation that calls for a vote on the status and the statehood status--the Puerto Rico Statehood Admission Act, using the money that was appropriated previously, as the source for the election cost and the promotion of that.    The other one I think is very important, the submitted H.R. 870, because it is about equal treatment. And until the other issue, in terms of status and jurisdiction are settled, I think it is an important piece of legislation, because it talks about status. The 11 percent cut in Medicare only on the island, that is not an appropriate response to the economic crisis. Allowing Chapter 9 bankruptcy for state-owned--whether it be power or other authorities, and allowing the government-owned companies, as well as municipalities, to use Chapter 9, as would be the availability to any community or publicly-owned company here on the mainland.    So I want to thank the gentleman for that. I have a long, beautiful statement--10 pages--Mr. Chairman, that I will submit for the record.    Mr. Grijalva. Thank you.    Mr. Grijalva. I am through and I yield back. Thank you.
