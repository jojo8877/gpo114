    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to all of our witnesses for your testimony today.    General Ferrell touched on this briefly, but I wanted to ask each of you to weigh in. In your view, what are the risks and vulnerabilities to our network campaign plans, network modernization efforts, should DOD be forced to execute funding levels at BCA funding levels?    Ms. Stefanik. And could you add on also what that means for the current threat assessment, how the threats have increased over the past 5 to 10 years?    Ms. Stefanik. Would anyone else like to add?    General Bender. I will add just very briefly that I am relatively new in the position. But 5 months of discovery leaves me with a very strong impression that we are not going to harden or protect our networks to a completely safe, secure environment. It is nearly impossible because of the evolving nature of the threat.    That said we need to have, and as the other services have already mentioned, the ability to fight through a determined adversary and find our way through it. And so risk management becomes really what is key and essential to our approach going forward.    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you. I have one question on a separate topic. And this is for just my background and for everyone else on the committee.    Can you give an assessment of where other countries are in terms of their investment in network modernization efforts? Are we behind? Are we losing our edge? I know that is a very broad question, but it is an important one.    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you very much, unless anyone has anything else to add. Thank you. I yield back.
