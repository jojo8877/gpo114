    Mr. Thompson. Chairman, thank you. Thank you for members of the panel for being here on this important topic.    Let me bring our discussion right back to where it is supposed to be, on the United States Department of Education, and quite frankly, the intent of Congress. Because that is the friction point we have at this point. My question I will open-up to all.    Most of you have talked to some extent about the potential impact on special programs, things like career and technical education, magnet schools, art programs, physical education mentioned. I am sure there may be others. Be curious to hear what others you have concerns about with how the department is moving ahead contrary to the intent of Congress.    Can you explain more about why these programs will be at risk and how those programs are addressing equity concerns? Let's start with Dr. Canavero, please.    Mr. Thompson. Just to follow up on that, you mentioned the cost of career and technical education. Truly, if we are meeting market demands and we are educating, and my understanding was career and technical education, the dropout rate there is much lower than in traditional education settings, but there is a cost, if it is welding, medicine related, agriculture, machining.    If those are where the costs occur obviously with this equalization that the Department of Education is trying to pursue, essentially if you do not have state-of-the-art equipment, you are not really preparing the students with the competencies to go right into the workforce. That is my concern. Is that accurate?    Mr. Thompson. Thank you. Mr. Owens, any thoughts/impacts on the types of programs we have been reflecting on?    Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Chairman. I yield back.
