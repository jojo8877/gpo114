    Mr. Conaway. Thanks, Chairman Rouzer, and, David, thank you for those kind comments.    I just want to do a couple of things. One, congratulate you on your chairmanship, and you are chairing your very first official hearing. You bring great talent and a wealth of background and experiences to the tasks, and I have great confidence in you and Mr. Costa that you will get this done.    I also want to thank our witnesses for coming here today to help us understand some of the retaliatory impacts that may occur if we fail to act, and in fact, the WTO rules against the appeal that is out there. This debate surrounding Mandatory Country-of-Origin Labeling precedes my term in Congress, although as a freshman, one of my first Floor speeches related to agriculture was related to this topic. In spite of the reservations that cattlemen and pork producers expressed at the time this was being considered that it wouldn't work and that we would suffer consequences as a result of it. Congress decided to go ahead and try to implement it, at great costs, and in my view, unquantifiable benefits as a result of this process. In addition to that, the impact has been that our North American livestock market has been fractured unnecessarily, and again for no good reason.    So as we examine the impacts of retaliation, if we lose the appeal, I hope that the Members will also recognize the failure of this experiment, and work together to avoid the economic damages that will be felt by American businesses both inside and outside agriculture.    So with that, Mr. Chairman, good luck on your role as Chairman of this Subcommittee, and I look forward to your leadership. I yield back.
