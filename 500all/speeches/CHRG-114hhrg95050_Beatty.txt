    Mrs. Beatty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Waters.    And thank you, Mr. Cordray, for being here testifying again today. Certainly we have asked you a wide array of questions ranging from credit to payday lending, a little bit about--and the list goes on and on. And so, the good and the bad news is I am going to add to that list. But one of the things that we talked about when you were here before in the last Congress is we talked about credit reports and now, after having the opportunity to look through your document and saying on--I am going to reference, Mr. Chairman, page 28--when we look at number of complaints and the things with constituents, 76 talked about incorrect information.    And then when you look at the other pies on your chart, it made me want to ask the question because on this committee, we talk about a whole host of things and whether it is on our Housing Subcommittee, whether it is on working with banks, it all comes back to your credit and what you put into that investment in credit, if you go to purchase a home or if you are starting a business and yet we are finding out that oftentimes the information is incorrect on there. And it becomes almost impossible to the lay consumer or constituent to get that removed or get it changed.    So, you talked a lot about tools today. Can you give us any update or information on what we can say to our constituents about that?    Mrs. Beatty. Thank you. My last question is, this past week I have had a lot of--all of us have had a lot of people come in to see us over this whole issue with cyber threats. Is there any more that maybe you haven't said or that I did not hear--we had a lot of our community banks and regional bank folks come in and say that with the number of credit cards that are being compromised, and I know firsthand, because I used my credit card, went to pay the bill, and my private banker said to me oh, there is something wrong with your credit card.    Now, I was pretty sure that was inaccurate. She told me it had been compromised. And so, they cut it in two. That was the good news. My sister's was compromised that same day but someone had used hers repeatedly to the tune of thousands of dollars.    Now, the banks are telling me they are making that whole versus the Neiman Marcus or the Targets or wherever you used it get off free. Any thoughts on what we should say back to our bankers?
