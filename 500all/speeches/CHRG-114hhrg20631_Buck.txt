    Mr. Buck. I was just having fun over here listening to Mr. Gohmert. Mr. Gohmert, do you need more time?    Mr. Buck. You said you only had 5 minutes, you were going to run out of time.    Mr. Buck. All right. I have one sort of simple straightforward question, and I am directed to Mr. Eberstadt to start with. There are more than a dozen versions of a balanced budget amendment running around Congress right now. What would the effect of a balanced budget amendment be on this particular area?    Mr. Buck. Okay. I do not want to mispronounce your name.    Mr. Buck. Okay. You want to take a shot at that?    Mr. Buck. And what is the alternative?    Mr. Buck. But you know what happens then----    Mr. Buck. This Congress would blame it on the next one that it was not balanced 10 years from now. That is the game.    Mr. Buck. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Mr. Buck. I have got to yield back.
