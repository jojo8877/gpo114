    Mr. Gibbs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Admiral, not to beat the ballast water to death--the chairman did a pretty good job--that is more of where my questions are going to, since I am from Ohio and represent the Great Lakes region. And start with my understanding on the EPA, they can--States can add additional requirements onto the--wherever the rules might be. Is that true?    Mr. Gibbs. OK.    Mr. Gibbs. States can, OK.    Mr. Gibbs. Because that is a real concern if you look at how the Great Lakes region works with the Saint Lawrence Seaway and--you know, so it makes sense that--I know the Coast Guard and EPA is trying to harmonize some of these separate laws and regulations.    I think from your earlier comment you are a supporter of doing that to a single regulatory policy. And if that is the case, would the Coast Guard be the agency to perform that, then?    Mr. Gibbs. That is good clarification, and I meant to say it that way, yes.    Mr. Gibbs. But you are--support that Congress does that, because it makes for smooth interstate commerce. And especially in the Great Lakes region, it makes sense, right?    Mr. Gibbs. OK. Back on the technology, my understanding, that the International Maritime Organization, IMO, has approved UV technology, but the Coast Guard hasn't. Is that correct?    Mr. Gibbs. OK. So right now our shippers, vessel owners, are kind of just hanging in limbo because they--if they want to put in some newer technology, they don't know if it is going to get approved or not. So we are just--so we have all these extensions----    Mr. Gibbs. OK. Has any other country established vessel ballast water treatment standards that--you know, that specifically require ballast water management systems that kill these organisms? Has any country done that, or not?    Mr. Gibbs. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
