    Mr. Whitfield. I would like to call the hearing to order this morning, and the subject, of course, is the hearing on EPA's CO<INF>2</INF> Regulations for New and Existing Power Plants. And then, of course, also you all have a proposed rule that is part of this relating to a Federal Implementation Plan in the event States do not act.    And, first of all, Ms. McCabe, we appreciate your being with us this morning as the Acting Assistant Administrator. You've been here many times before, and we genuinely appreciate your being here.    At this time, I would recognize myself for 5 minutes for an opening statement.    Not too many years ago, an autobiography was compiled of Harry Truman and it was entitled, ``Plain Speaking,'' and that's what I intend to do with my opening statement today, just do some plain speaking.    In July, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the Michigan Case that the EPA had acted unreasonably and beyond its scope of authority on Utility MACT by not considering cost. And I was really taken back a little bit by the response that Ms. McCarthy and other spokesmen for EPA gave when they were questioned about that Supreme Court decision.    Basically, every one of them said the regulation was finalized 3 years ago, the companies have already spent the money, so everything has been accomplished, and so basically sort of negating any emphasis on the Supreme Court's decision. And we perceive that that's precisely what is going to happen with this existing and new coal plant rule, that your goal is to have this implemented. Lawsuits we know are going to be filed, but you want to have it implemented so that if the Supreme Court rules against you, everything has already been done.    Now, on the new coal plant rule we have serious problems with it. You know that. Initially, you gave as an example four plants that showed that carbon capture sequestration could be used in these coal plants. One was in Texas, which has not been built; one was in California, which has not been built; one was in Mississippi, which has had extensive cost overruns and without significant investment from the Federal Government never would have been built; and then you've got the Canadian plant, which is really a unit, 110 megawatts. It costs over $1 billion a year. So, there's not any practical way available for anyone using reasonable cost figures to comply with this new rule, because the emission standard is so low that it simply cannot be achieved.    And then on the existing coal plant rule you all talk frequently about oh, we're flexible, and we're maximum flexibility to the States, but you arbitrarily set the CO<INF>2</INF> emission caps for every State, so it's going to be extremely difficult for many of the States to reach these caps.    Now, when I go down to the District in Kentucky and around the country, I hear a lot about this is a rogue agency out to do in the fossil fuel industry. Many people view you as nothing but a political arm of the White House today, as a result of the President's Georgetown speech in which he said, ``I want EPA to act.'' And you all have followed that rule and you've acted. You've actually become a legislative arm, because Congress considered cap and trade, Congress considered CO<INF>2</INF> emissions, and Congress did not act. And I've heard people at EPA and the President say repeatedly, ``Congress did not act, so we are going to act.''    And not only did the Supreme Court invalidate our question and call it unreasonable and acting beyond your scope of authority under the Michigan Case, but also in the Tailoring Rule. It said you went beyond your scope of authority. And then on this existing rule, how can we ever forget that one of the preeminent constitutional lawyers in the country, Larry Tribe, sat right there and said, ``You're burning the Constitution'' by these actions. And you had to reverse about 30 years of legal opinions of EPA itself in order to say you have the authority to act under 111(d).    So, we are very much concerned about your running roughshod over the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Senate, the Governors, the attorney generals, the utilities, the people in the fossil fuel industry, the employees, and the American taxpayers. And it's interesting, the EIA recently reported 2014 electricity rates went up 14 percent, and this year they anticipate them going up another 10 percent, but coal prices are down, natural gas prices are down, and oil prices are down. And, yet, all these independent reports say they're going up because of regulations. So, this committee, we're going to continue to do everything we can do to stop you. And not only that, but we're urging Governors to take action to stop you. And we know that lawsuits are going to continue to be filed, and this will be a big issue in 2016.    [The prepared statement of Mr. Whitfield follows:)                Prepared statement of Hon. Ed Whitfield    This subcommittee has been examining EPA's carbon dioxide regulations for new and existing power plants since they were first proposed. Last August, EPA announced the final versions, and unfortunately none of the fundamental concerns we've raised appear to have been addressed. This EPA has become the political arm of the White House issuing regulations by fiat. It is time to stop and review what these rules mean for the Nation's electricity system and the economy overall. I welcome Acting Assistant Administrator Janet McCabe to this subcommittee.    The new and existing source provisions are the most significant part of the President's Climate Action Plan, and they closely resemble the 2009 Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill in that they comprehensively control the electric sector well beyond the fence line of regulated power plants, and they threaten extraordinary costs yet will do almost nothing to reduce the earth's temperature. I believe that the regulatory version of cap and trade is every bit as inflexible and unworkable as the legislative version that I voted against.    Our Ratepayer Protection Act addressed two major concerns with the existing source rule--its legality and its impact on ratepayers. First, the bill would have extended the compliance deadlines so that the rule's provisions would not take effect until after judicial review is complete. On this point, I am disappointed that EPA has not learned the lesson from its Mercury MACT rule, which the Supreme Court recently found to be legally flawed. This decision came too late to avoid serious economic damage, including the irreversible decision to close several coal-fired power plants in response to this rule. As with the Mercury MACT rule, the existing source rule's aggressive deadlines would necessitate potentially costly compliance measures before we know whether the rule will survive judicial scrutiny. And I might add that there are many reasons to question the legality of this unprecedented measure.    The Ratepayer Protection Act also gave State Governors the authority to waive the existing source rule's provisions if they are determined to have a significant adverse effect either on ratepayers or on reliability. According to an analysis of the proposed rule by NERA, fully 43 States will experience double digit increases in electricity prices--and this is on top of rates that are already increasing due in part to other EPA regulations. Higher electric bills disproportionately hurt low income households and those on fixed incomes.    On reliability, NERC and others with expertise on reliability have warned of the potential adverse impact of the existing source provisions. The final rule may be even more problematic than the proposed version, especially now that EPA has chosen to discourage new natural gas facilities as well as coal in favor of less-reliable renewables like wind and solar.    Few if any of the concerns about the proposed existing source rule were addressed in the final version, and the reasons for the Ratepayer Protection Act are still applicable. And I might add that the new source rule also remains very problematic, as it will serve as a de facto ban on new coal generation. Today, with natural gas as cheap as it is, a ban on new coal may not seem so damaging, but circumstances may change, and I believe the Nation will suffer future adverse consequences from not having new coal generation as an option.    In addition to the new and existing source final rules, I also have serious concerns with EPA's proposed ``Federal Plan,'' which would impose a Federal emissions trading program on any State that does not get its own plan approved. Again, I welcome Acting Administrator McCabe and look forward to learning more about all three rules.    Mr. Whitfield. So with that, my time has expired and I would like to recognize at this time the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Rush.    Mr. Rush. 2016 is right around the corner, Mr. Chairman, and let us all buckle our seat with this wild ride to 2016. I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding today's hearing on the EPA's carbon rules. Certainly, to me, it feels like deja vu all over again.    I also want to thank Assistant Administrator Ms. McCabe for being here today. And as always, I look forward to your thoughtful, insightful, and expert testimony on the matter at hand.    Mr. Chairman, today we will examine EPA's carbon regulation for the exceedingly umpteenth time. At the very outset, I must emphatically commend the agency for its open, its honest responsiveness to stakeholders' concerns in issuing its final rule.    Mr. Chairman, since the last time Ms. McCabe testified before this subcommittee and after serious consideration of thousands of comments from various stakeholders, EPA has made significant changes to the Clean Power Plan.    In regards to timing, the compliance period was pushed back from 2020 to 2022. In the interim reduction goals can be achieved more gradually between 2022 and 2029, and States are provided additional flexibility for reducing their emission from year 2022 all the way up to the year 2030.    Additionally, Mr. Chairman, EPA's final rule provides States up to 3 years if necessary to submit a State plan and also propose a model rule that makes it easier for States to adopt interstate trading as many of them had requested.    No doubt, Mr. Chairman, in response to concerns voiced here repeatedly, EPA's final rule now requires States to consider reliability when developing their plans. It allows flexibility to include a variety of approaches to achieving their goals, and it provides a reliability safety valve for extraordinary circumstances. So, Mr. Chairman, after unprecedented public outreach and engagement, EPA was able to finalize a rule that is fair, that is flexible, and that demonstrates to the world that the U.S. is, indeed, serious in its commitment to lower its carbon imprint in order to address climate change.    And why are these rules so necessary and essential? Plainly speaking, Mr. Chairman, from the vast majority of the American people to the overwhelming majority of the world's climatologists and scientists, from the leaders of the world's most advanced nations to Pope Francis, it seems that almost everyone everywhere understands that climate change is real, and is posing an existential threat to the future of our home, this great planet that we were given stewardship over. That is everyone except the majority party in this Congress.    Plainly speaking, Mr. Chairman, as Mother Nature continues to demonstrate annually year by year, extreme weather patterns and catastrophic events occurring more frequently in every region of our great Nation, climate change is not a hoax. Climate change is not a joke, and climate change is not something that this U.S. Government can continue to ignore or to take lightly, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, climate change is not a hoax. Let's take it seriously. It's a serious matter.    Plainly speaking, Mr. Chairman, while the majority party continues to put its collective heads in the sand and ignore the facts, devastating wildfires burn in the West, the Southeast experiencing thousand-year floods. The Midwest and Plain States see record drought and crop loss, and the American people are standing by anxiously awaiting for some leadership, some leadership on this very important issue from you, from me, from other elected officials, those of us who are members of this Congress.    Mr. Chairman, I applaud the President and the EPA for standing up to protect the environment on behalf of those families out there waiting for their Government to act.    Thank you, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Whitfield. Thank you, Mr. Rush.    At this time, the Chair recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Griffith, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman yields back, and that concludes the opening statements.    So, Ms. McCabe, at this time you're recognized for 5 minutes for your opening statement. Thank you.  STATEMENT OF JANET McCABE, ACTING ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR,     Mr. Whitfield. Thank you, Ms. McCabe. And I recognize myself for 5 minutes of questions.    When do you expect the two rules to be published in the Federal Register?    Mr. Whitfield. Now, did you finalize the rule in August? Is that right, those two rules?    Mr. Whitfield. And you're working with the Office of the Federal Register.    Mr. Whitfield. And who makes the decision on when it's published?    Mr. Whitfield. And how many pages in these rules?    Mr. Whitfield. I mean, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000?    Mr. Whitfield. Well, you know, it's important that they be published in the Federal Register because, as you know, lawsuits have already been filed, but they were filed before they were published.    Mr. Whitfield. And if they're not published, then there's no standing to bring the suit. So, you think they'll be published in October?    Mr. Whitfield. This month?    Mr. Whitfield. Now, under the NAAQS rules, normally EPA gives States 3 years to come up with a plan. This 111(d) is unprecedented, never been used in this way before. You changed your legal opinions because prior to this, your lawyers have said we can't operate this way under 111(d). But why are you giving States only like 13 months to issue a final plan, when under the NAAQS rules you give them up to 3 years?    Mr. Whitfield. This is more complicated.    Mr. Whitfield. No, no, wait. You give them 1 year to submit the plan and then they have to come and ask permission for an additional 2 years. Is that correct?    Mr. Whitfield. Do you have--OK. So, what is the magic of September 2016?    Mr. Whitfield. The rule says that they have to have the plan filed by September 2016.    Mr. Whitfield. And who makes the decision that that request will be granted?    Mr. Whitfield. You make that decision.    Mr. Whitfield. Are you required to give them an extension, or is that at your discretion?    Mr. Whitfield. Now, let me ask you this. Under the new rule, all of us are still scratching our heads. You picked out these four sites. The Boundary Dam Facility in Canada appears to be the only coal project using CCS, carbon capture sequestration, that is actually producing electric power today, the only facility in the world. Is that your understanding?    Mr. Whitfield. Now, let me just say this. I want to note for the record, according to an August Department of Energy communication to a committee hearing record, DOE confirmed that this small Canadian project, 110 megawatts, has and is not likely to achieve the technology-readiness level that demonstrates a commercial scale power system with CCS can operate over the full range of expected conditions. No one expects to be able to meet this standard of 1400, what is it, 1400 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour. That's the standard. Right?    Mr. Whitfield. Whether it's less strict or not, the final is 1,400 pounds of CO<INF>2</INF> per megawatt hour. Is that correct?    Mr. Whitfield. Now, you know the cleanest plant operating in the U.S. today is the Turk plant, Texarkana, Arkansas, built about 2 or 3 years ago. It's at 1,800 pounds, so there's no way to meet this standard.    My time has expired, so I'll recognize the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Rush, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rush. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman yields back. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Barton, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman's time has expired. At th is time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The Chair recognizes the representative of the Houston Astros for 5 minutes, Mr. Olson.    Mr. Whitfield. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. McNerney, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman yields back. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Shimkus, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman yields back. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentlelady from California, Mrs. Capps, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia, Mr. McKinley, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman's time has expired. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Doyle, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. Yes, I should have introduced----    Mr. Whitfield. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Latta, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman's time has expired. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Castor, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentlelady yields back. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas, Mr. Pompeo, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. At this time, the Chair recognizes Mr. Loebsack of Iowa for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman yields back. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Griffith, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman yields back. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, who I guess represents part of Houston, as well, Astros.    Mr. Whitfield. OK, 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Flores, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman yields back. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr. Tonko, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Johnson, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman's time has expired. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Vermont, Mr. Welch, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The gentleman yields back. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Harper, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. At this time, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Yarmuth, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Long, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. The Chair at this time recognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr. Engel, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Whitfield. Well, that concludes the hearing. I have one additional question, and you may or may not have an additional question, Mr. Rush. But, Ms. McCabe, we will be electing a new Governor in Kentucky next month. The Democratic candidate who is currently attorney general, is one of those that filed the lawsuit against EPA. Of course, the lawsuit was dismissed for lack of standing because the rule has not been published in the Register yet, but he's indicated that he will not be submitting a State implementation plan. The Republican candidate for Governor said if he wins, he would not submit a State implementation plan. My question is, what would be the earliest if that occurred that EPA could impose a Federal plan?    Mr. Whitfield. So, what do you think it would be, like 30 days after September 6th?    Mr. Whitfield. I mean, you don't have any idea?    Mr. Whitfield. Would it be a year, or would it be 30 days?    Mr. Whitfield. Do you have any questions?    Mr. Rush. No, I don't have any.    Mr. Whitfield. All right. That concludes today's hearing. Thank you very much.    Mr. Rush. Mr. Chairman?    Mr. Whitfield. Yes.    Mr. Rush. I would like to ask unanimous consent to entering two letters entered in the record, one being a letter from the Medical and Health Community Organization supporting the Clean Power Plan. This is numerous organizations, community health organizations. And two, the letter from the American Lung Association urging the EPA to adopt strong standards to reduce carbon pollution from existing power plants.    Mr. Whitfield. Without objection, and the record will remain open for 10 days. That concludes today's hearing.
