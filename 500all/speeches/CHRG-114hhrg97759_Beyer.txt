    Mr. Beyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank all of you for coming today. It's a fascinating hearing. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for structuring this. And I look forward to our Science, Space, and Technology CODEL for low-Earth orbit. I'm counting on you to assist me in this.    To go quickly, Dr. Siemion, you know, for years we had the PCs at our home following SETI, doing the analysis of the work, and it was fun. We have no successful conclusion yet. I'm fascinated by the $100 million for the Breakthrough project. But what happens when we discover extraterrestrial intelligence? Do we have a plan about what happens next?    Mr. Beyer. It'd be interesting to have protocols in place for when we finally get the breakthrough, what do we say back and the like so--yeah.    And, Dr. Lunine, you talked about Titan and all the methane and ethane and all that, and I sort of basically understand that most elements only come from the explosion of stars, so you'll get the carbon, but are methane and ethane--can they develop other than biologically?    Mr. Beyer. All right. Thank you.    Dr. Stofan, I think this is for you but maybe Dr. Lunine. Dr. Abraham talked about the panspermia, and I know there was a project that evolved out of Harvard or MIT a few years ago trying to replicate the early origin of life on Earth, you know, the primordial soup, organic soup thing. Is there much evidence that--or any evidence that life on Earth may have started someplace else?    Mr. Beyer. Great, thank you.    Dr. Bean, you're--it's fascinating your photos of Enceladus and the fissure, and the--I was trying to--if you could go a little deeper on--are those gases that are being released from--through the fissure that----    Mr. Beyer. Okay. Was it--I'm sorry.    Mr. Beyer. Okay, great.    Mr. Beyer. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Chairman, I yield back.
