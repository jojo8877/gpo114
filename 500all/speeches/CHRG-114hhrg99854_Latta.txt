    Mr. Latta. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to our panel for being with us today, really appreciate it. Sorry we are kind of in and out. We have another committee hearing running with the same thing downstairs.    But if I could, the lighting industry represents about 2,500 jobs in my home State of Ohio, and having talked with several of these manufacturers I have serious concerns with the external power supply energy conservation standard including LED and OLED technologies. And Dr. Hakkarainen, could you give us some examples in real-world applications of these products?    Mr. Latta. Yes, thank you. And if I may, I continue with another question to you. Could you in regular terms explain to us again how these drivers are being impacted by the EPS rule?    Mr. Latta. Well, maybe if I could for both of you, Ms. Amann--am I pronouncing your name correctly?    Mr. Latta. Amann. Thank you. If you could both in summarizing your testimony for us here, but if there is one major thing you would like us to take away from here today what would that be from today's hearing?    Mr. Latta. Thank you. Dr. Hakkarainen, would you like to comment?    Mr. Latta. OK. Thank you very much. And Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
