    Mr. Donovan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Secretary, thank you for your attendance and your testimony today.    In February of this year, the U.N. came out with a report about Vietnam making prohibited purchases of weapons from North Korea. As the President and this administration is about to enter into a trade agreement should their avoiding and actually unlawfully purchasing weapons from North Korea be a consideration as we enter into an agreement with Vietnam?    Mr. Donovan. And you also indicated about supplying North Korea with weapons. That same U.N. Council has indicated to us that Cuba is providing North Korea with illegal weapons. As the administration tries to renew relations with Cuba, should that be a consideration as we go forward?    Mr. Donovan. And finally, Mr. Secretary, yesterday I met with steelworkers from my district. They're very concerned about China manipulating the steel market in the world.    We've had, I think, zero growth in steel production in our country over the last 25 years. I think Europe's steel production is down about 12 percent and there's a fear that China is manipulating by selling steel below market price in order to box everyone else out.    Is the State Department looking into that and what is the position of the administration?    Mr. Donovan. Appreciate that, Mr. Secretary, because I know the American steelworkers would appreciate it as well if you and the administration could look into that.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the rest of my time.
