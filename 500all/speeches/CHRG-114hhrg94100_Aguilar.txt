    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, gentlemen, for joining us.    Mr. Chesney and Mr. Wittes--I am sorry, can you say it one more time?    Wittes. Okay. I was close.    Mr. Chesney and Mr. Wittes, you mentioned during your opening comments the silence that the AUMF has on detention protocols.    So, Mr. Wittes, if you could start, how would the alternative AUMF draft that you created treat detention protocols moving forward, in addition to the current detainees held under the 2001 AUMF?    Mr. Aguilar. Mr. Chesney.    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, gentlemen. And that doesn't take away anything from the broader strategic discussions that my colleagues--some incredible questions that have been asked, but I did want to delve into that piece because it was common between your testimonies, the written and the public, and I appreciate it.    But going back to Congressman O'Rourke's comments, you two gentlemen didn't get to answer that piece, and I know he mentioned possibly putting it in writing, but if you could discuss what you feel winning looks like and what the conditions for us to achieve success would look like.    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, gentlemen.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your patience and yield back.    The Chairman. I appreciate your patience in waiting to get in very good questions.    Mr. Langevin.
