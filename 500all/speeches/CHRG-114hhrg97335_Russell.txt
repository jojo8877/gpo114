    Mr. Russell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Scott, in your role as FED CIO, you will have a great deal of influence over IT policies and practices that Federal agencies must implement. Given your role as a technologist and an IT specialist with years of private sector experience, can you give us a general sense of your impression of the State and Federal information security?    Mr. Russell. Thank you for that.    Mr. Wilshusen, the Partnership for Public Service released a report last week that concluded the Federal Government is not well positioned to recruit a capable cybersecurity workforce. How does recruitment and retention of cyber talent factor in the Government's operational ability to maintain effective cybersecurity?    Mr. Russell. Ms. Seymour, the Sony hack featured an infrastructure attack, meaning hackers not only stole data, but they also destroyed the network itself. What do you think the motivations of this type of attack are, and do you see that there will be more of this in the future? And, if so, what can we do to protect against it?    Mr. Russell. Thank you.    Dr. Fischer, your knowledge and breadth of so many of these issues, where do you see the threat going as we try to put up these defenses? I mean, they are obviously going to anticipate that. What do you see is the attitude of the attacks and those that will perpetrate them? If we could think forward, where would that go so that we can get ahead of the curve instead of always reacting behind it?    Mr. Russell. Thank you for that.    And thank you, Mr. Chairman.
