    Ms. Castor. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this hearing, and thank you to the witnesses. Thank you for your attention to program integrity, and rooting out fraud in Medicaid. In Medicaid, every dollar counts, because these are dollars that go, in large part, to children and their health care needs, and our older neighbors in nursing homes, and other hard working Americans.    Now, CMS has issued several new regulations and guidance just in the past month, and I would like to ask you about them today. Dr. Agrawal, as I understand it, under the proposed regulation for Medicaid managed care organizations, managed care providers would be subject to the same screening requirements as providers for the fee-for-service program, is that correct?    Ms. Castor. And that is especially important because many states are moving their Medicaid programs to managed care models, is that right?    Ms. Castor. In fact, do you know how many states have already shifted, and have instituted Medicaid managed care?    Ms. Castor. Yes.    Ms. Castor. OK. Elaborate on that. Why did CMS make that decision?    Ms. Castor. Good. And, Mr. Bagdoyan, is this a policy change that the GAO supports?    Ms. Castor. OK. Dr. Agrawal, my understanding is that the proposed rule also imposes new internal compliance and program integrity requirements on Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans. Can you walk us through those requirements?    Ms. Castor. And your goal is to complement what is already in place at some states? Some don't have similar safeguards, is that right?    Ms. Castor. OK. I would also like to ask you about the guidance CMS issued earlier this week on criminal background checks and fingerprinting of certain providers in the Medicaid program. First of all, who will be subject to the full background check and fingerprinting requirement, and how will CMS and state agencies determine if a provider represents a high risk?    Ms. Castor. Thank you very much.
