    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Chairman. Dr. Scott Morton, you talked about there should be situations where the courts, Federal courts, should be involved, and not the ITC. Could you give me an example or two of a case or cases, any why?    Mr. Marino. That is fine.    Mr. Marino. Okay. How does timing fit into that with a situation where a court may settle it quicker or the ITC may settle it quicker?    Mr. Marino. But is that the end of litigation, though?    Mr. Marino. Right, the whole process.    Mr. Marino. Thank you. Ms. Okun, you have heard my question. Do you want me to repeat it? Okay. And you heard the response from Dr. Scott Morton. Given the ITC's position on Federal Court vs. ITC--and let's talk about streamlining too, a little bit.    Mr. Marino. I understand that. I am going for your experience.    Mr. Marino. Okay, thank you. Attorney Bianchi, am I correct when--understanding that you said the omission has two sources of remedy exclusion and cease-and-desist?    Mr. Marino. No injunction.    Mr. Marino. Tell me the difference, because I heard one of the panelists referred to exclusion as akin to an injunction. Could you explain that to me, please?    Mr. Marino. At any given time, early on in a case--and we are not talking about the end of the case, correct? An injunction--a court can order an injunction early on if the evidence is there.    Mr. Marino. If they meet the criteria.    Mr. Marino. Okay, I am going to cut to the chase here. You have stated that unlike the Federal courts, the Commission does not institute an investigation before the sufficiency of the complaint is assessed. What can you do--and how long does that take? Let's start with how long did--was--an average investigation take, because that--I am looking at individuals, small businesses, small entrepreneurs with patents who they want their patent--they want to get it out. They want to continue to make money.    Without any injunctive power, based on the fact that you do an investigation, there is a long time--there could be a long period of time by which that individual is waiting for a decision from the Commission. Is that correct?    Mr. Marino. Okay.    Mr. Marino. But you could have an injunction long before two and a half years in a Federal court.    Mr. Marino. I understand.    Mr. Marino. A notice to appear before Federal court.    Mr. Marino. Thank you. And, Chairman, thank you for the extended time.
