    Mr. Takano. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Yehia, as you streamline the eligibility requirements for the various care in the community pathways, what impact do you think it will have on the number of veterans who get their care in the community? Do you have any idea of how many more veterans will be seen through this new Veterans Choice Program?    Mr. Takano. Of course not.    Mr. Takano. Well, you kind of alluded to what I wanted to get to know is, do you have a ballpark projection of the overall estimated costs of the program to be, you know, as you kind of rough out this number, aside from the 1.5 billion for emergency treatment? It is going to be helpful for us to kind of know this.    Mr. Takano. On top of the, what was it we approved, like ten--    Mr. Takano. You might have already covered this, I was just sort of jumping between Committee meetings here, but how much will extending emergency care to veterans cost? Did you already mention that in your testimony?    Mr. Takano. I am going to ask you this sort of offline, but I am real curious about drug treatment for veterans, whether it includes rehabilitation, just to what extent we have case management. I just want to understand that better in terms of our vets that are coming back with PTS and then some that are having some real substance abuse challenges. So I will follow-up with the Department later.    But, Mr. Chairman, my time is up. Thank you.
