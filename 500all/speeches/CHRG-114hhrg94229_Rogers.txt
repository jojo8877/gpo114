    Mr. Rogers. Good afternoon. The Subcommittee on Strategic Forces will come to order. I want to welcome you to our hearing on the President's fiscal year 2016 budget request for atomic energy defense activities at the Department of Energy.    I want to thank our witnesses for being here today. We know how much work goes into preparing for these hearings, and we thank you for putting that time and energy into this endeavor. I want to welcome our guests. We have Lieutenant General Frank Klotz, Administrator of National Security Administration--National Nuclear Security , a little difference; Mark Whitney, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management , U.S. Department of Energy; and Ms. Jessie Hill Roberson, Vice Chairman, Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board .    General Klotz, you have a few very able folks in support of you today and I want to recognize them: Dr. Don Cook, Ms. Anne Harrington, and Admiral John Richardson. If any of our members have questions directly for them later in the hearing, we will ensure that they can step up to the table and answer those as needed.    Before I hand the floor over to the ranking member, let me briefly highlight just a few key issues for today's hearing. First, let's be clear on the Nation's defense priorities. Last November, then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said this: ``Our nuclear deterrent plays a critical role in assuring U.S. national security and it is DOD'S highest priority mission. No other capability we have is more important.'' This is the correct priority, but we must remember that fulfilling the nuclear deterrence mission is the shared responsibility of both DOD and DOE . It is the people, programs, and infrastructure at NNSA's nuclear enterprise that provides our Nation with that deterrent.    The subcommittee will take a detailed look at NNSA's budget request and scrub it hard to ensure it is meeting the military's priorities. In the fiscal environment we are facing, we must prioritize the core mission of the agency while finding efficiencies that can be directly applied to that mission.    This is a strong budget request for NNSA, but I fear it may have only kicked the hardest choices over to Congress. And we must hear from our witnesses about how devastating sequestration, or Budget Control Act, funding levels would be on DOE's defense programs in both NNSA and Environmental Management. Allowing sequestration to hit us again in fiscal year 2016 would be like designing a nuclear hand grenade--just about the dumbest thing we could do.    Moving to governance and management of DOE and NNSA, we have received a report of the Mies/Augustine Advisory Panel, and I look forward to receiving General Klotz's response to that report. I agree with a lot of what the advisory panel recommended, but not all of it. General, I know there is much you and I agree on in this area as well. I hope to explore your thoughts on where we can work together to fix the longstanding problems related to governance and management. We have to get on top of these problems if the NNSA is going to be successful in the long-term. Leadership and accountability will be the key to this.    Let me end on a bright note. This year, the B61 life extension program continues to execute on time and on budget. General, please tell the whole NNSA team to keep up the good work. This is an important step in rebuilding trust and confidence with Congress and the American people and our allies.    Thank you again to our witnesses. I look forward to the discussion. With that, let me turn it over to my friend and colleague from Tennessee, the ranking member, Mr. Cooper, for any opening statement he may have.    Mr. Rogers. Thank you. With that, we will ask each of our witnesses to make an opening statement, and your full statement will be submitted for the record. I would ask you to summarize it in 3 minutes. And without objection, we will accept those for the record.    The witness order will be first General Klotz, then Mr. Whitney, and then Ms. Roberson. So, General Klotz, you are recognized for 3 minutes to summarize your opening statement.    General Klotz. Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Cooper, and members of the subcommittee, I thank you for the opportunity to present the President's fiscal year 2016 budget request for the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration. I am pleased to be joined by Mark Whitney and Vice Chairman Jessie Roberson, who you have already introduced.    We value this committee's leadership in national security as well as its robust and abiding support for the mission and the people of the NNSA. On a personal note, I have benefited enormously from the insight and guidance you have so generously and graciously shared over the past 12 months.    Our budget request, which comprises more than 40 percent of DOE's budget, is $12.6 billion. This is an increase of $1.2 billion, or 10.2 percent over the fiscal year 2015 enacted level. The funding is extraordinarily important to NNSA's missions to maintain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear weapon stockpile; to prevent, counter, and respond to the threat of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism; and to support the capability of our nuclear-powered Navy to project power and protect American and allied interests around the world.    By supporting growth in each of our four appropriations accounts, this budget represents the commitment by the administration to NNSA's vital and enduring missions and to NNSA's role in ensuring a strong national defense. This mission is accomplished through the hard work and innovative spirit of a highly talented workforce committed to public service. To provide them the tools they need to carry out their complex and challenging tasks, both now and in the future, we must continue to modernize our scientific, technical, and engineering capabilities and infrastructure.    In doing so, we are mindful of our obligation to continually improve our business practices and to be responsible stewards of the resources that Congress and the American people have entrusted to us.    For all of these missions, NNSA will continue to drive improvement in acquisition and project management practices and policies as well as Federal oversight over the enterprise. These missions are just a handful of the critical national security work that this budget funds; however, the looming possibility of sequestration is a major threat to NNSA's missions. In developing the budget, NNSA was directed to request the funds we need to accomplish the missions we have been tasked to do. The fiscal year 2016 budget request reflects this.    Another round of sequestration caps would most certainly have devastating impacts on important programs and projects, to include pushing them further out into the future or canceling them altogether. However you slice it, sequestration would adversely and severely affect our capabilities and our capacity to maintain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear weapons stockpile, and to reduce nuclear dangers both at home and abroad.    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cooper, I look forward to discussing these and other issues with you in more detail during the question and answer.    Mr. Rogers. Thank you, General.    Mr. Whitney, you are recognized for 3 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Mr. Whitney.    Ms. Roberson, you are recognized for 3 minutes to summarize your opening statement.    Mr. Rogers. I thank you. Thank you all for those opening statements. I will start with questioning now. I will recognize myself for the first round of questions.    General Klotz, you have a unique perspective to offer this committee on an issue we focused on for some time: governance and management at DOE and NNSA. As the first commander of the Air Force Global Strike Command, you were one of NNSA's primary customers for nuclear weapons work, and now as Administrator, you are in charge of the NNSA. Given your background and experience, I fear that if you can't fix these problems, nobody can.    And let me be clear. I firmly believe that getting NNSA's governance and management on track for the long-term must be one of your core duties.    You owe us a report right now on your views of the Mies/Augustine Advisory Panel's recommendations. As I said in my opening remarks, I agree with a lot of their recommendations, but certainly not all of them.    So tell me, what are your views that you can share with us today on what that report is going to tell us?    General Klotz. I thank you, Chairman. And let me say that I take your charge very seriously that the governance and management of NNSA is, indeed, one of our top priorities, as we move forward.    As far as the Augustine/Mies Panel is concerned, we have stated publicly that we appreciate the hard and long work that the members of the panel put in in giving some very thoughtful consideration to the issues that face NNSA and the entire nuclear security enterprise in terms of its governance and its management, and we appreciate the counsel that they have given in terms of their recommendation.    As we look across the broad 19 overarching recommendations, and 63 sub-recommendations, we find, like you, we are in agreement with most of them. And, in fact, many of the things that they have suggested, for instance, in the area of tightening up program management, instilling more rigor and discipline in project management, in cost estimation, in the relationship between NNSA and the military services and the relationship between NNSA and its laboratories and production plants across the country are things that under Secretary Moniz's leadership and under the leadership team that is currently now in place at NNSA, we have been working very, very hard on.    So we take that as, to some extent, validation, justification for a number of things that we have already moved out very smartly on and are continuing to develop as we move forward.    So I look forward to finishing off the report. I expect some time in the next 3 to 4 weeks, we will be able to deliver it up here, and I look forward to the opportunity to discussing the specific comments that we have in greater detail with you and other members of the committee.    Mr. Rogers. Great. Many of the Mies/Augustine recommendations align with similar efforts this committee has undertaken in the past: reducing transactional oversight, clarifying roles and responsibilities, and improving cost estimation and program management. And although we try to help, many of these problems are not fixable by Congress, but Congress can and will continue to provide guidance, direction, and momentum.    So, General, how can this committee help you address those issues?    General Klotz. Well, first of all, I think you have taken the first most important step, and that is to express your interest, your concern in the governance and management of the     It is so very important for those individuals, those men and women who work within our enterprise, to know that the senior leadership of this government in both the executive branch and the legislative branch understand the importance of the enduring mission which those people perform and care about its safe and successful execution.    So, again, as we come forward with this report, we will have some specific comments on the recommendations in there that we can discuss with you in terms of the way ahead.    Mr. Rogers. The third area I want to ask about is accountability. As a part of our effort to reform DOE and NNSA, we have spent a lot of time in this committee seeking accountability from major failures, the break-in at Y-12, the stunning failure of design and oversight with the UPF that wasted at least half a billion dollars of taxpayers' money, and the decades of wasted effort with CMRR . The list is long.    General, these failures were before your time as the Administrator, but are you aware that not a single Federal official was terminated after these disasters? Several retired and were moved to other jobs, but not one was fired.    So, General Klotz, can you assure this committee that you will hold Federal employees and contractors fully accountable for failures of this magnitude? This committee would like to see a message sent.    General Klotz. Yes, sir, we will. And I think one of the things that we have worked very hard on is to restore good order and discipline and a rigorous approach to both security and to program and project management in the past several months, and we are beginning to see some of the results of our effort in that way. And we will not shrink from holding either Federal officials or the management and operating contractors accountable for their performance in both--when they do well, to recognize that and to congratulate them, as you already have in your opening statement. By the same token, when they fall short of our standards, to make sure that we communicate to them to that.    I think a review of the most recent cycle of fee determination shows that we will take tough action when what we expect from our people and our M&O contractors do not meet our expectations.    Mr. Rogers. Great. I thank you. And I will now recognize the ranking member for any questions he may have.    Mr. Rogers. Thank the ranking member. Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Bridenstine, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. Thank the gentleman. Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Garamendi, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. Okay. We will have another round.    Mr. Rogers. Go ahead.    Mr. Rogers. I thank the gentleman.    Now let's talk about NNSA on deferred maintenance. I and several other members of this subcommittee have had the opportunity to visit Y-12, the labs, the Naval Reactors facility in Idaho with you, General Klotz and Admiral Richardson, and other parts of the NNSA enterprise.    At each stop, I ask for the ugly tour to see some of the massive backlog of deferred maintenance at all of these decrepit facilities, and we saw a lot of ugly. I am putting some slides up on the monitors of the recent roof collapse at the lithium facility at Y-12. A huge chunk of concrete fell into an operational work area. We are lucky no one was hurt or killed. We have also got some pictures from Pantex, which has many areas in equally as bad shape.    Because all of these places are inside secure facilities, I don't think the American people are aware of just how bad these buildings have gotten. We have got weeds growing up out the floors of work areas at Pantex; $14 million diagnostic equipment covered with tarps because of the lab roof leaks; duct tape, which I like duct tape, don't get me wrong, duct tape and plastic around pipes carrying radioactive solutions.    General, you and Secretary Moniz have sought to arrest the growth of the deferred maintenance backlog at NNSA. That is laudable, and I know you will have this committee's full support, but you haven't requested enough money to actually reduce the backlog. What more could you be doing if provided additional funding?    General Klotz. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for you and the committee's leadership on this issue. You are absolutely right. We face a tremendous challenge. More than 40 percent of NNSA's facilities--more than half of NNSA's facilities are over 40 years old. Thirty percent of them date back to the Manhattan Project, that's World War II. And our deferred maintenance figures have risen to nearly $3.7 billion, and without arresting that, would continue to grow.    You rightly pointed out that Secretary Moniz has declared that we will arrest the rise of deferred maintenance across the entire DOE enterprise, not just at NNSA.    We do have some success stories in the past couple of years. This past year, 2014, we moved into a brand-new facility at Kansas City, moving out of a World War II-era factory, aircraft engine factory, into a brand-new state-of-the-art facility, which we attained through a lease with the General Services Administration, GSA, with a private developer. In the process, we have reduced our footprint from roughly 3 million square feet to half that, and reduced our operating costs by $100 million a year.    And in Pantex, we have completed construction, along with the help of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, of a High Explosives Pressing Facility and begun the process of certifying. So we are making inroads.    But what I have observed, both in the NNSA and in my previous career in the Air Force, is, when dollars are constrained, the first dollar goes to the pointy edge of the spear, or goes to the mission program; the next dollar goes for the next mission of priority. And it is only after you have been able to expense those particular requirements do we pay attention to the infrastructure.    Well, quite frankly, we have deferred that too long and the bill has come due, and we need to take some extraordinary measures: One, to fund these, but also to think of new and creative ways in which we can deliver facilities for our people to work in.    Mr. Rogers. Do you, offhand, have a total number it would take to remedy these deferred maintenance issues?    General Klotz. Well, right now our backlog right now is $3.7 billion to do maintenance. Now, we continue to chip away at that, and I think we are getting smarter, or at least more analytical in our approach. We have adopted two processes recently, which the Department of Defense uses to grade the condition of its facilities and to set the priorities, and I think that rigor and discipline will help us refine those numbers even more so.    Mr. Rogers. Great. All right, General. You owe us a plan for two or more public-private partnerships you wish to pursue to get workers out of old, dilapidated buildings and into modern facilities. Do you see these kind of alternative finance agreements as beneficial to your efforts to get out of these old facilities faster?    General Klotz. We do. And as I said, we have had several successes. Two facilities, at Y-12, at Oak Ridge were built in that way. The Kansas City plant has been built in that way. And we will be bringing some additional ideas to you of ways in which we can get people out of facilities, particularly the one at Pantex, into modern, more efficient buildings.    This is important not only for conduct of operations, it is also extraordinarily important, in my view, for the recruitment and retention of the highest caliber people out of our technical schools and out of our graduate schools, because given the opportunity to go work in a facility which would use their scientific, technical, and engineering skills that is brand-new and modern, like many high tech firms are able to offer, or something that is, as you described it, dilapidated, it is a tough sell for recruiting and retaining people into this enterprise.    Mr. Rogers. Yeah. I have been to those facilities, and I have shared this with you and I will share with the panel and the guests here. These people that we have working are very well-educated. They have options. And, first of all, I am amazed that we are able to--and it says a lot about their patriotism, and their belief in how important their work is that they suffer these intolerable conditions. When you see somebody with these educational credentials working in some of the circumstances we just put up on the board, it is just--it is indefensible.    Ms. Roberson, I will talk to you about deferred maintenance.    Mr. Rogers. What are the safety impacts of NNSA's deteriorating infrastructure and the $3.6 billion backlog of deterred maintenance you just heard General Klotz reference? And is all of this decrepit infrastructure becoming a safety hazard?    Mr. Rogers. What is your view of NNSA's plan to remain in these facilities for decades to come?    Mr. Rogers. Has DNSFB provided NNSA with a prioritized list of the safety concerns that you have about these facilities?    Mr. Rogers. Great. Thank you.    The chair now recognizes the ranking member for any additional questions he may have.    Mr. Rogers. Okay. With that, we have just got a couple of items we need to discuss for the record in classified, secure session with General Klotz. So with that, we will recess this for about 5 minutes to walk to the SCIF , and then we will reconvene.    ?      =======================================================================                              March 24, 2015=======================================================================                              March 24, 2015=======================================================================        =======================================================================                             March 24, 2015=======================================================================              =======================================================================                             March 24, 2015=======================================================================          Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, the B61-12 and W76-1 life extension programs are both well underway at this point. Please give us a status update on these programs. Are you confident they will finish on time and on budget?    General Klotz. The B61-12 is in Phase 6.3 (Development Engineering). The B61-12 Life Extension Program (LEP) completed more than 20 B61-12 LEP system-level joint, ground, and aircraft integration tests using functional developmental hardware. The first integration B61-12 LEP bomb assembly and tail kit assembly test was completed with aircraft platform interfaces, and the B61-12 will complete the first joint flight test in 2015. The primary future milestones will be to obtain Phase 6.4 (Production Engineering) approval in FY 2016; to obtain Phase 6.5 (First Production Unit) approval in FY 2019; and to complete the first production unit no later than March 2020. The B61-12 LEP is on schedule and within budget for a first production unit in FY 2020. The W76-1 is in Phase 6.6 (Full Scale Production). Last year, the W76-1 program achieved a major milestone by completing 50 percent of the planned warhead production. Our primary objectives in FY 2015, which are progressing as planned, are to: achieve annual refurbished warhead production rates; deliver refurbished warheads on schedule to the Navy for deployment; and produce and deliver joint test assemblies (JTA) for surveillance flight tests. In fact, NNSA has been successful in already completing half of the total planned warhead delivery quantities to the Navy for the year within the first third of the fiscal year. We are currently on schedule to complete the remaining FY 2015 warhead production and deliveries to the Navy, which should be accomplished within our current funding allocations. If the requested funding is received, we are confident the program can remain on schedule for completion of production in FY 2019.    Mr. Rogers. What are the major risks to these programs executing successfully? Are they technical? Or are they in getting the funding needed to execute?    General Klotz. The major risks to successful execution of W76-1 LEP production and B61-12 LEP engineering development are a combination of technical and funding risks which adversely affect the execution of warhead production and delivery schedules. In addition, other risks of primary concern to the W76-1 LEP are single-point failures associated with aging infrastructure (facilities and production equipment) within the nuclear weapons complex. We continue to reduce these risks by replacing aging infrastructure and by maintaining margin to delivery requirements. Funding requested for these two programs in FY 2016 FYNSP continues their current progress.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, are you confident the uranium facility in Tennessee and the plutonium facility in New Mexico will each be successfully built on the timelines and budgets NNSA has laid out in the FY16 budget request? Can you assure this committee that these critical facilities will be built on-time and on-schedule?    General Klotz. NNSA is confident that we will successfully deliver CMRR and UPF after we complete our designs and establish performance baselines for these projects. Over the past four years, NNSA has focused on putting the right policies, principles, people, processes, procedures, and partnerships in place to implement the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Circular A-11 for Capital Acquisition Projects, Department of Energy Order 413.3B on project management and the Secretary's January 2015 enhanced project management policies. In 2013, GAO narrowed the focus of its High Risk list for NNSA to contracts and projects with a Total Project Cost greater than $750 million as a result of the improvements NNSA is making in its contract and project management. NNSA is confident that the same policies and processes are scalable to the Major System Acquisition projects, such as CMRR and UPF.    On both projects, NNSA is in the process of developing a high quality credible estimates utilizing NNSA's policies and procedures and GAO's best practices. Once these complex first-of-a-kind nuclear projects achieve 90% design maturity, NNSA will establish cost and schedule baselines that we are confident we can achieve.    Mr. Rogers. What are the major risks to successfully completing these projects?    General Klotz. Major risks to completion are:    <bullet>  Escalation on commodities and equipment procurements;    <bullet>  Inability to attract and retain nuclear qualified workers at assumed labor rates with the possible resurgence of industrial and nuclear construction;    <bullet>  Availability of vendors qualified to produce materials and equipment to meet current nuclear construction standards (NQA-1);    <bullet>  Changes to project requirements, codes, and standards;    <bullet>  Delays in authorizations to start construction activities consistent with the proposed execution approach.    Mr. Rogers. What happens if NNSA does not successfully complete these projects on the timelines laid out? What risks to safety and to NNSA's mission does this incur?    General Klotz. The UPF project in Tennessee is vital to modernization efforts at Y-12, allowing the NNSA to cease enriched uranium (EU) programmatic operations in Building 9212 no later than FY 2025. The NNSA is committed to ceasing these operations and is executing a strategy to deliver the critical UPF project while making additional program investments at the Y-12 Plant. These additional program investments allow the most hazardous operations in Building 9212 to be stopped prior to FY 2025, reducing the safety risks and program risks immediately upon doing so. Failure to deliver the UPF project by FY 2025 would result in a major delay in ceasing casting, special oxide production and salvage and accountability operations from Building 9212.    The execution of Radiological Laboratory Utility Office Building (RLUOB) Equipment Installation Phase 2 (REI2) and PF-4 Equipment Installation (PEI) is critical to maintaining continuity in our analytical chemistry (AC) and materials characterization (MC) capabilities. Failure to complete these activities on the projected schedule may impact our ability to cease programmatic operations in the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) facility in 2019, and would likely impact our ability to provide the AC and MC capabilities needed to support pit production and other plutonium activities at Los Alamos National Laboratory.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, do you believe your Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation programs align with the highest nuclear risks around the world? How do you prioritize NNSA's nonproliferation funding and direct it to the highest priority risks? Do you rely on intelligence community assessments of those risks?    General Klotz. Previously, each program office under the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN) appropriation has applied rigorous internal risk assessment and prioritization approaches (including Intelligence Community assessments) to inform, develop, and provide the foundation for its fiscal year funding request. Although significant program-level coordination continues, the realignment of the Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response (NCTIR) Program under the DNN appropriation, the reorganization of the Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and the standup of NNSA's new Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation Office will now provide NNSA with a more integrated structure for program planning, budgeting, and evaluation as well as cross-program prioritization.    NNSA participates in whole-of-government policy and program coordination processes to ensure that NNSA activities are aligned and integrated with broad U.S. national priorities and capabilities. NNSA, working particularly with the Departments of State and Defense, has been central to U.S. efforts to develop and implement domestic and international programs and strategies to meet the enduring and evolving challenges to the global nuclear security environment.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, counterintelligence and cybersecurity threats to NNSA and its facilities are increasing in quantity and sophistication. Can you assure us NNSA can defend against all of these threats and prevent the escape of sensitive information?    General Klotz. The current cyber defense model deployed by NNSA Headquarters, laboratories and plants has provided the necessary protection of NNSA information and information assets without any major compromises to date. However, it is important to note that with the increase in the number of threats and threat actors to the Nuclear Security Enterprise the current model will not remain effective or efficient without changes to the protection capabilities currently in place. These changes not only include replacement, upgrades, and/or enhancement to the technical infrastructure, but also an increase in the number, type, and skill level of the personnel required to protect these environments.    We use a risk-based approach to evaluate tools/program/software/hardware and their potential impact to our security environment. This security approach implements a defense-in-depth strategy to deter, detect, respond, and recover. These tools include firewalls, malware detection, intrusion prevention systems, and anti-virus systems on desktop workstations; custom tools and applications; and Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products within DOE/NNSA that were developed by the plants and labs across the Nuclear Security Enterprise (NSE). We constantly evaluate new tools that can enhance our current capabilities. The current threat environment requires our cyber defenses to be effective 100% of the time while our adversaries only have to succeed once to inflict major harm to our systems and networks. I am confident that our current cyber defense program is deterring the threats we face today, and we will implement the tools necessary to maintain security as threats evolve.    Mr. Rogers. Are NNSA's management and operating contractors able to meet their requirements on cybersecurity and counterintelligence?    General Klotz. Management and operating (M&O) contractors implement the current Risk Management Framework (RMF) approach. Implementation of the RMF is a signed agreement between the M&O Director and the NNSA Field Office Manager, regarding how the site will deploy cyber defenses to protect the information and information assets within the funding model for the site. Under the current Risk Management Framework, the security framework is signed off on by the federal site lead for cybersecurity. Once the federal lead has signed off on the framework the M&O has the authority to operate the system within the standards of the framework. If the M&O is required to implement a standard which is not within the current agreement, the M&O must go back to the federal lead for agreement before implementation of the new standard or requirement.    Mr. Rogers. Please update us on the status of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico subsequent to the events early last year that caused a radiation release and shutdown of the facility's underground operations. How long do you expect the shutdown to last?    General Klotz and Mr. Whitney. The Department's target for initial resumption of waste emplacement at WIPP is the first quarter of calendar year 2016. The safety envelope for the facility continues to be analyzed and DOE will only resume operations when it is safe to do so.    Mr. Rogers. How is the shutdown at WIPP sending ripple effects across the NNSA and DOE-EM complex?    General Klotz and Mr. Whitney. The current plan for recovery of the WIPP is to begin initial disposal operation in 2016 and resume full operations in the 2018 timeframe, but DOE will only resume operations when it is safe to do so. Active transuranic (TRU) waste generators other than Los Alamos National Laboratory (Idaho, Oak Ridge and Argonne National Laboratory) are continuing characterization and certification activities and are providing interim storage of TRU waste for eventual shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). TRU waste generator sites have storage capacity for certified waste ready for WIPP disposal through at least fiscal year 2016.    Mr. Rogers. How is NNSA holding the people and organizations responsible for this incident accountable?    General Klotz and Mr. Whitney. As required, the Office of Environmental Management), NNSA, Carlsbad Field Office, Nuclear Waste Partnership, LLC (the WIPP management and operations contractor), and LANL will develop corrective actions to address the issues identified in the accident investigation report for the WIPP radiological event. Based on information identified to date, the following actions have been taken to ensure accountability for the event.    <bullet>  Since the WIPP event, LANL has performed extensive scientific reviews, changed leadership in the Environmental Programs Directorate, completed an external root cause analysis and is currently performing an extent of condition review. LANL will evaluate its ongoing recovery efforts and will ensure corrective actions to address issues in the report are integrated with its overall recovery efforts.    <bullet>  The November 14, 2014 EM Transition Plan documented a decision to remove EM-funded program work from the LANL contract and require future legacy environmental cleanup work at Los Alamos performed by a separately competed EM contract.    <bullet>  The November 14, 2014 EM Transition Plan for Los Alamos also focuses on streamlining and clarifying roles and responsibilities between EM and NNSA. Consistent with this plan, the EM Los Alamos Field Office was stood up on March 22, 2014 to manage the EM-funded program work.    <bullet>  Enhanced oversight by the Carlsbad Field Office and EM HQ will occur prior to the resumption of repackaging of TRU waste at LANL, and as the normal course of business at LANL and other sites in the future, e.g., the Certification Program will focus additional oversight efforts on understanding and validating upstream waste processing. Enhanced DOE Order 435.1, Radioactive Waste Management oversight is being planned.    <bullet>  NNSA Los Alamos Field Office has hired or is in the process of hiring key staff positions to enhance its oversight capability. Such positions include the Senior Safety Technical Advisor (on board as of March 8, 2015), an Assistant Manager for Operations, a Deputy Assistant Manager for Operations, a temporary Deputy Manager with a strong safety background (on board in a few weeks), Safety Basis Specialists and Facility Representatives.    <bullet>  NWP finalized its contractor recovery team in the spring of 2014, shortly after the event. Changes included a new Project Manager and Deputy Project Manager (who also serves as the Recovery Manager). Other new managers hired by NWP: Deputy Recovery Manager, Environmental Safety and Health manager, nuclear safety leader, maintenance manager, radiological manager, emergency manager, procedures and training manager, deputy operations manager, and deputy engineering manager.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, what are your top priorities for Naval Reactors (NR) for FY16?    General Klotz. All of Naval Reactors' budget supports the safe and effective operation of the nuclear-powered Fleet, today and tomorrow. Naval Reactors' funding requests can be directly linked to this single, over-arching priority of supporting the safe and effective operation of the nuclear-powered fleet. In FY16, this entails effective oversight of the operation and maintenance of 96 reactors in 71 submarines, 10 aircraft carriers, and 4 training and research reactors. This priority will be met in the most effective and judicious way possible. The main components that support today's operating fleet are Naval Reactors Operations and Infrastructure (NOI), Naval Reactors Development (NRD), Program Direction and Construction. The remainder of the budget, primarily OHIO-Class Replacement Reactor Systems Development, S8G Prototype Refueling and the Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project, supports tomorrow's fleet. In FY16, the OHIO-Class Replacement project will continue life of the ship reactor core manufacturing development activities and detailed design of reactor plant heavy equipment to support FY19 GFE procurement. The S8G Prototype Refueling will continue construction of the Radiological Work and Storage Building and preparations for the FY18 refueling. The Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project will continue required development, fuel design, and will issue an Environmental Impact Statement.    Mr. Rogers. Is NR's budget aligned with that of the larger Navy?    General Klotz. Yes. We work closely every day with our partners in the Navy to ensure that we are aligned with the mission, performance requirements and schedules.    Mr. Rogers. What happens if this program gets out of alignment with Navy programs like the OHIO-class Replacement program?    General Klotz. Naval Reactors' Department of Energy and Navy efforts are directed at supporting this schedule, including development of the propulsion plant design to support procurement of long-lead components in FY19 to support a construction start in FY21 and ship delivery in FY28. After completing ship operational testing, the first OHIO-Class Replacement must be on strategic patrol by 2031 to meet STRATCOM force level requirements. Given that the first OHIO-Class Replacement submarine, a ship twice the size of the VIRGINIA-Class submarine, is planned to be constructed within the same span of time; this schedule is aggressive and requires close coupling of Department of Energy and Department of Navy activities to ensure on time ship delivery. The design and construction of OHIO-Class Replacement is a complex effort that requires extensive coordination between not only Naval Reactors and the Navy's Shipbuilders, but also the Navy's Strategic Systems Programs that are responsible for the missile systems and the British Navy, who will use the Common Missile Compartment design in their upcoming SSBNs. Because they each depend so heavily on each other, these four design efforts must be synchronized, in close collaboration to retire risk early and minimize estimated construction costs.    Given the criticality of Naval Reactors' Department of Energy activities to Navy priorities and mission, funding cuts to Naval Reactors' DOE budget can adversely impact strategic objectives and plans, especially ship design and construction and nuclear operator training.    Mr. Rogers. What has been the effect of the budget cuts Naval Reactors has received over the past four or five years?    General Klotz. Over the past six years, Congress reduced Naval Reactors' funding by more than $600M below the Budget requests. These reduced funding levels have substantially impacted plans to recapitalize the spent fuel handling infrastructure, advanced technology development, and maintenance on prototype reactors, facilities and infrastructure. These functional areas are foundational to the Program and support Naval Reactors' ability to sustain the current nuclear-powered fleet and develop the future fleet. The following are specific examples of these impacts:    <bullet>  Recapitalization of the naval nuclear spent fuel handling capability has been delayed by over five years. This delay has increased the project cost by more than $400M. As well, to manage the delay without affecting aircraft carrier schedules, the Navy will have to procure additional, otherwise unnecessary spent fuel shipping containers at a cost of approximately $500M. Because of the aging condition of the current facility, these delays also increase the risk that the current capabilities fail and we are unable to support the Navy's refueling schedule or conduct the research required to resolve important technical issues in the operating fleet. Therefore, additional investment has been required to maintain these aging facilities.    <bullet>  Advanced technology development has been drastically reduced. Today, it is possible to design a life-of-ship core for the OHIO-Class Replacement, saving the Nation over $40B, because of technology development efforts conducted over the last four decades. Other leaps in stealth and operational technologies give our ships an enormous advantage over our adversaries. With current funding levels, there will be insufficient reactor technology developed in time for use in the next classification of nuclear powered ships to make advances such as this achieved for the OHIO-Class Replacement. Therefore, this work must be restored in order to maintain tactical superiority over our adversaries of the future and to attract and maintain the crucial engineering and scientific talent needed to successfully complete the mission at current levels.    <bullet>  Maintenance and replacement of the Program's aging laboratory facilities and infrastructure has been delayed. Many of these facilities date from the dawn of the atomic age and are vital to support the nuclear-powered Fleet. In total, over 40 General Plant Projects and 4 Major Construction Projects have been delayed or canceled. In addition, funding reductions have resulted in the deferral of critical infrastructure maintenance resulting in significant failures and restriction of Naval Reactors' ability to manage the impact of emergent work as the existing infrastructure continues to age. Examples include:        <bullet>  Bettis High Power Transformer (Failed in 2014)        <bullet>  Bettis Acoustic Testing Generator (Failures over 2009         to 2011)        <bullet>  NRF Storm Drain System (Failed in 2014)        <bullet>  NRF Prototype Facilities (Roof failed in 2014)        <bullet>  KAPL Water Main (Repeated Failures since 2004,         approx. 3-4 per year)        <bullet>  Bettis Spring Water Intercept System (Failed in 2011         and 2013)        <bullet>  Bettis Materials Evaluation Laboratory (Legacy         Radioactive Contamination)    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, what happens to NNSA's programs if you are hit with sequestration in FY16? Will you still be able to deliver on DOD's top priorities, including life extension programs, nuclear infrastructure modernization, and Naval Reactors programs?    General Klotz. The 2016 Budget proposes to reverse sequestration, paid for with a balanced mix of commonsense spending cuts and tax loophole closers, while also proposing additional deficit reduction that would put debt on a downward path as a share of the economy. The President has made clear that he will not accept a budget that reverses our progress by locking in sequestration going forward. Locking in sequestration would bring real defense and non-defense funding to the lowest levels in a decade. It would damage our national security, ultimately resulting in a military that is too small and equipment that is too old to fully implement the defense strategy. It would also damage our economy, preventing us from making pro-growth investments. As the President has stated, he will not accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national and economic security, both of which are important to the Nation's safety, international standing, and long-term prosperity.    Mr. Rogers. In FY13, DOD was given the chance to protect certain programs from sequestration. It chose to protect ongoing operations in Central Command and sustainment and operation of U.S. nuclear forces. Given a choice under a potential sequestration in FY16, as Administrator what NNSA programs would you choose to protect?    General Klotz. The 2016 Budget proposes to reverse sequestration, paid for with a balanced mix of commonsense spending cuts and tax loophole closers, while also proposing additional deficit reduction that would put debt on a downward path as a share of the economy. The President has made clear that he will not accept a budget that reverses our progress by locking in sequestration going forward.

As the President has stated, he will not accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national and economic security, both of which are important to the Nation's safety, international standing, and long-term prosperity.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, this committee has focused on ensuring we get maximum value for every dollar. We've included language in several previous NDAA's encouraging NNSA to go find efficiencies and cost savings that we can apply directly to NNSA's mission. Specifically, what efficiencies are you striving for in FY15? What efficiencies are you proposing to chase in your FY16 budget request?    General Klotz. NNSA is continuously looking for ways to improve use of resources to support its missions. During the past few years, NNSA worked with DOE to streamline DOE orders and directives to eliminate duplication, incentivize cost savings in management and operating contracts, make use of contract vehicles that appropriately share cost risk between the government and the contractor, and encourage NNSA plants and laboratories to more efficiently use resources.    Together, NNSA and its NNSA's M&O contractors are committed to making the National Nuclear Security Enterprise a model for efficient business operations. Large scale efforts undertaken by NNSA recently to drive down operating costs include the relocation of the Kansas City Plant to a more modern facility, the competition of the Pantex and Y-12 plants as a combined contract, and more efficient approaches to replacement of aging uranium and plutonium facilities. The award of the combined Pantex and Y-12 plants resulted in immediate cost savings that will continue to save in fiscal year (FY) 2015 and beyond. For example, the government realized an immediate savings of roughly $80 million in decreased award fee; money that was redirected to national security missions. Efficient business operations across the enterprise are critical to achieving the NNSA mission.    On November 20, 2014, NNSA initiated an annual efficiencies review as an internal tool to drive continuous improvement in managing infrastructure. NNSA laboratories, plants, and federal Field Office Managers were directed to identify specific plans to pursue efficiencies for the current fiscal year and record achievements from the previous one. NNSA also sought input on oversight and governance changes that could enhance productivity.    NNSA laboratories, plants, and federal Field Office Managers are in the process of sharing efficiency ideas from this effort and addressing suggestions from the labs and plants on changes NNSA can make to further efficiencies. NNSA also sponsored a day-long workshop with all of the NNSA labs, plants, and field offices at the end of May. The group will establish a framework of common definitions and best practices to enable an enterprise-wide approach which can be repeated year to year. NNSA is committed to continuous improvement and driving more efficient operations. The identified efficiencies for FY 2014 covered a broad range of business operations. These included reducing the costs of goods and services, making major mission operations such as those at the National Ignition Facility more efficient, better managing the growing costs of employee benefit programs, and reducing key subcontracting costs. Efficiencies of this type will be critical to meeting FY 2016 mission.    Finally, the FY 2014 budget request identified $320 million in efficiencies that would be obtained in executing the FY 2014 budget, and Section 3114 of the FY 2014 NDAA directed the identification of about half, or $139.5 million, in efficiencies during FY 2014. As reported in its May 214 Notification of NNSA Efficiencies, NNSA identified $80 million of these efficiencies.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, one of the big recommendations coming out of the Y-12 security incident in 2012 was that roles and responsibilities for security were not clear at NNSA or its contractors. What specific action have you taken since taking the helm a year ago to clarify roles, responsibilities, authority, and accountability for each person at NNSA? Have you updated any NNSA directives? Spelled them out in policy guidance?    General Klotz. Prior to my appointment, my predecessor issued a memorandum (dated 5 December, 2014) which made fundamental changes to the Office of the Associate Administrator for Defense Nuclear Security/Chief, Defense Nuclear Security (NA-70), by moving and consolidating the lines of operational authority, accountability, and line management. That reorganization transferred to NA-70 the mission and functions of security operations from NA-00-30 as well as the budget activity from NA-00-50 (within the Office of the Associate Administrator for Infrastructure and Operations). We are currently in the process of publishing a supplemental directive that will further delineate responsibilities for oversight of our security programs.    During my first year as NNSA Administrator, I have made it my priority to select and staff key senior leadership positions with seasoned leaders, possessing extensive nuclear security experience. I've firmed up our Office of Defense Nuclear Security senior leadership by hiring career security managers, with a proven track record in leading organizations to success, for the following positions: Chief of Defense Nuclear Security (CDNS), Deputy CDNS and Director of Security Operations and Programmatic Planning.    This full complement of Senior Executive Service managers provides much needed continuity and stability to our Enterprise Field Offices in the area of security. The addition of my Principal Deputy Administrator in July 2014, is also having a positive impact on security decisions as we move forward.    A new M&O contractor has been selected since the 2012 Y-12 security incident. Consolidated Nuclear Security (CNS) began operating our Pantex and Y-12 sites on 1 July 2014. They are bringing a fresh perspective to site operations, which include all aspects of security operations. It also places all security operations are under one contract. That was not the case in 2012 when the incident occurred. Shortly after CNS began operations, the DOE Office of Enterprise Assessments conducted an assessment at Y-12. The report regarding the inspection, conducted in August of 2014, states: ``significant progress has been made in correcting many of the deficiencies identified during the 2012 inspection.''    Based on the inspection results, the DOE Departmental Internal Control and Audit Review Council, comprised of senior members of DOE leadership, recommended downgrading the Y-12 security issue from a material weakness to a reportable condition. The CDNS will continue to monitor the implementation of corrective actions at the site until they are closed.    Lastly, our Federal team has taken a more direct and active role in contractor oversight. Several teams comprised of subject matter experts from our Headquarters and across NNSA have provided assessments of Y-12 security operations. Examples include one team focused on nuisance and false alarm analysis and a team that recently assessed physical security system maintenance, operations and management. These assessments resulted in recommendations focused on continuously improving operations at Y-12.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, DNFSB sent you a recommendation on concerns with DOE/NNSA's emergency management and response. What is your organization doing to improve in this area?    General Klotz. The Department of Energy (DOE) is committed to achieving an end state of an improved Emergency Management Enterprise, and more specifically, improving emergency preparedness and emergency response capabilities across its defense nuclear facilities. DOE/NNSA will implement actions to prioritize improvements related to the DNFSB report findings and DOE's self-assessed need for improvements. The Department has developed an Implementation Plan containing initiatives that address all three aspects of Readiness Assurance at defense nuclear facilities: improve the management and oversight process, improve the corrective actions process, and reinvigorate a reporting process that shares successes and opportunities with DOE leadership. In addition, the Department will revise and restructure its Emergency Management Order, DOE Order 151.1C, Comprehensive Emergency Management System. The restructured Order will bring ease of application and consistency to emergency management programs. It will also be flexible enough to provide comprehensive guidance for users to respond to incidents ranging from local, single facility events, to multiple facility regional events.    In addition to developing the Implementation Plan, DOE/NNSA has been working to improve emergency management. This included required evaluation reviews of emergency response for severe accidents and/or events that could have widespread impact at all DOE facilities, including defense nuclear facilities. These reviews have resulted in activities to expand plans for severe event scenarios at defense nuclear facilities. Also, additional training for responders was conducted at many of the defense nuclear facilities and a series of discussion-based tabletop exercises was performed to verify severe event procedures, interfaces and resources for multi-facility events, offsite asset resources and priorities, and critical decision-making. This training was followed by full-scale exercises at ten defense nuclear facilities, to formally test their capabilities for responding to severe events.    Other examples of emergency management program improvements across the defense nuclear complex included:    Severe event related improvements    <bullet>  Sandia--Conducted a Self-Assessment of Severe Natural Phenomena Events (NPE) that identified issues related to habitability and back-up power; corrective actions were developed and are being implemented and tracked.    <bullet>  Livermore--Improved the habitability of the site's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) with the replacement of four high-efficiency gas absorption (HEGA) filters.    <bullet>  Livermore--Established a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program to support its Emergency Response Organization (ERO) and the site population after a disaster/severe event.    <bullet>  Nevada--Implemented fully functional primary and alternate facilities for both the Operations Command Center and the Emergency Operations Center.    <bullet>  Idaho--Conducted a severe Natural Phenomena Event (NPE) exercise that identified issues related to habitability and back-up power; corrective actions were developed and are being implemented and monitored.    Training and drill improvements    <bullet>  Sandia--Revised training procedures to include annual performance testing to demonstrate competency. Conducted self-assessment and identified an issue in training record documentation.    <bullet>  Nevada--Drill and Exercise Program is integrated with the issues management processes and incorporates exercise After Action Report findings into an issue, which is assigned to a Responsible Manager.    Exercise improvements    <bullet>  Sandia--Severe event exercise scheduled for July 2015 to verify corrective actions implemented from FY 2014 Severe Event Exercise are effective.    <bullet>  Livermore--Conducted four exercises in FY 2014 in response to a NPE (e.g., earthquake) to demonstrate ability to respond to simultaneous events at multiple hazardous facilities.    <bullet>  SRS--SRNS-Tritium facility developed and conducted a tornado drill with all of the shifts affecting multiple facilities and all non-essential personnel.    <bullet>  West Valley Demonstration Project--Conducted an exercise to test and validate the effectiveness of the Emergency Response Organization, Technical Support Center, Incident Command, Joint Information Center and field support.    Readiness assurance improvements    <bullet>  Sandia--Conducted Self-Assessments to identify issues with Corrective Action implementation.    <bullet>  Livermore--Established an Accountability Disaster Call Center to improve communications with the field during a major earthquake or other disaster event and to provide prioritized damage assessment information to the Fire Branch Disaster Dispatch Center.    <bullet>  Savannah River Site--DOE issued a formal letter to SRNS directing a comprehensive, independent review of all of the emergency management elements to address concern about a decline in the emergency management program.    <bullet>  Nevada--Emergency Management program has qualified and experienced staff in developing/facilitating Root Cause Analysis to address the root issue and the extent of condition.    <bullet>  Emergency Operations is developing a process to track findings/deficiencies identified during site assessments. Each finding will have a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) and will be tracked to closure. Over time, the CAPs will produce trending data that will indicate where the Office of Environmental Management should shift the focus of site assessments and surveys. EM will periodically re-examine the effectiveness of closed CAPs after implementation of the corrective action(s).    <bullet>  Sandia--Identified an issue that resources are not adequate to implement an effective readiness assurance program, then submitted and received approval for a Full Time Equivalent (FTE)/Funding request for a Program Administration Team Lead.    DOE Headquarters undertook several initiatives over the past year to address emergency management issues across its full range of responsibilities, which also enhance our capabilities to respond to emergencies at defense nuclear facilities.    DOE established an Energy Incident Management Council (EIMC), chaired by the Deputy Secretary, to increase cooperation and coordination across the Department to prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from emergencies. DOE's ongoing project to revitalize the Headquarters Emergency Management Team (EMT includes rewriting the HQ Emergency Plan and implementing procedures; conducting job task analyses and developing position specific training for EMT members; and retraining EMT members on these new procedures. Plans for testing this expanded capability include frequent testing of the EMT in response to a variety of emergency response scenarios such as:    <bullet>  nuclear weapons accident,    <bullet>  radiological release,    <bullet>  hazardous chemical spill, and    <bullet>  severe event damage to DOE defense nuclear facilities.    DOE's working relationship with its Federal interagency partners was improved during 2014 through a series of exercises, most notably the annual multi-agency nuclear weapons accident exercise, 2014 NUWAIX, for which DOE was the lead planning agency.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, I and several members of this subcommittee joined you and Admiral Richardson on a trip to the Naval Reactors Facility in Idaho last month. What goes on at this facility and why does the budget request include funding for recapitalization of the Spent Fuel Handling facility out there?    General Klotz. The Expended Core Facility (ECF) at the Naval Reactors Facility in Idaho is the only facility in the country capable of receiving, examining and packaging spent Naval nuclear fuel.    The budget request includes funding the Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project (SFHP) at the Naval Reactors Facility which will provide a new facility to replace the more than 55-year old ECF for receipt, preparation, and packaging of naval spent nuclear fuel for secure dry storage. Although the Expended Core Facility continues to be maintained and operated in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, it no longer efficiently supports the nuclear fleet. Further, increasing sustainment efforts and required infrastructure upgrades pose a substantial risk to Expended Core Facility operations and production workflow, thereby challenging Naval Reactors' ability to support the Navy's nuclear-powered fleet refueling and defueling schedules. An interruption to these refueling and defueling schedules would adversely affect the operational availability of the nuclear fleet. If this interruption were to extend over long periods, the ability to sustain fleet operations would be impacted, ultimately resulting in significant decrement to the Navy's responsiveness and agility to fulfill military missions worldwide.    Mr. Rogers. Absent this funding, will costs increase in the long-term for either NNSA or the Navy?    General Klotz. The main risk of further cost increases to the Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project is a lack of funding stability. One could expect cost increases if the project is not funded sufficiently to meet the current schedule. Further delays to the project would also incur costs for additional spent fuel shipping containers that would be borne by the Navy.    The original Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project plan included a project duration of 10 years and a total project cost estimate of $1.249B. Due to funding restrictions since FY12, the project has been extended nearly six years, resulting in a project cost increase of approximately $400M. The increased cost resulted from escalation due to these delays and inefficiencies and rework associated with the unstable funding environment, which has required de-staffing and re-staffing of the project multiple times. Further, the estimated total project cost of the Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project does not account for the additional M-290 shipping containers that the Navy will need to procure for temporary storage of naval spent nuclear fuel until the new spent fuel handling facility becomes operational. Procurement of these additional shipping containers is only necessary because the project has been delayed, as discussed above. To support aircraft carrier refueling schedules, the Navy will need to procure these containers at a total cost of approximately $500M.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, how is NNSA supporting next year's Nuclear Security Summit in Chicago? What initiatives are being proposed for discussion at the Summit and what is NNSA doing to advance them?    General Klotz. NNSA is carrying out activities across many of its program areas in support of the Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) process. NNSA has designated a Senior Coordinator who acts as a liaison for the Department of Energy (DOE) to the White House on all Summit issues. The coordinator facilitates DOE input to the NSS planning process, including in drafting NSS Action Plans to sustain the work of Summit participants through institutions and initiatives like the International Atomic Energy Agency, United Nations, Interpol, the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, and the G7 Global Partnership.    In advance of the 2016 NSS, NNSA also plays a leading role in the development of a range of specific country and regional plans. These action plans will propose how to accelerate the completion of existing Summit deliverables and on how to identify specific opportunities for new Summit deliverables, including actions we can take bi- or multilaterally to secure, reduce and eliminate nuclear and radiological materials. NNSA will continue to implement and complete commitments from the 2010, 2012, and 2014 Summits, including minimizing highly enriched uranium and plutonium, detecting nuclear smuggling, strengthening strategic trade controls, and increasing security of nuclear and radiological materials.    Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, please provide us a description of accountability actions taken towards contractors and Federal employees with responsibility for major recent failures, such as the UPF design, the WIPP event, and the Y-12 security incident. How were they penalized? Were any terminated from employment? Did any of these contractors or Federal employees receive bonuses subsequent to those failures?    General Klotz. Mr. Rogers. General Klotz, Naval Reactors has taken significant funding reductions to its technical base in recent years. What is the technical base, why is it important, and what are the impacts of cuts to NR's base operations?    General Klotz. The Base solely supports Naval Reactors' responsibilities that allows for a safe and reliable operation of the nuclear fleet. It contains Naval Reactors Operations and Infrastructure (NOI), Naval Reactors Development (NRD), and Program Direction (PD). It includes resources to meet the goals and operational demands of today's fleet, to develop tomorrow's fleet, to support environmental stewardship, and to procure and construct the required tools and infrastructure that facilitate Naval Reactors' mission. Naval Reactors executes these responsibilities by management and regulation of an enterprise that includes over 7,000 highly-skilled personnel at Department of Energy laboratories and prime contractors, a specialized domestic nuclear power industrial base of 28 principal suppliers, 110 secondary suppliers with about 25,000 personnel, more than 64,000 workers at the nation's six nuclear-capable shipyards, and over 16,000 trained nuclear operators. This team collaborates with experts at other DOE National laboratories where there are opportunities for mutual gain. No other single organization in the U.S. currently integrates the research, design, construction, operation, life-cycle support, and disposal functions to successfully deliver an enduring nuclear power capability.    The highest priority for Naval Reactors is uncompromising and timely support for safe nuclear fleet operation. In FY 2016, $935 million funds the Base and supports the 96 operating reactors at sea on ships and at our training and research sites. The talented men and women, along with the equipment and facilities upon which they depend, stand ready and are called upon 24 hours per day, 365 days per year to advance the mission and respond to emergent fleet needs for assistance. The teams at Naval Reactors' four Program sites--the Bettis Laboratory in Pittsburgh, the Knolls Laboratory and Kesselring Site in greater Albany, and our spent nuclear fuel facilities in Idaho--perform the research and development, analysis, engineering and testing needed to support today's fleet and to develop future nuclear-powered warships. The teams in the Base provide tremendous value to the nation. Among the many examples of the work they do includes:    <bullet>  Adding more than 21 years of operational life across 14 LOS ANGELES-Class attack submarines.    <bullet>  Avoiding 14 years of lost aircraft carrier operational time and ensuring no impact to the deployment plan.    Over the past six years, Congress reduced Naval Reactors' funding by more than $600M. These reduced funding levels have substantially impacted plans to recapitalize the spent fuel handling infrastructure, advanced technology development, and maintenance on prototype reactors, facilities and infrastructure. These functional areas are foundational to the Program and support Naval Reactors' ability to sustain the current nuclear-powered fleet and develop the future fleet.    Mr. Rogers. Mr. Whitney, please explain the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) Fund. Why is $472 million being requested for the Federal Government's portion of this fund when the reauthorization for collection of the nuclear power industry's portion has not been passed?    Mr. Rogers. Mr. Whitney, is EM on track to meet its regulatory and compliance agreements for FY15? What about for FY16 and beyond?    Mr. Rogers. Ms. Roberson, DNFSB sent a letter to DOE last year recommending improvements to DOE's emergency response programs. What are the specific concerns you outlined in that recommendation? What specific steps would DNFSB like to see taken by DOE to improve in this area?    Mr. Rogers. Ms. Roberson, is the DNFSB preparing an implementation plan to address the recommendations and corrective actions within the LMI study on DNFSB's workforce and culture? When will this plan be complete?    Mr. Rogers. Ms. Roberson, does DNFSB intend to review NNSA's large list of deferred maintenance projects for safety risks? Would DNFSB be willing to provide NNSA its views on prioritizing this list with regards to safety risk?    Mr. Rogers. Ms. Roberson, what are the safety impacts of NNSA's deteriorating infrastructure and $3.6 billion backlog of deferred maintenance? NNSA officials have said that ``infrastructure risk becomes safety risk.'' Do you agree?
