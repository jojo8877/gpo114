    Mr. Green. Mr. Chairman, I was glad our vice chair of the subcommittee worried about our pets. My problem is I had a dog one time that ate pillows and curtains and everything else. I think he ate everything he could get his mouth on.    Mr. Chairman, I have a statement I would like to put into the record, but I would like to yield my time to Congressman Butterfield.    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to thank our witnesses testifying today on GMOs.    Dr. Giddings, one of my concerns, are you aware of any instance where a GMO crop caused an adverse impact on human or animal health? And, frankly, why don't we start with you and we can go down the list.    Mr. Green. Mr. Jaffe?    Mr. Green. Would the bill that we are discussing today correct that with the authority given?    Mr. Green. OK. Mr. Reifsteck?    Mr. Green. Mr. Daloz, anything to offer from the Attorney General's Office?    Mr. Green. Mr. Blasgen?    Mr. Green. Mr. Giddings, are you aware of a situation where an unknown consumption of GMO in grain has caused adverse health reaction? Again, to all five of our witnesses.    Mr. Green. And I know the concerns, and I think the legislation would probably would move it forward to help with some certainty including FDA oversight.    One of my other questions, Mr. Reifsteck, and can you explain how the state-by-state patchwork would affect farmers and co-ops, and also Mr. Blasgen, then I will start with Mr. Reifsteck first.    Mr. Green. It would seem to be the same thing on the labeling, because I don't think we will ever have 50 different labeling requirements, but if two or three states do it, then, really that shows we need a national standard.    Mr. Green. OK. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. Appreciate it.
