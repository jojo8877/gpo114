    Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank you all for being here to give us an update. As the Chairman said in his comments, this is something we have followed, will continue to follow, and do appropriate oversight with you. We are so focused on your funding mechanism, how you moved to self-funding after that initial tranche of money is exhausted, and then how you are going to see that business model developing.    Also, the issue of interoperability, those of us that have worked through the issues of some of our natural disasters want to make certain that that is being addressed, and that the stakeholders, with all of the first responders across the country, are going to understand, participate, and that we are going to realize this objective of having something that is interoperable.    The other thing I want to touch on, and I will get to this in my questions a bit more, the aspects of a secure network. We are realizing more and more the importance of having a secure network, and, of course, we realize, closed systems, we are going to deal with those one way, enterprise systems another way. When you look at something that meets the interoperability component that you are going to have, the security of the system is just so important to us.    We are living in an age where we face cyberattacks not just on a monthly basis, a weekly basis, but an hourly basis. So please talk with us about this issue of security. It is a heightened concern for us as we move into the age of the Internet of everything, and look at 50 billion devices being attached by the time we get to the end of this decade. So that secure wireless network that is the goal, we want to be certain that indeed it is secure, and hear from you as much as you can divulge to us that--how you are achieving that.    With that, I will yield the balance of my time to anyone who is seeking time. No takers? Time goes back----    Mrs. Blackburn . To Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
