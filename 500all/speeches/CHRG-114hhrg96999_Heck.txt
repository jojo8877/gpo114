    Mr. Heck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Johnson, for you, sir--and I apologize for not having been here earlier if some of my inquiries are a bit redundant. Please accept my apologies.    But I do understand you to have said in response to a question earlier today that you found much merit, or at least some considerable merit, in Mr. Hoenig's approach of making these determinations on the basis of the level of risk activity as opposed to just asset size. Is that correct?    Mr. Heck. And is there any point at which that size matters if the risk activity continues to be de minimis? And if so, what would you indicate as the appropriate size?    Mr. Heck. The bottom line being, if I am hearing you correctly, that you and I would agree that some form of regulatory relief geared toward lower-risk-activity institutions of a certain size would be appropriate and a prudent thing to do.    Mr. Heck. I am going to go off-topic a little bit here, but I cannot resist the impulse, given your professional background at the IMF.    Is the United States paying a price, directly or indirectly, for our failure to embrace the recommended reforms of, what now, 5 years ago? And if so, what do you think they are?    Mr. Heck. To the IMF.    Mr. Heck. Dr. Johnson, do you believe our failure to embrace those reforms, as are supported pretty much throughout the rest of the globe by the participants, cedes economic development leadership in the world to other countries? Are we giving up influence, gravitas, opportunity to make a positive impact to other countries by virtue of our unwillingness to adopt these--    Mr. Heck. All I can say is ``hear, hear'' on both points. Thank you very much, sir.
