    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Like the Judge, I too am deeply offended that North Korea has called out my constituents in the State of Hawaii, placing us in their crosshairs. Understanding that with what is happening in the region this is actually something that is top of mind for people, something that is very real. So as you look at the growing threats across the world, both conventional and unconventional, I appreciate your leadership and the ranking member's leadership, and continuing to hold the line and maintain this pressure on North Korea as they openly continue to develop their ballistic missile capabilities, and their nuclear capabilities, understanding that that consistency and that increased pressure is necessary if we want this to have a very real effect. Again, my constituents in Hawaii and others in the Asia-Pacific Region are acutely aware of what North Korea is doing on the one hand, and what we are doing to stop them. Thank you very much.
