    Mr. Weber. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And Dr.--is it Dinan?    Mr. Weber. Dinan. They've been ignoring you, and so I just wanted to come to you. I'm going to have a question for all five of you, and it's a simple yes or no. And I don't want you to give away the answer. Just do you know the answer? MTBE, do you know what that is?    Mr. Weber. Mr. Anderson, since you run some Wendy's franchises, you may or may not know what that is.    Mr. Weber. Okay. And is it Dr. DeCicco?    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. All right. Mr. Coleman?    Mr. Weber. Okay. Dr. Drevna?    Mr. Weber. Okay. So this is a push to do away with MTBE, a.k.a. methyl tertiary butyl ether, as I understand it, ostensibly because MTBE was found in groundwater, is that right, any of y'all? Dr. Drevna?    Mr. Weber. Okay. Do we know what affect ethanol has in the groundwater?    Mr. Weber. So according to Wikipedia--standby, Mr. Coleman, I'll come to you----    Mr. Weber. --MTBE was not very soluble in water.    Mr. Weber. It's very soluble in water?    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. And so ethanol is but you said it separates out quicker.    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. So----    Mr. Weber. That's because it's corrosive to the inside of a steel engine, is that correct?    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. Okay. Mr. Coleman, you wanted to weigh in.    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. Mr. Drevna, you had another--or Dr.----    Mr. Weber. Well, we've had another--in the committee that I chair, the Energy Subcommittee, we've had a group of--a gas station owned by farmers in Ohio area, I think, or maybe it was Iowa--I'd have to go back and look--who actually couldn't sell enough of this stuff in the very heart of corn country. So from an economic standpoint, it just wasn't really flying.    Mr. Weber. Sure.    Mr. Weber. Well, if we have a difference of opinion, that's not an attack, right?    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. So you'd be happy to counterattack?    Mr. Weber. Okay. All right. Well, I'm going to leave it at that. Mr. Chairman, I'm going to yield back.
