    Mr. Perry. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ambassador Olson, to what extent is Iran a player in Afghanistan affairs? If you can inform us on the policy tools that Tehran employs to further its goals in Afghanistan and elucidate those goals in particular, what their presence is in Iran, and whether they supply assistance or support for the insurgent groups in Afghanistan and to what extent?    Mr. Perry. So then is it kind of your feeling or your testimony that they don't supply assistance to insurgent groups, or do they? Maybe you need to define or I need to define what we would consider an insurgent group in the context of that discussion, that question.    Mr. Perry. Do you consider the Taliban an insurgent group?    Mr. Perry. Are you saying right now that they are not supporting the Taliban but just considering it?    Mr. Perry. So how actively are you monitoring their conversations with the Taliban or would-be conversations? Are they having conversations, and are they materially supplying currently, or is that stuff that you cannot discuss in this forum?    Mr. Perry. All right. I got it. Moving on quickly. The President, Ashraf Ghani, recently threatened to file a complaint with the U.N. Security Council if Pakistan failed to take military action against Taliban leaders operating within Pakistan. The question is, what is Pakistan doing to pressure the Afghan Taliban to come to the negotiating table, and how has Pakistan used its influenced with the Afghan Taliban to bring a reduction in violence to Afghanistan? And have we specifically asked Pakistan to do this with regard to exerting its influence on the Afghan Taliban?    Mr. Perry. Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back.
