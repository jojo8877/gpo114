    Ms. DelBene. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thanks to all of you for being here with us today.    Mr. Misener, I wanted to follow up on the opinion on Amazon's application for .AMAZON. It seems like it has basically been a draw at this point. The opinion found there wasn't a basis for ICANN to turn down your application but also found that Amazon didn't have a clear right to have its application granted. So I wondered if you could explain for the Committee the process that you went through and what information was made available concerning ICANN's decision-making process for you, and kind of what comes next.    Ms. DelBene. And so what comes next now on your side?    Ms. DelBene. Thank you.    Ms. DelBene. Ms. Stark, I understand that part of the process for launching the new gTLDs is that ICANN established a committee of trademark law experts that made recommendations for stronger and more efficient protection of trademarks, and that many of their recommendations were adopted by ICANN, including a newer, faster, and cheaper procedure to take down a domain name that is violating a trademark owner's rights.    Can you compare what happened there and contrast that with how things existed in the .com regime, and provide any examples for the Committee of instances where a domain name was taken down based on those rules?    Ms. DelBene. So do you think we have the right process in place, or what do you think we should do differently based on your learning now as we look towards----    Ms. DelBene. Thank you.    My time has expired. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
