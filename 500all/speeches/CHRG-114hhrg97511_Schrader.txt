    Mr. Schrader. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess for Dr. Wootan and Ms. Raskopf, these rules, actually to everybody, obviously, this rule is not ready for prime time. We have had considerable discussion about what it is going to do, how it would be implemented. I understand that. And, you know, although the rules have come out, it is my understanding that, you know, there has not been a whole lot of guidance going on.    And some of you already addressed this, some of us sent a letter asking for a little bit of a delay to, hopefully, iron out, get some more guidance before we went prime. I am grateful for this hearing and actually for this bill so that we can look at what options we may have to make this actually reasonable and work. Because I think, like everybody has testified, we want to actually have good information out there for our consumers. I think that is good.    But I am curious, I ask, I guess, Ms. Raskopf and Dr. Wootan, do you think a little bit more time is needed? Or is this, should we just get to it and do up and down votes on this type of legislation.    Mr. Schrader. Dr. Wootan?    Mr. Schrader. I appreciate that. Mr. Chairman, I ask that the letter that a lot of Senators, Representatives, put in be a matter of the record, if that is all right, sir.    Mr. Schrader. Just a last question, I guess, for maybe Ms. Liddle. Other states have gone their own way on this and already, as we have heard, implemented labeling requirements for convenience stores, grocery stores, everything. So how are you, how have you dealt with that so far? And isn't there an opportunity maybe with some sort of Federal, hope a better Federal guideline to make it easier for you guys to compete in different venues across the country?    Mr. Schrader. OK very good. With that, I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
