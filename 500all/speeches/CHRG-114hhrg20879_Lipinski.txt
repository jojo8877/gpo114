    Mr. Lipinski. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much for stalling there for a second. I was at another hearing. I just finished my questioning there, so I thank the witnesses for being here today.    And this may be a little bit of a repeat and that's what we're trying to avoid here, but I wanted to make sure that I directly had you address some of these things. Dr. Hallinan, the Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee, BESAC, recently released a report detailing which BES upgrade proposals should be prioritized, and I was pleased that BESAC recommended beginning construction on the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab, which is located in my district.    It's my understanding that your research has relied on APS, so could you talk a bit about your work that uses the APS and how upgrading it would advance both your research in the field of high-energy light source research in general?    Mr. Lipinski. Yes. What about the--in general the impact on international competitiveness for the U.S. to do this upgrading?    Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. One other question I want to throw out there, I know you talked already about energy storage. JCESR is also centered at Argonne. Is the Energy Innovation Hub model the best way to pursue this type of research and other research? I just want to get a reaction to that if that's the best way to do this and to continue on with other research challenges that we face?    Mr. Lipinski. My time is expired so I will yield back. Thank you.
