    Mr. Murphy (continuing). Colorado, of course, and see what else is going on.    I want to thank this panel. We will follow up with the questions because we heard a number of recommendations from you, so we will ask for more clarifications of this.    Look, I want to thank you. As I said last time, too, you know, if this was about a single airplane crash, this room would be filled with media. But we have had more people die in the last year from drug overdose deaths than the combination of every airplane crash in North America from 1975 to the present. And we have to make sure we keep this on the front page. This is a serious crisis and one, whether it's education of physicians, mandatory education, whether it's options out there, we want to make sure the evidence-based care and that Federal funding is going in the right direction.    So I'd like to thank all the witnesses and members that participated in today's hearing.    I remind members they have 10 business days to submit questions for the record, and I ask that all the witnesses agree to respond promptly to the questions.    With that, this committee is adjourned. Thank you.
