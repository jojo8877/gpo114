    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I appreciate the service that you all provide to our country.    And, Admiral Gortney, I hope you brought some of the great weather they have been having in Colorado Springs to the east coast here.    Mr. Lamborn. The forecast I see for next week is in the 60s and sunshine.    Admiral Gortney, we touched on the long-range discriminating radar. But could you amplify the importance of that for the warfighter.    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.    Admiral Syring, on the issue of space, can you discuss your current and future space architecture needs and plans.    Mr. Lamborn. Well, that is very encouraging.    But, also, let me ask you about something we have talked about in my office privately: directed energy. That is something--there is a bipartisan agreement that that has tremendous potential for the future and is and should be part of our asymmetrical advantage as a country over people on the other side.    So what are you doing to apply the benefits of directed energy?    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.    And, lastly, Admiral Gortney, I will finish up by asking you about the cruise missile threat. I know on all these things we can get into more of the weeds in the classified session.    But, in general terms, what is the threat that we are looking at against the homeland today?    Mr. Lamborn. Well, thank you again for the work that you do.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
