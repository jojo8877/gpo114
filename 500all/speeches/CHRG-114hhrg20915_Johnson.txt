    Ms. Johnson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Let me welcome the witnesses, and I'm pleased to see that Dr. Volz and Dr. Powner are here again to provide updates on our nation's critical weather satellite development programs, JPSS and GOES-R. I am looking forward to hearing from both of you and Mr. Stoffler and Ms. Chaplain about the relationship between the Department of Defense and NOAA and how that partnership helps meet both civilian and defense needs.    I want to be clear that NOAA's weather satellite programs play a critical role in ensuring the continued health of our weather forecasting capabilities, and they support weather forecasting activities around the globe. Although both JPSS and GOES-R has experienced significant cost growth and management and technical challenges during this development, I am pleased to learn that NOAA has responded to recommendations from GAO and others and that we expect to have both satellites launched within the year.    However, as we will hear today, there is still more work to be done. Concerns about a potential gap in our satellite coverage must be addressed and NOAA must apply lessons learned to ensure future programs do not face identical challenges.    As I've said before, we must take all necessary steps to ensure that there is not a gap in satellite coverage in support of our weather forecasting capabilities. The successful launch of these satellites is critical to ensure our nation maintains its weather forecasting capabilities. However, it represents the first step, not the last in NOAA's ever-evolving efforts to protect American lives, property, and critical infrastructure.    I look forward to hearing more about NOAA's plans to maintain and improve the Nation's weather forecasting capabilities. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding the hearing, and I yield back the balance of my time.
