    Mr. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.    Dr. Lewis, you pointed out that your lab has demonstrated a functional solar fuel system. Can you elaborate on the fundamental chemistry and materials research needed to discover new molecules and materials and why that research is needed if you have already demonstrated at least one version of a solar fuel system?    Mr. Brooks. Okay. A follow-up in that regard, has the Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office provided adequate support for transitional or early-stage research and development for artificial photosynthesis or for that matter a functional solar fuel system?    Mr. Brooks. All right. This next question will be for each of you, and we'll start with Dr. Hallinan and move to my left, your right. How is the United States faring against international competition in foundational energy research? And each of you have talked about different subject matter, so if we could, your answer be directed to your areas of expertise. Dr. Hallinan?    Mr. Brooks. Thank you.    Mr. Brooks. I don't know if the Chair will permit, but I've got two more witnesses. Can they respond?    Mr. Brooks. Dr. Scherson?    Mr. Brooks. Dr. Lewis?    Mr. Brooks. Thank you for your insight.
