    Mr. Pittenger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chair Matz, I would like to kind up pick up on that. In 2014, and again on July 20, 2015, the former chairman of this committee, Barney Frank, an author of the Dodd-Frank bill, stated that he did not believe that asset managers should be regulated as SIFIs. Would you state your perspective then on why you believe that they should be?    Mr. Pittenger. Do you believe they are systemically risky?    Mr. Pittenger. Do you believe that asset managers are systemically risky? And if so, how?    Mr. Pittenger. Can you name any specific asset managers that you believe are of concern to you as chairman of NCUA?    Mr. Pittenger. But you can't?    Mr. Pittenger. Systemic risk--    Mr. Pittenger. --to the financial system in this country. Can you name any?    Mr. Pittenger. We received testimony, this committee did, that the SIFI designation for asset managers would result in $100,000 in cost to each investor. Are you aware of that?    Mr. Pittenger. But that is where you are probing. That is what is on your radar screen. Do you believe that any action taken by FSOC to designate asset managers and their activities systemically important would be consistent with the congressional intent of Dodd-Frank?    Mr. Pittenger. Chair Matz, what do you understand is the business of an asset manager? Would you explain to me their business?    Mr. Pittenger. All right. They have the obligation to their clients to invest, is that right?    Mr. Pittenger. And these are owned by the clients, they are third-party custodians?    Mr. Pittenger. They have contractual obligations. They are advisers, and they are agents, aren't they?    Mr. Pittenger. They are advisors, and they are agents on behalf of their clients. Is that correct?    Mr. Pittenger. I think it is important to note that these managers don't also employ the balance sheet leverage. Is that correct?    Mr. Pittenger. Thank you. I yield back.
