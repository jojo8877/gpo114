    Mr. Barletta. Thank you, Madam Chairman.    Dr. Bucci, in your testimony you cite to 2012 GAO testimony and a 2011 GAO testimony report that found that only roughly half of the 36 countries in the Visa Waiver Program at that time were participating in the information-sharing agreements as they pertain to terrorist watch lists or crime. Now, I know these figures have reportedly improved. Do you know how many there are now?    Mr. Barletta. But not all to the level where we are satisfied that they are sharing all of the information?    Mr. Barletta. So I guess Mr. Jenkins talked about the number of European fighters; that they are increasing as we speak. So why would we, or should we--why would we or should we allow any country to participate or not remove a country from the list who are not sharing the information to the level that we are satisfied with the threat to the United States? As we talk with so many European foreign fighters now being--joining ISIS, why would we not remove them or allow them to continue to participate until they do what we need?    Mr. Barletta. A July 2013 GAO report revealed that DHS has lost track of over 1 million foreign visitors to the United States.    Mr. Frey, what mechanisms does the Visa Waiver Program have in place to ensure that individuals who enter the United States under the program leave when they are supposed to?    Mr. Barletta. How would we know that?    Mr. Barletta. That is great. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
