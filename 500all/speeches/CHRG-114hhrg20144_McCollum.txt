    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.                    Opening Remarks of Ms. McCollum    I also would like to welcome Director Ashe to the subcommittee this morning. Thank you for being here.    And I would like to extend my congratulations to National Wildlife Refuge System, which yesterday celebrated 113 years of wildlife conservation. Happy birthday. Happy anniversary. Congratulations.    This year, Fish and Wildlife Service has some great accomplishments to celebrate. The Yellowstone grizzly bear has been successfully recovered and proposed for delisting. The Monarch butterfly population grew 255 percent, showing signs of effective conservation efforts with our partners.    You engaged everyone in the United States for Monarch protection, and it is working.    Sadly, however, the Service also faced challenges. This January, as the chair pointed out, armed occupiers took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, keeping dedicated employees from carrying out their mission. There should be no tolerance for threats of violence and intimidation against public servants who are the conservators of America's nature, or denial of the opportunity for any citizen to safely enjoy America's public lands and waters.    As was pointed out by the chair, you are much appreciated and respected in that part of Oregon. You did have your neighbors stand up and say enough is enough.    The fiscal year 2017 Fish and Wildlife Service budget requests a modest increase to expand opportunities to experience nature and rebuild urban areas, and to rebuild capacity and make targeted increases to address some of the Service's most pressing challenges.    The budget increased support for the National Wildlife Refuge System by $25 million, of which $2 million will be going toward refuge law enforcement, adding much-needed Federal wildlife officers to protect visitors, staff, and our natural resources. Another $5 million will increase support for refuge maintenance.    The Fish and Wildlife Service has been working for several years to bring down its maintenance backlog, and this increase will continue momentum to relieve some of the strains on their facilities.    I am particularly interested in the $6 million increase for the Urban Wildlife Conservation Program. Urban refuges are the most important part of youth engagement, serving as an outdoor classroom for thousands of children. Over 80 percent of Americans live in cities, so it is essential that our youth engagement initiatives, such as the Urban Wildlife Refuge Partners, connect those children with wildlife and nature so that they become the next generation of good stewards of this land.    There is also a growing body of scientific research that finds a connection between nature experiences and public health, such as reduced stress and improved physical and mental wellness. Americans of every age can benefit from this proposed investment in healthy ecosystems.    Additionally, the budget combats invasive species, builds on science programs, works to build more collaborative efforts with partners, and provides appropriate resources to make timely listing determinations, process permits, and expedite project reviews to avoid delays, which could negatively impact economic growth and job creation.    I am also pleased that the service is proposing increases for the State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program. States are important partners, and these funds support their conservation and management of wildlife and habitat.    This budget request is reasonable, and it will move the Fish and Wildlife Service toward meeting its commitment to preserve and protect our living natural resources.    Director Ashe, thank you for the work you do. Thank you to all the employees of the Fish and Wildlife Service for all that you do for all of us here.    So thank you for your testimony. I look forward to hearing it.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    Ms. McCollum. Mr. Chair, I would like to yield at this time to Ms. Pingree from Maine.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for the courtesy of allowing two of our members who had hearings at 10:30 to go first with their questions.    If we can have a second round, I will just do one question now, so your members can also ask theirs.    We have talked a lot about endangered species, protected species, and now let us round it off with invasive species.    The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has reported over 60 captures of invasive Asian carp in Minnesota's portion of the Mississippi River since 2008. Last year, the furthest upstream catch was made on the St. Croix River near Stillwater. As you know, we have a lot of confluence between our rivers in Minnesota and our waterways.    Minnesota waterways support a fishing industry that generates $2.4 billion a year and provides 35,000 Minnesota jobs. So we are very concerned about the impacts of carp on clean water, healthy ecosystems, outdoor recreation and fisheries. All of that is essential in Minnesota.    In fact, our Governor recently held a water summit, which was broadly attended in Minnesota, and part of what our DNR did was a breakout session on invasive species and its effect on Minnesota waters.    So, Director Ashe, I would like to get a little bit of an update from you on how the Fish and Wildlife Service is leveraging funds with USGS and other Federal, State, and local governments. As you know, Mr. Joyce and I, along with many, many other people who care about this issue thought U.S. Fish and Wildlife, because of the way in which you collaborate and leverage such good work, would be the appropriate lead agency on this.    Two other things I would like you to follow up on. eDNA was very, very controversial in its early stages. eDNA would have indicated carp was already in the upper areas of the Mississippi River, because of fish droppings and other such things. I know you were working with the scientists on developing better markers with eDNA. If you have any update on that now or if you could get it to our office later, that would be great.    Then could you update us as to your research collaborations and what is going on with electronic sensors, biological controls, acoustic deterrents, as well as planting trackers on some of the carp so that you can better understand their habitat? I am intrigued by this whole idea of using the markers to track, so we learn more about the fish.    I think it is something USGS and Fish and Wildlife are working on in the Everglades with the pythons, too.    If you can stay a little more focused on Asian carp, the chair and I will go look at pythons later ourselves.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. McCollum. Mr. Chairman, there is also the issue of having who we need to have at our Customs and airport entries here. I am very concerned that we have not put enough resources or efforts into that with Homeland Security.    There are different kinds of trafficking, because there is also the illegal trafficking, bringing in invasive species.    Mr. Ashe, if you could, maybe point out how underresourced and how overworked some of U.S. Customs and Border folks are right here in the United States.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    I think I am going to give you something else to be a little frustrated by.    As part of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement, BP agreed to pay $100 million to the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund for grants focused on wetland restoration and conservation. I think that is a good thing.    Ms. McCollum. However, the settlement did not include any administrative set-aside for the work that you do at Fish and Wildlife. So that means additional funding out of our committee, out of the general U.S. taxpayer fund, is required for you to be able to conduct your duties.    From my conversations with you, that includes everything from some basic planning to getting a scientist in place because the travel comes out of administrative funds.    Director Ashe, rightly so, you want to make this work, you want to make the restoration work, but there has been no set-aside in the settlement, so you are, in my opinion, forced to include $4 million for the Gulf restoration program out of your budget. You are forgoing other choices that you might want to make in helping my friends from the Western States with some of their challenges, or working on invasive species, or many of the other projects that you might have on a backlog list.    Could you please, for the committee, be clear on why this funding is needed; what it will allow the service to do to expedite, efficiently and properly, the $100 million that has been set aside for cleanup; and tell us what we forgo in U.S. Fish and Wildlife priorities that this committee is trying to set? Some of it is our own doing with some of our colleagues thinking that they were being tough on administrative costs, so we were shortsighted with some of our colleagues passing legislation.    The other issue is an interpretation, perhaps. Maybe we should go back and talk to the Justice Department as to conversations that were had to make sure that judicial and legislative intent is clear on what monies should be used for this restoration.    Ms. McCollum. Mr. Chair, I think sometimes when people are talking about administrative costs, it is a very abstract thing. Some of our colleagues to go down on the floor and say, we are just going to cut administrative costs. Sometimes there are things that we will see in a budget administratively and we think you can do that later, or you can postpone that.    But this is a very different type of administrative cost. So, Mr. Chair, if Fish and Wildlife could tell us with more in-depth clarity some of the things that are going to be done under this administrative cost, which just allows a project to go forward, it is something we need to talk to our colleagues on the floor about amending in the RESTORE Act to see if we can provide some relief on that.    I am going to be trying to explore with the Justice Department just exactly what the conversations were, and their definition of administrative costs. Mr. Chair, if we do not get this solved, one, Fish and Wildlife goes shortchanged on other projects that the American public would like to see move forward; and two, I do not think it was ever the expectation for U.S. taxpayer dollars to basically now be paying for cleanup of the Gulf BP spill.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Director Jarvis, thank you for joining us here today. The National Parks represent our country's collective decision to preserve and celebrate America's natural wonders and cultural heritage.    This year, with the National Park Service Centennial, America's commitment and fascination with its parks are at an all-time high. Last year, over 307 million people visited our national parks.    The fiscal year 2017 budget request reaffirms this commitment and makes the necessary investments to preserve these special places. As part of the Centennial Initiative, the budget proposes $560 million to strengthen the foundation for visitor services and make essential infrastructure improvements.    I am pleased to see that the Centennial Initiative continues to emphasize youth engagement. The budget increases support for the Every Kid in a Park program by $20 million. Youth engagement initiatives such as this one truly offer a return on investment as these important educational opportunities help build the future stewards of our national treasures and our natural resources.    The budget also includes a $151 million increase to address high-priority deferred maintenance needs across the National Park system. The National Park Service has a significant problem in meeting its maintenance needs.    Currently, 60 percent of the service's highest priority, nontransportation assets have deferred maintenance needs. We must invest in the repair and maintenance of these assets to ensure we can protect the natural and cultural resources in our over 400 park units.    There is also a tremendous need to address the critical maintenance backlog for the service transportation assets. Just this month, reports came out that the Memorial Bridge here in Washington, D.C., is deteriorating so quickly that it will be closed to vehicle traffic in 5 years. While funding for the park service transportation assets is provided through the THUD Subcommittee, I want to emphasize how critical these funds are to the preservation and public enjoyment of our national parks.    Finally, I have to express my disappointment with the administration's failure to request funding for the Save America's Treasures program. The Save America's Treasures program began in 1999 and has been instrumental in partnering with others--local municipalities and cities and nonprofits--to protect cultural resources that were almost lost.    Let me give you two examples right here in Washington. The program helped to restore the Star-Spangled Banner flag, which people from all over the world and all over this country go and visit, and the Wright Flyer III, the world's first practical airplane.    The program is aptly named Save America's Treasures because that is exactly what it does. So I hope next year, the budget request will include funding for this important program.    We have a national parks system because we had people in the past who had the vision and courage to work to set aside these special places and preserve them for generations to come. Our responsibility today is caring for America's historical, cultural, and natural treasures, and it is an ongoing responsibility.    The American people are looking to us to take that responsibility seriously, to make the investments and the partnerships to protect and preserve them for the next 100 years and beyond.    So, Director Jarvis, I appreciate the work that you and all the employees of the National Park Service do for us every day, and I look forward to your testimony.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    I was at Theodore Roosevelt park at one of the observation areas, and a bus pulled up and unloaded all of its trash at the park. I think the folks at the park expected it to happen, because they were out there shortly after. The bins were overflowing. There was trash all over. That was not even from the regular park-goers who might purchase something and then want to dispose of it, or a family having a picnic that they were bringing to one of the picnic tables at one of the outlooks.    I was just aghast. I wanted to say something, but I did not know what I would say.    I am sure this happens all across our national parks. Any other business, any other nonprofit, that was absorbing things like that would be trying to reduce waste in the stream.    I have two things I would like to follow up on. I will bring both of them forward, Mr. Jarvis, and then you can respond.    I mentioned earlier that the budget request does not have any dollars going toward Save America's Treasures. Our treasures are vanishing. This is a program that has not received any funding since 2010, yet I know that the park service at times has benefited from this program. It helps us tell the story of how important it is to save our treasures, our cultural treasures.    I know it is not in the President's budget, but if you would, please enlighten the committee on some of the work that it has done.    I am pleased, though, that the budget has $25 million in it for competitive civil rights grants--though those also would have been opportunities to use Save America's Treasures for civil rights grants. As we see more opportunities coming forward for historic preservation, it is good that we have the civil rights grants available now. But those would have been projects that could have been eligible for Save America's Treasures and could be in the future.    There is also a proposal for $3 million in grants to renovate historically black colleges and universities, which I think is critically important. A lot of people in the public might wonder why we have something in our budget for colleges and universities.    So, if you could, please address those three issues for me in a little greater detail.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. McCollum. I have two.    First reading the newspaper a while ago, I read the Federal Government is currently involved in an outrageous lawsuit over naming rights at Yosemite Park. It just took my breath away.    My understanding is the corporation that formerly held the park's concession contract is trying to claim trademark rights in the names associated with a national park.    To me, it sounds like they are mad that their concession contract did not go the way they wanted it to. To me, it is extortion of the American taxpayer.    I am distressed that the National Park Service is changing the name of five of the park's attractions. If you could, tell me why did the Service feel it had to rename those attractions?    This has a ripple effect with local businesses that rely on this to sell visitor guides and souvenirs. When Voyageurs National Park was going forward, that was one of the things that we told communities, that they can be part of successful economic opportunities being adjacent to a park.    What steps is the National Park Service taking to make sure that does not happen again? And then after you answer that, I have one other question I would like to ask.    Ms. McCollum. I would be happy to.    Ms. McCollum. I imagine you are.    Ms. McCollum. I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Idaho.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Before I ask my second question, was it $51 million that they were asking--I am going to say trying to extort--from the Park Service? That is my term, not yours.    Ms. McCollum. It sounds like blackmail to me.    Moving on, we were talking about acquisitions and how careful you are when you are looking at making acquisitions to our national park system. The budget does include a significant land acquisitions request for $22.5 million to purchase 640 acres of state-owned land in the Grand Teton National Park.    The size of the project is somewhat unusual. I think I understand it pretty well. As we move forward, putting the budget together, could you please explain for us why this purchase is so large? Is it scalable at all? The project will require a match, assuming funds are appropriated. What happens to that parcel of land if you are unable to raise the matching funds necessary to complete the purchase?    What happens if the State of Wyoming does not extend the date by which the sale must be completed? You are running into a potential problem if we are not getting things done on time, even if it is in our proposed budget to go to conference and get to the President's desk. Can you explain how sensitive this timeline is?    Ms. McCollum. Mr. Chair, there are some things that are even beyond our control. We would like to see everything done, as Chairman Rogers has said, in regular order and in good time. But there are some conversations that we might need to have. If this becomes a priority, if this committee and the Senate are in agreement on it, and it looks like something that would be included, we might be able to have conversations with the State of Wyoming to figure out if there is some way we can work with the Governor or the legislature there in extending that deadline for moving forward.    From what I am hearing from you, there is our decision as legislators and appropriators whether or not this becomes something we fund on the priority list. It is something that I support. And then if it looks like we are not going to be able to get things done in regular order, we have to figure out how we have those conversations with the State of Wyoming on this.    So, thank you, Mr. Chair.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Assistant Secretary Roberts. I join the Subcommittee Chairman in welcoming you to the committee. Thank you to the other witnesses who are here as well.    This Subcommittee is united in its commitment to the social and economic wellbeing of Native Americans, so I am pleased that the President's budget in 2017 proposes investments to better address Native American issues and needs, both in their communities and in their environment. I do support the President's budget. Some of the initiatives that the President has proposed, well, I think the chairman is correct that they are not likely to see the light of day. But they are good to have in here, so that we can have a discussion on the way we move forward and invest in the United States of America and in Indian Country.    The budget expands the Administration's TIWAHE initiative which leverages BIA funds and other Federal programs to support families and communities' health in a culturally appropriate way. It increases this initiative by $17 million. In the discussions that we have had with youth who have been here about some of the challenges that they and their families face, what we heard about rising suicide rates among the very young in Indian Country makes these investments in tribes and tribal families and communities very important to me.    The budget also invests in tribal natural resources, supporting climate resilience, management, conservation, and utilization of reservation and water resources. The budget request advances Indian education by investing an additional $60 million in programs that support students from elementary through post-secondary education, and by providing $138 million to continue the robust education construction program that was enacted last year.    Together we are taking important steps to build towards a construction budget that is dedicated to repairing our schools and education facility replacement. These investments are a good start, but there is much more to be done.    Having said that, I have to admit I was appalled to learn that the Bureau of Indian Education is failing to conduct safety and health inspections for all of its schools. The Bureau of Indian Education is responsible for 48,000 Indian students and 183 campuses. Each and every one of those schools is supposed to be inspected annually, but GAO found last year that BIA failed to inspect 69 out of the 180 school locations. GAO also determined that 54 school locations have not been inspected in the past 4 years. So I am glad we are going to have another panel with GAO, because if there is something that needs to be repudiated on that, we need to know. But I was absolutely appalled reading that report.    On March 2nd, 2016, Secretary Jewell testified before this committee, and agreed that BIE schools were in a deplorable condition, and that we have a responsibility to provide these students with a safe learning environment. So it is unconscionable that, if true, the Bureau is not demanding full accountability from the inspection program because one of the most basic elements of children's safety is to be in a school facility that is safe. GAO's study shines a light on what I see as huge failures. We can and we must do better for those children. I know that will be a goal that we all share.    So, Mr. Chair, with that, I do not have anything more to add to an opening statement.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to talk about the decision that was made in this budget to cut law enforcement by $7 million and tribal justice support by $8 million. The majority of that funding goes directly to tribes to be used at a local level. Some tribal nation are on reservations that cover areas the size of a State. We are working to make VAWA a success in bringing to an end to violence against women. That is going to be an ongoing battle that we face. We are going to need ongoing support for tribes in doing that.    I have to believe that a cut of this size will be felt with impact. In fact, your budget states that increases to law enforcement funding have ``represented some of the best opportunities for BIA to strategically impact the allocation of public safety resources in Indian Country.''    So there must be a reason why you chose this cut. We need to understand it. We are going to be hearing public testimony from tribal nations over the next few days, and I know this is going to come up because it is coming up with me already. So could you address that?    Ms. McCollum. Thank you.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chair. One of the things that we have found, whether it is in recruiting healthcare employees or employees to deliver education, two issues keep coming up. Both the tribes raise them as well as conversations that I have had with people who might be looking at a career opportunity serving in Indian Country. One is a lack of housing.    Housing needs to be good for the people in the tribal nations. I want to make that very clear, and the roads need to be good for the people in the tribal nations. But the second issue is being able to recruit and hire permanent staff so there is consistency and continuity in care, continuity in education.    There are staff quarters at many locations, and when we talk to folks, they talk about the transportation issue, how far that they drive, and the condition of the roads. That also affects school transportation. Mr. Simpson is not here, but we have two different brands of fitness trackers that we wear to keep track of our activities, how much we are moving around during the day.    When we were in Navajo Country, Mike and I both noticed something. We laughed about it, but it really was not funny. We were on a school bus, and we both did 500 steps on each one of our different brands, so we knew that they tracked the same way. 500 steps sitting in a bus. Those are kids being jostled around every day, but that is also wear and tear on the equipment.    Can you talk about how the Administration is working on the Tribal Transportation Program, which is part of Fixing America's Surface Program? What are some of the things that we can be looking at to be more innovative for housing, whether it is rental or like some of the construction that they did on some of the military bases? If this is for staff, we can look at staff housing differently than we do the tribal nation members' housing perhaps, with the permission of that tribal nation and consultation with them.    So what are some of the ideas that you might have moving forward? Or if you can, get back to the committee with more information.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, with your indulgence, I want to go back to the school inspections just for a second. We are going to have another panel, and I want to be able to hear some of your thoughts on some of the questions that are going to be put to them.    In Minnesota we have the Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig School, the Bug School we call it on the reservation. Secretary Jewell visited that school, and, I mean, she saw deplorable conditions. It was never built to be a building to house students. It was built to be something that you put snowplows in and things like that. It was not for built for people.    There are dozens of school facilities in need of replacement literally all over Indian Country. That is why we increased the replacement construction funding, and you know the dollars: school replacement construction by $25 million, facility replacement by $12 million.    We understand that you are finally close to finalizing a new list of priority replacement schools, and I have to say, as Mr. Amodei was saying, sometimes this is agonizing. ``It will be next month,'' or, ``we are going to have it next week.'' So I am going to point blank ask you: when can this committee expect to see a list? Because we are getting ready to mark up our bill.    Now since the GAO report is out, there are two things I need to understand beyond the status of these school and facility replacement lists. Can you explain to us, as you went through developing this new list, how inspections were done? I am not saying you should throw out this list. Even if you answer in a way that does not make me happy or proud of the inspections done, we still need a list that we can start working off of. Then, we can figure out how to fix that list later.    Can you explain whether the inspection process for creating these two lists that you are going to be working off of was the same one that GAO evaluated? If it was not, can you please let this committee know how you went about developing the list? Our understanding--and Mr. Calvert and I and others serve on the Defense Committee--was that you were going to go through a review very similar to what the Department of Defense did, and that is why you brought someone in from DODEA.    Seriously, gentlemen, if you say we need to go back and do more due diligence, that is an okay answer. It is an acceptable answer because when we know we can do better, then we should do better. Or is this list the gold standard for how you are going to do inspections in the future?    Ms. McCollum. That is fair enough.    Ms. McCollum. Right.    Ms. McCollum. It was supposed to be temporary.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and as you rightly pointed out, this committee over the past 16 years has been working with due diligence with two Administrations. The Obama Administration only stepped up to the plate after problems were pointed out.    This is not blaming anybody who is up here trying to solve the problem. This is the result of decades and decades and decades of neglect and failure of the Federal government to live up to its obligations. Anybody who was listening at all today to the previous panel who were testifying, knows we are working together to solve this problem and this issue.    That having been said, GAO has been closely investigating what seems like the endless challenges of the Bureau of Indian Education and providing safe schools. Management issues and lack of accountability are recurring themes, and I believe that GAO's involvement has helped us to really put a spotlight on the reform that is needed.    I would like to thank you and your colleagues for doing this important investigation, and for valuable recommendations to help us on this committee as we are working with the BIE and working in partnership with tribal nations to address what needs to happen, because Indian students deserve a quality education. We must protect their rights to safe and healthy schools, not only so that they can succeed and so their nations succeed, but so that the United States of America can succeed in the future as well.    I look forward to discussing your findings in the spirit of cooperation and working with one and all to finally have a plan to bring this to an end. Thank you.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you. Not that this would be a good fit everywhere because of distance, but could a tribal nation work with a local fire department to come out and do fire safety inspections? Could the Bureau, for basic fire inspections, figure out some way to make that happen, so that at least at a minimum, fire inspections are taking place?    Ms. McCollum. Mr. Chair, we would have to work with the tribal nations and work with the Bureau on that, but that might be a quick way to do fire inspections, and the reimburse fire departments for travel. There are plenty of places we have been where there is not a local fire department nearby, but there were other places in Indian Country where you can see the fire station across the way.    That would not be for every safety inspection, but at a minimum to have fire, life, health, and safety, and occupancy inspections done. But that would have to be done in partnership, and it might not work everywhere.    What happens to a school when it cannot properly address these deficiencies? What steps should the BIE be taking to ensure that they do, and how is the tracking done? You have started doing these inspections. You turn them over. What has been the follow-up?    Ms. McCollum. Mr. Chair, I have been a schoolteacher in my past life, and I was in a building in North St. Paul that the fire marshal told the school district either replace it, or you have to cordon it off and not use certain classrooms anymore because they could not get folks out. It led the school district to have to pass a bond referendum to build a new high school. Part of the impetus of that was that the Minnesota fire inspector along with our local fire inspector finally said enough is enough.    The chairman was saying, we are going to work together, and I want to stress this. We have a willing partner in trying to fix this. But we have to have a plan to fix it, because as more of these inspections bring things to light, there is going to be more pent-up demand to do it right. We are not going to want these children to be sitting there waiting, once we identify the schools as unsafe.    I want to thank you for your work. Once again, to the people who were here earlier, this is something that everybody is working on together. But any inspector that did a drive-by inspection and said that was a good job is a person who needs to be held accountable. That is a person who needs to be, in my mind, disciplined for not doing their job properly, because that puts a bad reflection on every single Federal employee who is working so hard to solve this problem. It just paints everybody with a brush.    At a minimum these fire inspections and occupancy inspections need to be done. We need to figure out a way to make those happen, but we also need to know that when we get that report back, it is going to mean even more work for all of us to solve this problem. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Ms. McCollum. Mr. Chair, this goes to our institutional responsibility as the House of Representatives. I serve on the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee. That bill continues to cut GAO and CRS, which are direct extensions to our offices. It prohibits us from doing the oversight that we want to do, that we need to do. I think we need to start talking to our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, and our colleagues in general, as to how much not only have we cut our personal offices from being able to do things, but we have cut to the bone, GAO, and inspector general offices, and CRS. We will start making it impossible for us to do the great oversight that was done here today, so that we can work in partnership to solve problems and move things forward for taxpayers and for people who depend upon us to do our jobs right.    So, I want to thank you for the report, but I am sure that there are other things that GAO has been asked to do that they are not able to do because of cuts that have happened in the Legislative Branch appropriations over the past several years. I just wanted that on the record and out there.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your words of solidarity with the people in Belgium this morning. Terrible conversations parents are having with their children again as they find themselves under siege, so thank you for recognizing that tragedy. And we do need to stand together.    I would like to join Chairman Calvert in welcoming Administrator McCarthy to the Subcommittee. The Environmental Protection Agency was created to protect human health, the health of our environment, and to ensure clean air and clean water is there for our families and children.    In the 1970s, when communities across this Nation saw the effects of mass pollution on the rivers and in the skies, the EPA was a bipartisan solution to address this public health crisis.    I remember how excited both my Republican mother and Democratic father were that the Federal Government was working on this.    Because of the success of the EPA, today we often take for granted the quality of the water we drink from our taps and the air that we breathe.    This year, however, the critical need for the EPA once again was unmistakable. Our Nation watched a tragedy unfold in Flint, Michigan, where children were poisoned by the lead in their drinking water. The residents of Flint were betrayed by their State Government and, to this day, still do not have safe drinking water available from their taps.    The scandal shines a bright light on why it is necessary to have Federal protections for our environment, our water, and our public health. Critics often argue that States are the best able to regulate themselves, but Flint shows us that the Federal Government working with States has a role to play in protecting those communities.    And we here in Congress need to look at the underlying law to ensure that the EPA can step in--can step in--when a State is ignoring the public health of its residents, the United States of America's citizens.    Parents should be able to trust that their children are not being poisoned at school, at their places of worship, and especially in their own homes.    While the situation in Flint is unique because it was created by a State's failure to implement existing protections for its residents, the issue of aging water infrastructure and lead pipes is pervasive all across this country. It is time for us to have a serious discussion about infrastructure. It is unconscionable that in America, the richest country in the world, there are children whose physical and cognitive development is being harmed because they lack access to clean drinking water, which is a basic human right.    Now turning to the budget request, the President's fiscal year 2017 budget request includes $8.27 billion for the EPA. That amount is $127 million above the fiscal year 2016 enacted level.    The request includes increases for core programs, targeting resources toward those programs that matter most to public health and our environment. Unfortunately, I do not think the budget goes far enough.    The budget requests an additional $77 million for grants to support States and tribes so they can implement their environmental programs. However, this increase would not even bring the grants back to 2012 levels.    Furthermore, we all realize the Nation's water infrastructure is in crisis. Yet, sadly, the Clean Water Act State Revolving Fund, which is a major funding source for municipal water infrastructure projects, is slashed by $414 million.    I also must express my disappointment once again that the administration is proposing to cut $50 million from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has made measurable strides in protecting and restoring the Great Lakes ecosystem, but much more work needs to be done.    With the great unmet demand for both water infrastructure and restoration projects, I have to wonder if these cuts were proposed not on their merits but because the agency was trying to fulfill requests for other increases within their already terribly strained budget.    The SRF and the GLRI programs are among the few in EPA that have strong bipartisan support, so I will be working with Chairman Calvert to restore these cuts.    I only wish we could have the same kind of bipartisan support, though, to restore the cuts that the agency core operations have faced. For 5 years, the EPA has been under attack and its budget has been slashed. Opponents of the EPA view this as a victory, but the crisis in Flint, Michigan, shows what they really were: irresponsible cuts that jeopardize the EPA's ability to provide State oversight and protect public health.    I truly hope that something positive can come from this tragedy, and that it will inspire both sides of the aisle to come together, as we did in the creation of the EPA, and ensure proper funding for environmental regulations and for infrastructure so that no mother or father has to worry that the water that they are giving their baby is poisonous.    Administrator McCarthy, I really do appreciate the work that you and all the employees at the EPA do, and I look forward to your testimony.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    Ms. McCollum. You betcha. Ms. McCollum. She did. My father did not. Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would defer to my ranking member of the full Appropriations Committee for any questions she may have.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    About 9 months ago, Congressman Kildee approached me, and I am sure he approached others on this subcommittee, saying we need help from the EPA. I said we cannot do that. That is an earmark for Flint. We did some investigation and we found out that the Governor could have asked for funding directly and then that would not have been an earmark.    I have two little follow-ups on Flint, and then I want to get to another question.    You referenced 10 million miles of pipes, correct? But that is the public pipe. That is not the pipe that goes from where the right-of-way ends on a street into somebody's home. I have communities in my district, St. Paul and Stillwater, with older homes, and people are now paying a little more attention to make sure that they are testing for brass and lead.    As your budget has been cut over the years, how has that affected your ability to do not just a State audit, but an in-depth State audit--really dig in the way that you would like to? If you could just take a second to answer that, because I have another question.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you. I want to talk about a different kind of backlog, the abandoned mines issue. Last August, while you were investigating the Gold King mine, EPA caused an uncontrolled release that spilled contaminated water from a mine into Cement Creek, a tributary of the Animas River.    EPA's actions triggered these releases. However, I think it is really important to be clear that the EPA was only doing that work because it was stepping in to clean up an abandoned mine that had been polluting the area for decades. In fact, that mine was already releasing a steady stream of over 300 million gallons of contaminated water each year.    This country has a legacy of abandoned mines that pose safety risks to the public and leach pollutants that contaminate the soil and water. The universe of abandoned mines is huge. In Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico alone, there are at least 44,000 abandoned mines with no one to hold liable. It falls on the taxpayer to pay for the cleanup for these mines. They mine their profits; they close up their mines; and they have left.    As you are dealing with these issues that we are talking about today with Flint, you also have a role in cleaning up pollution from abandoned mines. How many abandoned mines is the EPA currently working on? What has the EPA been doing for the Navajo Nation to ensure that their water is properly monitored? How much assistance, monetary and technical, has the EPA been giving?    And if I might add, while we are cleaning up these legacy mine pollution issues, what is EPA doing to make sure that we do not create another legacy of polluted mines?    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I was going to ask another question, and I really would like to get that in after this, but right now I want to follow up on what Chairman Rogers was saying.    In my own congressional district in St. Paul, I had an electric utility that made the decision to convert from coal to gas. But they also have a coal-fired plant in Stillwater, Minnesota on the St. Croix River. We also have nuclear. We have solar. We have wind. We just would like to have more funding going to R&D, so we can capture it and store it in a battery.    In Minnesota, Governor Dayton and our Legislature has decided to move forward, as have other States, knowing that coal will be part of the mix, but also making sure that we do what we can to protect our air and water.    Could you please let us know how many States are responding in a way that moves forward with emissions reduction? And are you going to have the resources available to help those States move forward that are choosing to do so?    And then I have a question regarding tribal issues.    Ms. McCollum. And in my State, my utility is working hand in hand.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you.    Last week, the subcommittee spent 2 days listening to Native American tribal leaders in public witness testimony. One thing we heard concerns about was the discrepancy on how the tribes are requesting and what they are actually receiving from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Tribes are an essential partner in restoring the health of the Great Lakes. The process of solidifying grants must be fair for all applicants, especially tribes.    I believe, and I think there are other committee members here who would agree, that is imperative that tribal nations have the resources and the staff to develop competitive grant proposals, so that they are able to manage and protect their natural resources. Speaking for many of the tribes in the Great Lakes area, they have terrific working relationships with their State partners.    Could you either tell us now or later how many grants have been awarded to tribes since 2010 when GLRI was launched? What has been the total amount of funding awarded to tribes? What kind of engagement is EPA doing with tribes to ensure that their grant proposals are competitive?    This also affects another issue, and here again I commend Governor Dayton. He proposed legislation to work with tribal nations to secure rights to hunt and gather to support their traditional diet in the Ojibwe culture. He has heard, I am sure, from tribal leaders, as I have, that they want to make sure that the habitat that they hunt and fish in is not damaged.    Can you tell me how the EPA is working to keep waterways healthy enough to support tribal treaty rights, traditional subsistence foods, and how aggressively you are making sure that tribal consultation is moving forward, especially in the area of the sulfide mining?    Ms. McCollum. Mr. Chairman, just if I could, this is going to be Administrator McCarthy's last time testifying before the committee. I think of what has happened in my lifetime on emerging issues: microbeads in personal care products, hormones, superbugs, antibiotics. These are all pollutants that have been added to our waterways.    Mr. Simpson pointed out how tight the budget is around here, but as you look back on what you have worked on, and as you look forward to some of the challenges the next EPA administrator is going to have, are there areas where regulations have not caught up with what you are facing? What are some of the emerging issues you would say that we as a committee should be prepared to grapple with as we figure out how to improve our drinking water and our water treatment systems?    Ms. McCollum. Thank you.    I would like to also join the Chairman in welcoming you here this morning, Doctor. This is going to be your first budget hearing before the Subcommittee. You were officially installed as Secretary of the Smithsonian this past October, and I am pleased to have an opportunity on the Subcommittee to learn more about your vision for the Institution and how you plan on working through some of the challenges the Chairman has pointed out.    The Smithsonian was created for an increase in the diffusion of knowledge. It has the ability to capture the imagination and the curiosity of both children and adults. It has something for everyone. In particular, the unique ImagiNATIONS children's space at the National Museum of American Indians is truly a delight for families, with the interactive crafts, Native book stories, and the exploratory learning that is there. I have to tell you, it is a destination for some young children I know well whenever they go to the Nation's Mall.    I also want to applaud you for the triumphant reopening of the Renwick, which is providing a true experience of wonder and joy for the record number of visitors, young people and adults alike. I got to be there for the opening exhibit. It was fabulous.    The Smithsonian Institution's fiscal year 2017 budget request is $922 million. It is an increase of $82 million over the 2016 enacted level. These increases will help support the Smithsonian's robust research programs, strengthen its diverse collections, and make essential investments for both the facility and the workforce.    In regards to your collection, I would note that the administration has not proposed funding for the Save America's Treasures program. That National Park Service program began in 1999, and was instrumental in partnering with others to preserve national historic collections, some of which are housed in your museums at the Smithsonian. For example, the Star-Spangled Banner flag was a recipient of Save America's Treasures.    I hope, if given an opportunity, the Smithsonian will support efforts to restore this important Park Service program, which has a direct connection to being able to preserve your collections.    Like other agencies in this subcommittee's jurisdiction, the Smithsonian is facing challenges with its facility and maintenance backlog. Many of the museums are still operating under the original major buildings systems and equipment and some are more than 50 years old.    Currently, the Smithsonian's overall facilities condition index rating from the National Research Council is considered poor. In order to achieve an acceptable facilities condition index score and ensure the health and safety for visitors, staff, and, yes, at the zoo, the animals in its care, the budget requests $163 million. This amount would continue major renovations and efforts at the National Zoo and other priority areas, including the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of Natural History.    It also provides a $50 million increase for the National Air and Space Museum, beloved by millions and one of the most visited museums in the world. Unfortunately, the museum is facing significant challenges with a deteriorating facade, which allows moisture into the building, and I am sure we will hear more about that, Mr. Chairman.    This funding is the first of several significant increases the Smithsonian will be requesting to address the issues at the Air and Space Museum. It will fund preconstruction activities at the museum and construction of offsite storage.    Although these are large investments, they are in the long-term interests of the Nation. It is also the Federal Government's responsibility to provide the necessary funding to ensure the 28 million annual visitors to the Smithsonian are welcomed each year and have a safe and enriching experience.    I am pleased that the National Museum of African American History and Culture will be opening this fall. The museum will provide a place to learn about the rich history and cultural experience and achievements of Americans of African descent. It will also be the first digital museum on the National Mall. That means anyone can share the experience. When Lonnie Bunch, the Museum's Director, was out in Minnesota, we were talking about it. People in Minnesota are so excited that they are going to be able to be there as part of the opening.    Virtual collections provide amazing educational opportunities for millions of children. You are bringing the museum right into classrooms, and I say that as a social studies teacher.    So, Doctor, I appreciate the work that you and all of the employees at the Smithsonian do to enhance the civic, educational, scientific, and artistic life of this Nation and preserve it. So I look forward to your testimony.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for the time.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you. I am sure Ms. Pingree is going to make a plug for her park, but we have some great ones in Minnesota, too.    We met in my office, and since then I have been doing more and more homework. I want to better understand where you see the Institution going in the future, especially now that we have all these surprises, should I say, for the Air and Space Museum renovation.    Last January, the Board of Regents gave the Smithsonian permission to explore creating an exhibit space in London. It is my understanding such a venture would be done completely using private funds, but you have been talking about leveraging a lot of private funds here today for current collections and current buildings.    I am concerned that Congress has not been a full part of this discussion. I bring this up because, at a minimum, the Smithsonian is an establishment of the United States and its funds are held in the U.S. Treasury. In the event of a lawsuit, it is represented by the Department of Justice. So we are intertwined here.    In 2006, the Smithsonian entered into a business venture with Showtime network that drew the ire of Congress because of a lack of consultation. Former Secretary Small later admitted that in hindsight, the Smithsonian should have consulted with the Congress. Can you tell us when we can expect to learn more about the Smithsonian's finance plan regarding London, if it is on hold, and how you plan on consulting with Congress?    As you look around and are addressing the problems, as I said earlier, at your domestic facilities like the National Zoo, can you really rely on having enough private contributions from private foundations like the Friends of the National Zoo to assist you with the deferred maintenance operation? If not, we have to come back and ask the Federal Government to address some of these problems.    Please give us an update of where you are on London and elsewhere. Then, if time permits, I have a question on the Arts and Industries Building as well.    Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Ms. McCollum. The Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building is an icon on the National Mall and is right next to the Castle. It is an important role, part of the history of the Smithsonian. At one time it was included by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of the most endangered historic sites in the United States. The building was closed in 2004 for renovations. In fact, it was just last spring, almost 10 years later, that the Smithsonian announced that it was opening the building for short-term exhibits.    Could you please update the committee on how you see the Arts and Industries Building fitting into your south campus, and the current condition of the building? When will you finally be able to host events? Is the challenge still of adequate plumbing and HVAC systems there? Then I hope that you also talk to Congress about renovating the gardens there, right adjacent to the building, because we are already starting to hear about that.    Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    And I will follow up with your staff on the questions on the gardens. Thank you.
