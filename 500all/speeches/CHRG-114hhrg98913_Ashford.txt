    Mr. Ashford. Thank you.    Doctor, thank you, and thanks for the report.    We at the University of Nebraska have engaged in--and I know you are aware of this--a number of initiatives, starting with Dr. Phil Smith a few years--well, 10 or 12 years ago--in some of his initiatives that have evolved into the Ebola facility at UNMC . And there is great hope that they can expand that facility further to provide training and other, obviously not only for Ebola, but for the whole grouping of threats here.    And again, I thought Congresswoman Stefanik's point is well taken, is that facility and that initiative at UNMC is a public-private partnership as well. And so the kind of training that would go on there, and I know your report reflects this, is not only would be training healthcare professionals, training others that are going to be engaging in these threats.    How would you see that training regimen working? And I know you have mentioned it in the report, but if you could just elaborate on it.    Mr. Ashford. There seems to be such a--your report reflects this--but such a revival in this comprehensive approach now. It is not just about reacting, obviously, but it is being very proactive, and it is a very welcome report.    I hesitate to mention to the chairman that in Nebraska--not everything happens in South Carolina, I don't want to make light of that--but, I mean, we have certain--we love South Carolina, but--thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Ashford. Right. No, I understand. But had that roadmap----    Mr. Ashford. And what is interesting about the effort, I think, not only at UNMC, but certainly Emory and other institutions around the country, is these institutions do stand ready to make the investment in plant and equipment to move forward.    So thank you very much. It is a great report.
