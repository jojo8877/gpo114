    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Gruenberg, let me ask you, your opinion and that overall of the FDIC, should banks be national? Or is there a need for local community banks?    Mr. Hice. I do, too, and yet they're closing all over the place and they're not being approved all over the place. Do you believe that there are too many banks in this country?    Mr. Hice. What about banks as a whole?    Mr. Hice. Are there too many?    Mr. Hice. Does the FDIC in any way have a strategy, a plan, a policy for consolidation in the banking sector?    Mr. Hice. And yet banks are being swallowed up by bigger banks?    Mr. Hice. Does the FDIC have any role in that either through policies, or in any way would you think FDIC is responsible or has a role in that consolidation?    Mr. Hice. Do you believe that competition in the market is important?    Mr. Hice. Should consumers have options when it comes to banks?    Mr. Hice. They're getting fewer and fewer options. We're all certainly watching that.    Let me for a quick moment, Mr. Browning, let me go to you. Your written testimony estimates that it costs nearly a million dollars for the application process. How much would this have cost, do you think, had you gone the entire way through the process?    Mr. Hice. So your experience is that the cost involved certainly affected not only you, but other interested candidates out there would struggle over the cost of the process?    Mr. Hice. No light at the end of the tunnel, as you describe.    Your written testimony also mentions that the FDIC felt like there was no community need for your bank. Do you have any idea what the definition is of a community need?    Mr. Hice. Did the FDIC explain to you what their interpretation of ``community need'' was?    Mr. Hice. Who's best to make that determination, the FDIC or those in the local community as to what the community need is for a bank?    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
