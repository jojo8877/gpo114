    Mr. Trott. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for scheduling the markup of H.R. 400. We should obviously expect and demand transparency and accountability of contractors employing foreign workers. And when we discover practices that exacerbate human trafficking, we should demand not only detailed plans to correct the violations, but also penalties should be imposed.    I also want to thank the chairman for scheduling a markup of House Resolution 53. The aggression on the part of Boko Haram has been unconscionable and has been a breach of the principles of political and religious freedom that this country is built on. The ability to freely practice religion and participate in the political system has brought us prosperity and would bring prosperity to Nigeria as well. In this spirit, we should encourage Nigeria to not submit to terrorism and fear but instead move forward with their elections.    We stand with the Nigerian Government.    They have our support, and we thank the African Union for all of their efforts to combat this problem.    I yield back my time.    Mr. Trott. I just wanted to thank the chairman and the ranking member for moving H.R. 757 forward. The chairman wisely scheduled a hearing a couple of weeks ago on North Korea. And I for one found the answers from the representative from the State Department and his complete confidence in the President's Executive order on North Korea--I think it is Executive Order 13687--his belief that that Executive order would singularly correct North Korea's bad behavior a little disturbing. And it was clear from the discussion that additional, more vigorous sanctions are required.    So, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
