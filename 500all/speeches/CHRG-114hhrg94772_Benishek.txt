    Dr. Benishek. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here this morning. I appreciate your questions, Mrs. Dingell--my colleague from Michigan, by the way.    I would like to ask you all about the working relationship that you have with the Federal Government on conservation issues. Now, we have talked about the state's efforts to do this management; and, frankly, I agree with you, because I think that the Feds just don't have the intimate knowledge of the states that local conservation people do. They know the areas that are involved, so I am on board with you.    But I want to know what level of cooperation exists at this point in time? Could maybe each of you kind of clue me into that briefly, so that I could ask another question?    Dr. Benishek. Sure.    Dr. Benishek. What do you mean by a top-down directive, then?    Dr. Benishek. Explain that to me.    Dr. Benishek. I appreciate that answer. Mr. Miller, could you give me an answer?    Dr. Benishek. Let me ask Mr. Swartout if he agrees with that assessment, that there is some top-down directive in changing the plan that doesn't seem to be effective in the management of the grouse.    Dr. Benishek. Thank you. Well, we are out of time. Thank you----    The Chairman. Thank you.    Mr. Polis.
