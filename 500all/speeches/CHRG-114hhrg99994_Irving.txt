    Mr. Irving. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, and members of the committee. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you to present the Sergeant at Arms Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2017.    Before beginning, I would like to say that it is truly an honor to have an opportunity to serve this institution, and I look forward to continuing to work with you and the other members of the committee as the year progresses. My full testimony, which I have submitted for the record, has my entire fiscal year 2017 budget.    As you know, the Office of the Sergeant at Arms provides security, safety, and protocol services to Members, committees, and the staff who serve them. To accomplish our mission, we have an extremely dedicated team whose diverse strengths provide the highest level of professionalism and expertise.    Employees of the Sergeant at Arms have supported numerous special events over the past year, including the unprecedented visit of His Holiness Pope Francis of the Holy See, the annual State of the Union address by the President, off-site retreats, visits by heads of state, honorary ceremonies, concerts, and other events throughout the year. Planning is currently under way for the inauguration of the 45th President of the United States.    As Sergeant at Arms, I receive real-time intelligence information providing an overview of campus wide, local, national, international events which may have an impact on the safety and security of the House of Representatives. The information is gleaned from a myriad of sources through a partnership with Federal, State, and local intelligence and law enforcement agencies.    However, as a point of note, despite our best intelligence assessments, prudent security protocols are always our best measure to keep Members, staff, and visitors safe. All of these resources and efforts in intelligence gathering assist me in evaluating security countermeasures in the context of new and emerging threats. And, I want to assure this committee that I carefully evaluate and balance the security protocols and security posture of the House with the effects that any new security protocol may have on the business process of the institution.    In partnership with the Capitol Police, my office maintains a strong, effective outreach program with Member offices regarding district office security. We offer guidance on best practices, providing information on how to obtain a thorough security review and how to coordinate security surveys when requested. We will continue to provide this essential service to offices, remaining mindful of the need to provide cost-effective recommendations and solutions.    Two of our most successful initiatives to date have been the implementation of mail hoods in the district offices and our Law Enforcement Coordinator program.    In closing, I would like to thank the committee once again for the opportunity to appear before you. I want to assure you of my deep commitment, and that of my entire office, to providing the highest quality services for the House of Representatives, while maintaining the safest and most secure environment possible. We remain vigilant and focused on security preparedness, striving to adhere to the strict level of fiscal accountability entrusted to us by the House of Representatives.    As always, I will keep the committee informed of my activities, and will be happy to answer any questions you may have.    Mr. Irving. Thank you.             Opening Remarks--Chief Administrative Officer    Mr. Irving. Of course, Congresswoman. The management structure as it currently exists, as you know, as House Sergeant at Arms I am very responsive to Members of the House, leadership, and my committees of jurisdiction. When there is a concern, I raise that, obviously, before the Board, if there is a House concern. The Senate Sergeant at Arms does the same. When he receives an issue from his leadership or his committees of jurisdiction or his Membership, he will raise that to the Capitol Police.    Many times the issues are in synch, we have the same issues. Sometimes not. Each Chamber has its own, as you know, set of unique circumstances. We work very closely together and with the Chief. The Chief, we consider him a full partner.    Ex officio, there is a historical aspect to that. The Capitol Police Board hires the Chief, and I believe that is one reason why, for that matter, may be ex officio.    Mr. Irving. Yes.    Mr. Irving. Yes.    Mr. Irving. It was the lockdown during the Navy Yard.    Mr. Irving. Yes.    Mr. Irving. I will say that later this month the Capitol Police Board will be meeting with the committees of jurisdiction on both sides, House and Senate, authorizers and appropriators. This is something, actually, that we have been discussing for some time to increase the transparency.    Mr. Irving. Yes. There is an invitation, I believe for the 16th of this month, but if not, forthcoming. We have discussed this issue of transparency, and we think it is important for our oversight committees on both sides to hear what the Capitol Police Board has to say, listen to how we make our decisions, talk about some of our agenda items.    Mr. Irving. I don't think so. I believe that I, as I report to your committee, to the appropriators, to the authorizing committees, to leadership, I believe that I receive clear direction and oversight, and I carry that to the Board. I also make recommendations to you, to leadership, to authorizing committees, to Members on my best view on our security posture.    But at the end of the day, it is a combination of working within the business process of the institution and those security parameters that I would recommend, and as you know, all the other factors that go into it, our fiscal resources and what have you.    There is that same dynamic on the Senate side. And we do our best to let the Chief of the Capitol Police be the Chief, and run the department. And, as we get together as a Board, talk broad policy oversight issues, strategic plan, the future of the department, and those sorts of things.    So, I think the Board's structure is small, it is nimble, with both Sergeants at Arms, the Architect, and the Chief. We can get together pretty quickly on the fly and make some pretty quick decisions. But I am always available to interact, obviously, with our committees of jurisdiction and leadership if there is anything that is concerning to you that I must bring before the Board.    Mr. Irving. OK.    Mr. Irving. OK. Let me see if I can address your concern.    Over the last number of years, I have received some degree of funding for the initiative from this committee. And, I cannot thank you enough for your support in beginning to move the process forward, because we have identified the House garages as a vulnerability, one of our big vulnerabilities.    So we did receive funding in fiscal year 2014--to begin to implement the initiative, which would start with the infrastructure. It was a combination of infrastructure money for the Architect of the Capitol to run conduit, wiring, and such to our doors so we would be able to control the doors from the garages into the House office buildings. And there was also some funding provided for security-related equipment for the doors, locking mechanisms and such.    So as we were at the point in time whereas that phase one was nearing completion, we were looking at world events. We had a particularly tough year 2015 relative to terrorist hits. We have had, based on world events, intelligence, we felt----    Mr. Irving. Elsewhere in the country, correct. We felt it was important to move forward on the initiative as quickly as possible.    Mr. Irving. I would say the Capitol Police Board. The Capitol Police Board.    The fact that we had the infrastructure in place and the Capitol Police had surplus, had equipment, magnetometers, x rays. The missing piece, frankly, was the manpower piece, the FTE piece. In working with the Chief, we realized that we could rearrange some internal posting and find some efficiencies, some short-term efficiencies, to begin to move forward with the initiative.    Mr. Irving. I will say that I take responsibility for any action that is taken, decision that is taken----    Mr. Irving. I will say that the fact that we had reached the stage in the garage security initiative that allowed us to do some initial screening, even though it is not the full screening that you alluded to, but it is incremental----    Mr. Irving. No, I felt that we could find some efficiencies to get the process underway. The garages have been a tremendous vulnerability for us. I understand that we did not have intelligence that was--any real-time intelligence. But nonetheless----    Mr. Irving. I have to tell you that I take responsibility.    Mr. Irving. It was a Board decision.    Mr. Irving. I work with staff, with leadership, with the committees of jurisdiction, both authorizers and appropriators.    Mr. Irving. I have to take responsibility for that, Congresswoman. I can't tell you----    Mr. Irving. I did not view it as outside of the regular order process considering the fact that----    Mr. Irving. No, I worked very closely with the Committee on House Administration on this project. But I would say that ultimately the decision was mine to move the process forward.    Mr. Irving. The leadership staff was also involved. But again, I was the one who----    Mr. Irving. I wouldn't say that I--the relationship is such that direction comes from leadership when we are putting a security posture in place. The implementation of a security posture is my decision. It is a give and take with the staff in terms of what our vulnerabilities are, intelligence. And ultimately, I have to take the responsibility for----    Mr. Irving. OK. First, Congressman, I appreciate very much your thoughts on the garage security issue, because, believe me, these decisions weigh heavily on me.    The vulnerability of our House garages has been something that has been in the background for a long time. We feel that proper security protocol would be to include the House garages or the House office buildings in our secure perimeter. So similar to the Senate and the Capitol, once you enter, you are in the secure perimeter, and then you, for example, would not need to get, let's say, rescreened going from the House office buildings to the Capitol.    Mr. Irving. Well, it would be incremental. That would be something, obviously, working very closely with the committee to eventually work toward.    Mr. Irving. It is such a large project getting all our House garages secure that we felt an incremental approach, little by little. To do it all at once would be----    Mr. Irving. Well, the Longworth, Cannon, the east and west underground were certainly the easiest, along with the Ford Building. The Rayburn, as you have said, is quite a bit more of a challenge.    Mr. Irving. We could do that, but we would rather get some----    Mr. Irving. It is a judgment call, but I think those of us in the security field would like to put as much security in place as possible.    Mr. Irving. We don't know that number, considering that Members don't get screened. We don't know that number.    Mr. Irving. I am sorry?    Mr. Irving. They are permitted by statute to----    Mr. Irving. There is statutory authority within the Capitol. For example, they can bring firearms to their office. I can provide you with all that information. And because of that, we don't, as you know, we don't screen Members, so we just have no----    Mr. Irving. No.    Mr. Irving. That is the statute.    Mr. Irving. I would look forward to that. I really would.    Congresswoman, I do want to address some of your points as well, because I don't want there to be a question, a veracity question in your mind. If we have more time we can chat a little further about this. I just want you to know that I do make ultimately--many Members coming to me day in and day out--I don't really make those. But I would like to engage in a little more conversation with you on this.    Mr. Irving. Yes, that is staff, but we can certainly, absolutely, do Members as well. So I will address that with my counterpart, with the Senate Sergeant at Arms.
