    Mrs. Maloney. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome to all the witnesses. Good to see you again, Mr. Dodaro, and I'd like to ask you about the Data Act which was passed in a bipartisan way by this committee, and it helps reduce duplication by making spending data comparable across all programs. This also allows the executive branch to better measure the cost to the Federal Government for these investments. When you testified last year before this committee, you said that passing the Data Act, ``One of the biggest single things that could be done in order to provide more transparency on the cost of these programs and activities.'' Do you remember saying that?    Mrs. Maloney. Can you explain why you believe this? Why you believe this so strongly, it's an important--important statement you made?    Mrs. Maloney. And then the President signed it into law in the last session. And how are we coming about in implementing it? It certainly makes good sense. If you don't have good data you can't make good decisions, and certainly we need to understand and make comparisons, but it just got passed I guess a year ago. So, when will it be completely implemented in Congress----    Mrs. Maloney. When do you expect it to be up and running so you can make these good decisions? Is it 2 years or----    Mrs. Maloney. Okay. And what are the--have you compiled the data standards yet, Ms. Cobert? Are you compiling them?    Mrs. Maloney. Well, my time is expired, but I would be very interested in seeing what your data components are, and I'd like to see if you could give them to the chairman and maybe he could share them with me. Because I really would be interested in seeing them. Congratulations. I think it's a really important project and one we should already have up and running. Thank you.    Mrs. Maloney. Thank you.
