    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Miller, whenever we are talking about payment reform, I am always concerned that we are appropriately accounting for the complexities and differences among patients. I believe that if we move forward to reform in the post-acute care setting, we should be looking to make sure that we appropriately adjust provider payments to reflect beneficiary risk. Every--and personal conditions, and it kind of follows on what Mr. Guthrie was asking about.    Could you give us a--quickly, a little greater detail, do you believe a risk adjustment is an appropriate issue to focus on and what steps do we need to take, for example, in developing a bundled payment that would appropriately account for differences in beneficiaries?    Ms. Castor. Thank you.
