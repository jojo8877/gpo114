    Ms. RADEWAGEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    My question is for Mr. Vitale. Is it safe to say that the higher cost associated with the tax compliance obligations that tax professionals endure push small business owners to waste their time preparing their own complicated taxes instead of growing their business?    Ms. RADEWAGEN. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
