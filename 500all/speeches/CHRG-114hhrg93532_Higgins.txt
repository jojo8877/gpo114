    Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, Mr. Secretary.    Just on the Iran issue. Centrifuges, uranium enrichment, breakout capability. Ten years ago, Iran had about 164 operational centrifuges, which are the machines which mix uranium at supersonic speeds to create weapons-grade material. Today there is over 19,000, and it is suggested that 9,400 of them are operational centrifuges to enrich uranium.    How important is the number of centrifuges to the negotiations ongoing right now?    Mr. Higgins. Do we accept that Iran should have thousands of operational centrifuges to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes?    Mr. Higgins. Mr. Secretary, let me ask you this. You know, we are sitting at the table with the Iranians negotiating, obviously, a very, very important issue relative to the nuclear program, relative to their nuclear intentions, not only to the region but to the world. And concurrently, we are involved in Iraq, Syria. And the Iranian influence there, despite the Americans believing that we have a friendly government in Iraq, it seems as though the loyalties of the Iraqi Government are more closely aligned with Iran and the Quds forces commander, Qasem Soleimani. The Shiite militias have been successful of late against the Islamic State, but the concern is they have a bad history with us.    You know, we authorized, you know, the President's request for military force in Iraq. And we are going to be right in the midst of fighters who are experienced but also have a contemporary history of shooting our guys, essentially. So, while we are both fighting ISIS, there must be concerns on the part of the American military about how do you influence the Shiite militias who will also be there fighting, you know, the same target?
