    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I think we have got a very great facility for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. I think the TSA frankly is not utilizing it to the full potential, certainly not to the potential that would be helpful. But how long on an average does a new hire have to wait before they begin training at the TSA Academy?    Mr. Hice. So 4 months is the average wait?    Mr. Hice. All right. How ----    Mr. Neffenger.--worth hiring.    Mr. Hice. What percentage of TSO go through FLETC?    Mr. Hice. Ten percent?    Mr. Hice. Is that local training as effective as the FLETC training?    Mr. Hice. I know the curriculum, but is it as effective ----    Mr. Hice. Okay.    Mr. Hice. How many airports have requested the authorization to utilize local training?    Mr. Hice. Two? Okay. Have any been denied?    Mr. Hice. Is there a clear policy to determine the as-need basis?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Could you submit that to us ----    Mr. Hice. Okay. So was this some sort of scheme to get him--well, could you explain smurfing?    Mr. Hice. Smurfing.    Mr. Hice. Okay. So if there is $90,000 broken up in $10,000 increments, is that the type of thing that would need approval from DHS?    Mr. Hice. All right. So why do you say that? Why is that not justifiable? What does not appear to be to you?    Mr. Hice. It looks like something is being hidden.    Mr. Hice. Mr. Roth, I would really like to hear your comments on all of this.    Mr. Hice. Okay.    Mr. Roth.--smurfing is breaking up specific financial transactions to something below the reporting requirement, which is what happened here.    Mr. Hice. Right.    Mr. Hice. So the intent is to hide?    Mr. Hice. Yes, absolutely, and that is what smurfing is, and I appreciate you bringing that.    Is there anything currently preventing the agency--back to you, Admiral--from disguising these bonuses in forms of payments, be it relocation or any other method where it is really just a disguise for bonuses?    Mr. Hice. I would like to have that ----    Mr. Hice.--policy submitted.    Mr. Hice. So your testimony here is that there is no disguise taking place?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
