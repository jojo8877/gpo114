    Mr. Grothman. I will start with Mr. Livingston. Here on the sheet they give us they call you Dr. Livingston.    Mr. Grothman. Are you aware of examples of an OI investigation that you believe was used specifically to remove anybody from the agency, any specific examples?    Mr. Grothman. And what do you do that you get yourself in trouble that they go after you?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. So in other words, the mentality is not to do the best job that they can, what TSA should be doing. The idea is to establish kind of a respect for the people at the top?    Mr. Grothman. Because you saw something happen and were going to report it?    Mr. Grothman. Just a horrible mentality. Okay. We'll give Mr. Brainard and Mr. Rhoades a question. Could one of you give a background kind of on how integrity tests are conducted at the airports?    Mr. Grothman. So in other words, just kind of for kicks they put a stupid plastic pen on the ground, and if somebody ----    Mr. Grothman. Okay. And do you think when they do these tests, do you think they ever target individual employees or individual airports or is there ----    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Just kind of a general waste of time.    Mr. Grothman. Yes.    Mr. Grothman. Yes.    Mr. Brainard.--any more than the public does.    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Thanks for the extra time.
