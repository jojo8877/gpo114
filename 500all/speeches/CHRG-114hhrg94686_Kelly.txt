    Ms. Kelly. Thank you. I would say most of us in this room recognize the importance of trade to the future of our economy. Accordingly, as we consider future trade deals, we must engage in a deeper, broader, and more inclusive dialogue about its impact on American families. This stated objective of U.S. trade policy is to liberalize markets by reducing trade and investment barriers, creating a rules-based trading system, enforcing commitments under trade agreements, and supporting economic growth.    What role do EXIM Bank, OPIC, and TDA play in supporting U.S. trade policy goals?    Ms. Kelly. Thank you.    Ms. Kelly. I yield back the remainder of my time. I have to go vote, Mr. Chairman.
