    Ms. Adams. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Ranking Member Fudge, and thank you to the panelists for your testimony.    Mr. Sargrad, what in your estimation would happen without an enforceable standard for compliance with the supplement not supplement requirement that can be used by State auditors, and what happens if it is left completely open for interpretation?    Ms. Adams. Thank you. Dr. Canavero, the proposed rule simply asks each LEA to come up with an allocation formula for State and local funds, to apply that formula, and then to prove that the Title I schools within the district receive the funding they deserve under the LEA's own allocation formula.    Can you help me understand why this is bad or an inequitable policy?    Ms. Adams. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Owens, you argued that allowing district administrators to override school level decisions to ensure there is a balance. However, superintendents are tasked with overriding school level decisions all the time in order to balance competing demands and make sure that all children are served.    So are there times when superintendent decisions should override school level decisionmaking?    Ms. Adams. Alright. Thank you very much. I yield back.
