    Mr. Johnson. I'll second the motion.    Mr. Johnson. I ask for a recorded vote, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Johnson. Aye.    Mr. Johnson. Would the gentleman yield?    Mr. Johnson. Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Mr. Johnson. Yes. I just want to ask, Representative, whether or not you have any evidence whatsoever that Planned Parenthood has broken the law in any way.    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Stoltenberg, would you mind me having a look at one of the books that you have compiled.    Mr. Johnson. No. I'll send someone down to take a look at it.    And while she's coming down to do that, let me ask Dr. Levatino a question.    Sir, is there any circumstance under which you would agree that a woman should have a right to have an abortion to abort a fetus that arose from incest or rape?    Mr. Johnson. You would support a law that would ban abortions----    Mr. Johnson. Oh, that would allow. So you believe that a woman should have a right to choose in the case of incest or rape.    Mr. Johnson. And what about you, Ms. Thayer?    Mr. Johnson. So you went to work at Planned Parenthood knowing that part of the work that Planned Parenthood does is terminating pregnancies?    Mr. Johnson. You did not know that when you went to work?    Mr. Johnson. Well, let me ask you this question.    You are a woman who was fired by Planned Parenthood, and you are a disgruntled ex-employee. Is that correct?    Mr. Johnson. Well, you were fired, correct?    Mr. Johnson. And you are now disgruntled. Is that not correct?    Mr. Johnson. So you loved Planned Parenthood?    Mr. Johnson. You believe----    Ms. Thayer.--Medicaid eligible women pay for those pills.    Mr. Johnson. Do you believe that they should be defunded?    Mr. Johnson. Well, Dr. Levatino--and thank you, Ms. Thayer. You've got a lawsuit pending, by the way, right?    Mr. Johnson. It's a whistleblower case where, if you win, you'll make a lot of money.    Mr. Johnson. Well, you'll make a lot of money if you win. Take it from me.    Mr. Johnson. Well, money doesn't matter, though, to you.    Mr. Johnson. All right. Okay.    Well, Mr. Levatino, as far as you know, Planned Parenthood doesn't make political contributions, does it?    Mr. Johnson. Or if they do make contributions, they don't do it, do they, Ms. Fredrickson?    Mr. Johnson. All right. Well, doctor, are you aware of the stories of the many women whose lives have literally been saved by Planned Parenthood?    Mr. Johnson. Well, that's not my question. My question is, are you aware of that being the case?    Mr. Johnson. Okay. How about you, Ms. Thayer?    Mr. Johnson. Okay. You don't want to answer the question then. Well, you haven't heard about the story of Tiffany, who was so broke that she couldn't afford a regular doctor's visit, so Planned Parenthood was her only option and that a routine Pap smear at Planned Parenthood diagnosed her with cervical cancer, the early discovery of which saved her life. Are you not familiar with Tiffany's case?    Mr. Johnson. I'm sure that it was gladly payable for her life to be saved.    Mr. Johnson. It could not be more than the value of her life, I can guarantee you that. I'm sure she's quite happy at the little bit that she paid, but----    Mr. Johnson. Maybe she could not have gotten transportation.    Mr. Johnson. And that's in your neighborhood, though. But there are other people with different circumstances, and shouldn't you be concerned about them?    Mr. Johnson. And the purpose of this hearing was to shut down Planned Parenthood because of abortion.
