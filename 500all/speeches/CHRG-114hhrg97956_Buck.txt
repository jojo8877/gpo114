    Mr. Buck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Good afternoon, Mr. Rodriguez.    Mr. Buck. I wanted to ask you, how did Ms. Malik get into the country? How did she slip through the procedures that you have?    Mr. Buck. Okay.    Mr. Buck. You are a former prosecutor.    Mr. Buck. And I was a former prosecutor also. I didn't specialize in prosecuting dead people. I'm wondering why you can't talk about someone's application after they have been killed or after they've died.    Mr. Buck. Well, there are a lot of law enforcement investigations going on right now throughout the country. But how does information on her application that you would have examined or that your agency would have examined implicate a Federal investigation?    Mr. Buck. Okay.    What have you learned from the fact that your agency allowed someone into this country who ended up participating in a mass killing? What changes has your agency made to its procedures?    Mr. Buck. Well, what authority would you like to have?    Mr. Buck. Can we have it today in 2 minutes and 1 second?    Mr. Buck. Could you do anything in terms of developing a profile on this particular individual that would help you in your determination of whether other individuals should come into the country?    Mr. Buck. Sure. Did you do anything--we all understand what happened in San Bernardino, and you know who did it. And you had information on this individual that you can't share with us. Did you look at that information and make any changes to your background checks and what information you need and what information you'd like before admitting somebody into this country?    Mr. Buck. What are you weighing?    Mr. Buck. Okay.    Mr. Chairman, based on my inability to get any specific information that's helpful, I will yield back.
