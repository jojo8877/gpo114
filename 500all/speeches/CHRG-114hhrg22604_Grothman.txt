    Mr. Grothman. I will give you a general question. And we actually had a panel on a similar topic on Joint Economic recently.    Part of our problem is that income growth is not as rapid as it should be. And I would like you guys to comment on the degree to which that is caused by us currently discouraging work. I got home a couple weekends ago, ran into a CPA, telling me about all the people who were intentionally working less to get their ObamaCare subsidy. And, clearly, the ObamaCare subsidy was designed to encourage people not to work very hard.    The same is true about the wide variety of what you call welfare programs, earned income credit, clearly designed to discourage people from working hard, food share, low income, everything.    I would like you guys to comment on that and the degree to which the slow growth of our economy and, as a result, lower growth in revenues than anticipated, is caused by this seeming policy of the Federal Government today to discourage work.    Mr. Grothman. Well, go ahead. I am sorry.    Mr. Grothman. I will have to respond and ask Dr. Bernstein here. Do you ever talk to any accountants out in the real world to tell you, or maybe people in the income maintenance area, or employers who deal with people in the $10 to $15 an hour range? I mean, if you just talk to a few people in that area, you will again and again and again find employers or accountants who will tell you stories in which people are not taking a second job or turning down overtime or turning down wages because it will affect all their benefits. You can do a study, and who knows whether the study is done accurately or not. All you have to do is talk to people and the stories just come like a waterfall out of them.
