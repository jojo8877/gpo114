    Mr. McNerney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, I do appreciate the big effort that went into producing this QER document. Nice work. The document does recommend legislation actions. Would you elaborate on 1 or 2 of the most urgent actions that would be required?    Mr. McNerney. Very good. One of the things that is discussed is the potential for energy storage and grid modernization, grid resilience. Do you think that there is a short-term potential for that energy storage to be useful in grid resilience and in lowering the cost and improving access for renewables and so on?    Mr. McNerney. Right.    Mr. McNerney. Are we pretty close to having the technology available?    Mr. McNerney. Well, thank you. Do you feel that the regional grid reliability would be put at risk by the Clean Power Plan?    Mr. McNerney. What would be the best way to deal with the regional question then that you just referred to of grid reliability?    Mr. McNerney. Well, there seems to be a patchwork of transmissions citing initiatives across federal agencies. The QER highlights a need to improve coordination between all the stakeholders for transmission-permitting processes. Do you believe that the Rapid Response Transmission Team has been effective, and should its role be expanded?    Mr. McNerney. OK, thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
