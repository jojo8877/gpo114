    Mrs. Hartzler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here, and please walk us through the number of mariners that would be available during times of war, and how that number is calculated.    Mrs. Hartzler. Do you think that is the adequate to meet the defense strategy, or potential threats out there, or that we need more? How comfortable and confident do you feel that that is----    Mrs. Hartzler. Are you trying to recruit, and to increase that number? How are you trying to address what you think might be a shortfall?    Mrs. Hartzler. Very good. Who picks the ships for the Maritime Security Program, and how are they selected?    Mrs. Hartzler. Okay. One other quick question. We hear that, to be in the Maritime Security Program, a ship must be American owned. So how, then, does Maersk, a Danish owned company, have 20 ships in MSP?    Mrs. Hartzler. Thank you. I yield back.
