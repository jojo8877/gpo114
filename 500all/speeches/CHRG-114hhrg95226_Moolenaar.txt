    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Kerr, I'd just like to continue following up with you and then also talk to Mr. Kovacs and Mr. Eisenberg on some of the Waters of the United States issues. What in your judgment--there were some court cases. There's the Clean Air Act and there was an effort by the EPA to clarify its jurisdiction. Is that really how we've gotten to this point?    Mr. Moolenaar. And so in your judgment, were they trying to solve a policy problem that existed out there where people throughout the country were saying, you know, there's not enough water or--what problem other than the legal issues were they trying to solve?    Mr. Moolenaar. And in your judgment, it's gotten actually more complicated. Some of these new definitions, rather than giving clarity, have really expanded their jurisdiction and raised a number of new questions.    Mr. Moolenaar. So in your judgment, and I wanted to hear from Mr. Kovacs and Mr. Eisenberg, do you view this as a significant expansion of their jurisdiction, of their authority? I mean, is that your conclusion?    Mr. Moolenaar. Mr. Kovacs, do you view this as a significant expansion of their jurisdiction or authority?    Mr. Moolenaar. Let me go to Mr. Eisenberg.    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
