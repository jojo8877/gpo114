    Mr. Posey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing, and I want to thank all the witnesses for their participation on this exciting subject.    For Dr. Reitze and Dr. Shoemaker, because the expansion of the universe is accelerating, I'm told that the science theorized a mysterious dark force is pulling us apart and that only five percent of the universe is visible to us. They say dark matter is 27 percent and dark energy is 68 percent of the universe. That's just what I read. Can the gravitational waves help us understand the missing dark matter and the dark energy better?    Mr. Posey. You know, if it took 100 years to go from Einstein's equations to discovering they're actually correct, just wildly thinking, what do you foresee in the next 100 years? And all of you just comment on that if you don't mind.    Mr. Posey. We love wild speculation in this Committee, and that's just what Einstein was 100 years ago actually.    Mr. Posey. And finally, Dr. Crim, I was wondering as the field of gravitational-wave astronomy moves forward, how are the NSF and NASA corroborating on supporting the field?    Mr. Posey. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
