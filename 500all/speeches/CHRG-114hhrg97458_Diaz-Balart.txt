    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Mr. Chairman, I apologize for being late. I was chairing my subcommittee.    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Thank you, sir.                 Chairman Frelinghuysen Closing Remarks    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, General. A couple points and then a question. And by the way, in an effort of great bipartisanship, I just want you to know that I would attend both the cigar and the ice cream summit. Just saying.    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Absolutely, sir. I am here to serve.    Actually, first I want to associate myself with the comments of Mr. Womack. I too, as I am learning more, I get more and more concerned about the issue that he brought up. I am not going to rehash it, but I just think that is an issue that we have to spend a little bit more time on.    And to both gentlemen, look, I agree with you on the sequester issue, and it is the law, unfortunately. And I am hoping, because it requires House, Senate, and President, to have in essence a deal, and I am hoping that quietly the President and the Speaker and the majority leader and others would be talking. I am hoping that will happen. But that is above our pay grade.    Let me talk a little bit about energy. I don't know in the Army, I know in other parts that, for example, fuel costs are a huge deal, and I also know that in some areas and in some other branches that we are spending bucket loads of money, of additional money, for example, on green fuels.    How much are we spending for just energy, lights and fuel for the Army? And how much are we spending, if any, on green fuels? I mean, it has got to be substantial how much we spend just on energy.    Mr. Diaz-Balart. If I may, Mr. Secretary.    Mr. Diaz-Balart. We are now the largest producer of natural gas and we are a huge producer of petroleum. And so the question is, is that a policy that we should look at? Because, yeah, if we were buying it from other sources, it makes sense to reduce your dependence on whatever it is, but if you are the number one producer or could be the number one producer, it seems that we should be using more of our domestic energy.    Look, I know it is beautiful and it is great, we all want to protect the environment, absolutely, but we are at crunch time here. And so I would like to see, and I don't want to put you on the spot, but I would like to see how much we are spending, real dollars, on renewables, how much we are spending, real dollars, on nonpetroleum-based costs. Because it would seem to me that if there is anyone who is going to benefit from more domestic production, it would be the Army, which by the way, when it is the Army, it is the country.    But anyway, I would like to again look at, have some of those details to figure out how much we are spending. And I understand there may be a federal mandate, but is it wise to be reducing what we are actually producing? The usage of what we are actually producing, it seems that it might be kind of, frankly, counterintuitive.    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Yeah. Absolutely.    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Thank you, sir. And it is always good to see you.    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I actually, as you just stated, I have to step out. I have been called out for the budget conference.    Mr. Diaz-Balart. Thank you. No, I will step out. I just want to thank you all for your service.    And thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize that I have to run out.
