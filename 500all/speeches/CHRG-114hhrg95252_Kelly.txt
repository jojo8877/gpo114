    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Ranking Member Cummings, for holding a hearing on a pressing issue like our aviation security. I would also like to thank our witnesses who have taken time out of their busy schedules to speak with us today.    Mr. Chairman, with the summer travel season fast approaching, our Nation's airports will be pressed to the maximum capacity. This means long security lines, overworked TSA agents and control tower officials. It also means detecting and neutralizing a security threat in a crowded airport can be as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack. This is something all Americans, and of course my constituents in particular, know all too well. The greater Chicago area is currently served by two airports. I'm sure most people in this room here today at some point or another have missed a connecting flight or had a long layover in one of our airports. I hear complaints from my colleagues all the time. A culture of delays, overcrowded hallways and long security lines are not only frustrating and inefficient, but also unsafe. A need for a third airport in Chicago has been known for years.    I have been working with Secretary Foxx and Administrator Huerta to make a south suburban airport a reality. I am pleased to say that the project is close to becoming a reality and I will continue to push for its creation. Therefore, I'd like to ask the witnesses to provide their insights into this matter.    How does the fact that major airports are operating at capacity impact our national security? I'll ask both my questions. Impact our national security. And the other, would construction of new airports improve our national security by easing pressures on current airports? And whoever wants to take the question.    Ms. Kelly. Thank you for your response, I appreciate it. I yield back.
