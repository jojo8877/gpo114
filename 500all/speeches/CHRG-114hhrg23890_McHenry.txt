    Mr. McHenry. Thank you, Chairman Garrett, and thank you for having this hearing, Mr. Chairman.    And I thank you all for your testimony.    I will begin by asking Mr. Keating a question. You say that angel investment is a critical source for startup and early-stage business capital, but you also note that angel investment is still sluggish. What are the dynamics at play?    Mr. McHenry. So as an economist, you can perhaps state this more succinctly than I, but if you are capped at 99 investors you have to have 99 much larger investors than perhaps 150 smaller investors. And there is a cost associated with that, is there not?    Mr. McHenry. Mr. Laws, for that point, in your experience, this 99-investor cap, coordinating investment pools in conjunction with that--I had this example presented to me yesterday that one group decided they would only have 84 investors because the length of the hold they believed that there would be deaths and divorces, and as such, that number would rise and they didn't want to imperil the longer-term hold of it.    Are there examples like that, that you could mention to us today?    Mr. McHenry. Shifting to the Fixing Crowdfunding Act, we have--there has been discussion about the problems with Title III as enacted and the problems with the over 500 pages of regs that the SEC has written. And so, Mr. Laws, in your opinion, if Congress doesn't amend Title III of the JOBS Act, will its intent actually be useful?    Mr. McHenry. So at the current pace you see this as a potential marketplace for major problems.    Mr. McHenry. What is the most important thing or two that you would point out, in terms of our action here in Congress?
