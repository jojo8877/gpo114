    Ms. Adams. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    And thank you all for your testimony.    Ms. House, during your testimony on the Certainty in Enforcement Act you mentioned that 70 million Americans would automatically be excluded from the employment sector because of criminal background searches, with the greatest impact being felt in the African-American community. According to the Crime and Delinquency Journal, by age 23, 49 percent of black males and 44 percent of Hispanic males have been arrested.    Can you speak to the effect that this legislation would have on already high employment rate for African-Americans and Hispanics and how it in turn would affect their respective communities?    Ms. Adams. Okay. So what, then, would be the impact on the already high employment rate for African-Americans and Hispanic----    Ms. Adams. Okay. Can you touch for a moment on the overcriminalization of people of color in the U.S. and how this bill would exacerbate that?    Ms. Adams. Okay. People of color more often than not have poor credit because of past forms of discrimination and limit education or employment, borrowing, and housing opportunities. This is especially alarming in the African-American community, where only 25 percent of households have a credit score of about 700.    So how can the use of someone's credit score--credit history perpetuate extended unemployment and poverty?    Ms. Adams. Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
