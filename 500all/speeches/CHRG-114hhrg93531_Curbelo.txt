    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I certainly share your concerns with regards to the administration's fiscal year 2016 budget.    Admiral Zukunft, welcome, and thank you very much for your testimony. I was in Coast Guard Station Key West on Wednesday of last week, and I was reminded of the importance and the unique challenges that the Coast Guard faces in the State of Florida.    I specifically wanted to ask you with regards to Reserve training, the President requested a $9.4 million decrease for the Reserve training account in fiscal year 2016. The budget also assumes enactment of a proposal made in the fiscal year 2015 request that would move 600 reservists from selected Reserve to inactive Ready Reserve, essentially making them unable to respond if the country needed them without significant lag time to train.    As you know, in Florida we had--and all along the gulf coast--the unfortunate incident of the Deepwater Horizon some 5 years ago. Considering the risk of terrorist attacks, of spills of national significance, do you think that these reduced numbers will allow the Coast Guard to effectively respond to these types of scenarios?    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you for your answer. I have an additional question.    In my discussion with Captain Young and Commander Reed on Wednesday down in Key West, they expressed some concerns with regards to, obviously, a potential shutdown of the department, but also of these short-term funding mechanisms for the department. Can you briefly expound on the challenges that these short-term funding measures pose to your department?    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you, Admiral. And I will yield back. But before, I want to recognize the rest of the panel. Thank you all for being here, especially Chairman Cordero, who it is a pleasure to see.    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
