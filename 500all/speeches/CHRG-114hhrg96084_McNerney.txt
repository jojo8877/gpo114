    Mr. McNerney. I enjoy being the first one with 3 minutes, Mr. Chairman. No, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their work on this and the panelists. They have very good testimony. We have the Labor Statistics' unemployment rate for African Americans at 10 percent, more than twice that for whites. Hispanics, almost as bad, some of the statistics that Ms. Martinez raised. And then on the other hand, we have all these opportunities in the energy industry. Solar industry grew 86 percent since 2010. Wind industry, 73,000 full-time workers. Energy efficiency, 1.3 to 1.9 million new jobs by 2050. So we have it and we have opportunity. What are we going to do about it? Well, we have some ideas up here on the panel. I thank you very much for that.    Dr. Brundage, I am very excited by Shale NET. I haven't heard anything about it before. I am going to ask my staff to get a copy of a description of that, see how applicable that would be. Could you give me some idea how Shale NET is funded?    Mr. McNerney. OK. Thank you. Mr. Jarvis, you said the government should promote apprenticeships. Do you have any ideas on how that should be done?    Mr. McNerney. Well, I have been to the YouthBuild program in my district, and IBW is there promoting apprenticeships. So that is good. I would like to ask Mr. Wilson a question, but I have run out of time. So I will yield back.
