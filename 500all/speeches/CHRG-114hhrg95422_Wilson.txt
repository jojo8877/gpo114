    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you all for being here today on this extraordinarily important situation that is developing. And amazingly enough, I share the concerns expressed by the editorial of The Washington Post. To quote the Washington Post, and I quote, I want to quote it correctly:        ``If it is reached in the coming days, a nuclear deal         with Iran will be, at best, an unsatisfying and risky         compromise. Iran's emergence as a threshold nuclear         power with the ability to produce a weapon quickly will         not be prevented. It will be postponed by 10 to 15         years. In exchange, Tehran will reap hundreds of         billions of dollars in sanctions relief it can use to         revive its economy and fund the wars it is waging         around the Middle East.''    And, Dr. Makovsky, I sadly agree so much. This is worse than Munich. There might have been, as you were indicating, an explanation for Neville Chamberlain's actions. But I am just very concerned. The President's actions, the weakness that is being exhibited, is just bizarre. And for a President who has been fixated, properly, on not having nuclear proliferation throughout the Middle East, it is creating a legacy of proliferation.    With that in mind, what are the consequences for regional stability if the administration does cave in to Iranian demands?    Mr. Wilson. You were showing a differentiation.    Mr. Wilson. And I appreciate you raising the concern.    And, Dr. Doran, Mr. Rademaker, in a prior hearing, a former U.N. weapons inspector discussed the strategy that Saddam Hussein used to evade inspectors, both on the ground in Iraq and at the U.N., noting that ``The inspectors reported they could do little of their job under the conditions Iraq permitted them to operate.''    Do you fear a similar outcome with Iran? Given the Iraq experience, what roadblocks do you anticipate inspectors would face, both on the ground and at the U.N.?    Mr. Wilson. Thank you all. And, again, our concern too for the people of the Iran. And so I am just hoping that, indeed, the President will change course. Thank you.    Mr. Wilson . Thank you, Mr. Sherman.    We now proceed to Congressman Ted Poe of Texas.    Mr. Wilson. Here, here. Thank you, Judge Poe. We appreciate your insight particularly on behalf of the people of Iran too.    And we now proceed to Congresswoman Lois Frankel.    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Ms. Frankel.    We now proceed to Congressman Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Perry.    We now proceed to Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida.    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Yoho.    We now proceed to Congressman David Trott of Michigan.    Mr. Wilson. Mr. Trott, thank you very much for your fresh freshman approach.    And I want to thank each of the witnesses for being here today. I am really grateful that Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking Member Eliot Engel were able to put this together. We can certainly see extraordinary concern about policies of moral relativism and concern about what we are facing.    At this time, we shall be adjourned.
