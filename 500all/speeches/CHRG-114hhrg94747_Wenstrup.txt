    Dr. Wenstrup. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    We have talked a lot about the region today, and I want to focus a little bit on our allies in the region. And maybe touch on a little bit, if you would, about their efforts of increasing their capabilities, not only in traditional warfare aspects, but, say, cyber and space and how we are coordinating with them, if you would.    General Scaparrotti. Sir, if you would, I will go first with the Republic of Korea. First, overall within their defense budget over the past 4 years or so they have been averaging about 4 to 5 percent increase in their defense budget. This past year it was 2.5 percent of their GDP , which is very good compared to, say, our NATO allies, et cetera.    And so they have been focused on meeting the capabilities that they need, given the evolving threat in North Korea, but also in order to meet the commitments that we made together as an alliance. An example being the funding of the PAC-3 upgrade and the missiles for those, this year Global Hawk, last year to assist in ISR, an improvement in their C4 systems, command control communications, computers, to enable them as we go to OPCON transition, to ensure that they can lead a combined force in a high-intensity conflict.    So overall I think they are focused on that. Within their budget they have the same challenges that we do in terms of the social demand and the competition with defense and the expense of the systems that they have to put in place in order to increase their military's capability and to deal with the threat that is evolving in the north.    Dr. Wenstrup. And what about Japan?    Dr. Wenstrup. Admiral.    Dr. Wenstrup. Thank you very much.    I yield back.
