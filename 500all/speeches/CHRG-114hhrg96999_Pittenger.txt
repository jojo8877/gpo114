    Mr. Pittenger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Overall, do you believe that the SIFI designation has been a help or a hindrance? Has it impaired competitive markets? Has it given it an advantage?    And, also, I would like to know what recommendations you would provide for statutory reform of SIFI at this time.    Mr. Simmons, we will start with you.    Mr. Pittenger. Thank you.    Dr. Barth?    Mr. Pittenger. Thank you.    Mr. Kupiec?    Mr. Pittenger. Quickly, because I am running out of time, on statutory reform, do you have any ideas?    Mr. Pittenger. All right.    Mr. Kini?    Mr. Pittenger. Thank you all very much.    I yield back my time.
