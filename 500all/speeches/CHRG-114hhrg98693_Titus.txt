    Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Halliday, thank you. My understanding about the report is that it is limited to SES employees but it includes a few GS employees who, 15 who were moving up. And this is damning enough. But I am concerned that this practice of moving people into jobs with less responsibility but the same amount of money is occurring at other levels as well. And I will just give you an example.    Ed Russell, who was previously the Director of the Reno Regional Office for VBA, which was one of the worst in the country, was put on paid leave. He stayed on that administrative leave for almost a year. Then they could not, or would not, get rid of him, so a brand new position was created in Washington. They called him a senior advisor in the Office of Field Operations, but he teleworked from Reno. He did not even move back to Washington. Now I cannot find out for sure what his salary was, but I doubt if it went down. Now the responsibility that he had as senior advisor while teleworking from Reno had to have been less than being the Director of the Regional Office. So I am concerned that as VA pushes this initiative called My VA if it is full of just patronage and cronyism, that is totally contrary to the image that it is trying to create and its efforts to restore faith in VA. And I wonder if you have any sense that this is more widespread than just the Reno office? Or if you would be willing to look into it if that would be appropriate or even possible?    Ms. Titus. And would that, it would be something that you could do, though, right?    Ms. Titus. If we requested it? Thank you very much. I yield back.    The Chairman. Ms. Walorski, you are recognized for five minutes.
