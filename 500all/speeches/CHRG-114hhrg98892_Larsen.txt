    Mr. Larsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I am going to start with a rhetorical question--it is one of those to make a point. And this is not a criticism of the contractors or of the Navy or of DOD generally. But Next-Gen Jammer is finally--we are moving forward on that. But that thing has been Next-Gen so long, I am wondering if it should be called Now-Gen or Previous-Gen Jammer. And the point is this isn't even a large submarine or aircraft carrier. This is a smaller pod to put on a platform. And it still took and is still taking a long time to get to the point where we can deploy it. But we are getting there. And it is great. So I want to be clear about that. But the point I want to make is that, big or small, it seems that the acquisition process takes a long time. And so for you, Ms. Fox, looking at MDAPs , is the MDAP problem a platform problem? Is it a program problem? Are there certain things in MDAPs that drive budget and timelines over set budgets and timelines? Are there things in MDAPs that actually get done on time and on budget?    Mr. Larsen. It seems to me that the problem is part of what makes MDAP sustainable is us. It may not be affordable, but we sustain it. That is, we end up rewarding it being over budget and not meeting the schedule by keeping it going because we need it. So there is no incentive on the front end to get it as right as we need it if we continue it despite what happens later.    Mr. Larsen. That gets to my question about whether or not you can build affordability as a goal. That is more than rhetorical.    Mr. Larsen. All right. I think I heard you use Nunn-McCurdy as a verb. So I guess we have advanced a long way if it is now a verb.    The Chairman. Mr. Wilson.
