    Ms.  Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Welcome, witnesses.    In today's complex threat environment, effective counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts rely on sophisticated intelligence-gathering and sharing capabilities. Especially because of their exponential effects, we should focus our efforts to strengthen the border on these intelligence capabilities.    Mr. Vitiello, your written testimony states, and I quote, ``A whole-of-government approach that leverages interagency and international partnerships as a force multiplier has been and will continue to be the most effective way to keep our borders secure.''    Which other agencies does Customs and Border Patrol share intelligence or information with to secure the border?    Ms.  Kelly. Can you further explain how these partnerships act as a force multiplier?    Ms.  Kelly. That is a good example of how interagency and international partnerships can strengthen the border. Any other examples?    Ms.  Kelly. It seems as though, when you hear about threats to the border, it is always the southern border, not as much the northern border. What are the percentages? Or is that how you would describe it?    Ms.  Kelly. Okay. Your testimony continues, ``DHS works with our Federal, State, local, tribal, and international partners, particularly Canada and Mexico, to address transnational threats.''    What types of helpful information does Canada and Mexico provide that the U.S. would not otherwise have access to?    Ms.  Kelly. Do you feel these partnerships have improved over time, and you are getting more and more information, and there is more of a comfort level with these other agencies?    Ms.  Kelly. Thank you so much.    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
