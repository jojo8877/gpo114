    Mr. McGovern. Thank you. I appreciate it.    And I really don't have any questions either, other than to say thank you to the panel. I think it is really important that you are here and talking about the incredible research that you are all doing; because, for a lot of Members of Congress, especially those who are not on this Committee, they don't quite make the connection between our agricultural colleges and universities and what they contribute in terms of agriculture, but in terms of business and in terms of the economy. So I appreciate you being here.    I have seen firsthand how important our land-grant universities are and the incredible work they are doing. I am proud to represent the flagship campus of the five-campus University of Massachusetts system, the UMass Amherst, in Amherst, Massachusetts. And over the years, UMass has expanded into a major research university that covers many areas of research and education, including cutting-edge research and advanced materials and manufacturing, applied life sciences and health data science, and security and many other important fields, driving economic growth in Massachusetts and across the country. But through all that transformation, the school has never forgotten its proud history and roots as an agricultural institution. And I have seen firsthand some of the most innovative and exciting projects revolve around agriculture. Some of you pointed out that some of what you do is unique to the states and areas that you live in. In Massachusetts I have seen this incredible cutting-edge research on cranberries out of UMass. But what is equally exciting to me is the work that they are doing to help, not only protect our food here in the United States, but help find ways to feed the hungry around the world, and to deal with plant diseases and animal diseases, and all the kinds of stuff that oftentimes result in catastrophes.    So I am just here to say thank you. I support our investment in all of you, and it is important that we brag about it a little bit more because I am not always sure that people get it. When you think of agriculture, oftentimes people don't automatically think about colleges and universities; they think of people working on a farm. But, like I said, I have seen firsthand in my own state, and you have all talked about it here today, unbelievable research. It is worth every penny. And it is cost-effective and you have saved lives in the process too. So anyway, I just wanted to say thank you.    I yield back.    The Chairman. Thank you. And I echo the comments from my colleague, Mr. McGovern. And thank you for those comments too.    Mr. Moolenaar, is recognized for 5 minutes.
