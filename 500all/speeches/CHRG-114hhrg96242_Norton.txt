    Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Actually, I can see something beneficial that came out of this tragic accident. And, of course, you have taken responsibility. I congratulate you on the rapid cleanup. It should not have happened in the first place, but the benefit that has come is that it has focused us on mine leaking. I would ask the Chairman to put into the record an editorial from The Salt Lake Tribune entitled, ``Editorial: Chaffetz, Bishop owe us real answers on EPA failure, not another Benghazi.'' So, your taking responsibility is very important. Perhaps it is a model for what ought to happen here.    I understand that, while there is no Federal Government data, there may be as many as 500,000 abandoned mines. Are they orphans out there, nobody takes responsibility for them? The state? The Federal Government? Nobody? Is that the case?    Ms. Norton. This was in Colorado. I note that in Colorado there are three mines listed on something called the National Priorities List.    Ms. Norton. Does this mean that those mines pose a risk, as we speak, for leakage?    Ms. Norton. Yes, and I do not understand why this is not covered by the Superfund.    Ms. Norton. Ms. McCarthy, I need to know whether this acid mine pollution with this half million or so mines poses any danger to drinking water or to fish and other wildlife.    Ms. Norton. Including drinking water?    Ms. Norton.  We could have some of this leakage into the drinking water of the American people?    Ms. Norton. But we do not have any way of knowing that until it is there?    Ms. Norton. After you monitor, can you make----    Ms. Norton. Can you then alert or make somebody do something about it?    Ms. Norton. Who does something about it?    Ms. Norton. Or EPA?    Ms. Norton. What do you do to get on that list?    Ms. Norton. Well, I see the ball is in our court on that. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Thank you. We will now turn to Mr. Meadows.
