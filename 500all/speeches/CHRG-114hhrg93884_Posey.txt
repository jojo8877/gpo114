    Mr. Posey. Thank you, Madam Chairman.    I understand the purpose of retargeting. When I look at a barbecue or a bathroom vanity or a power tool on a hardware store website, I understand, but it doesn't necessarily make me comfortable that the same product pops up on the next website that I visit. And, you know, I understand the idea that companies want to be able to target me in a similar way, but I don't understand why HealthCare.gov would feel the need to have such similar tactics incorporated as to hardware store or Zappos or whatever. I mean it seems like a larger invasion of privacy. It seems like a larger invasion of privacy to me. Just wondering what your thoughts are, both of you?    Mr. Posey. Thank you. And good answers.    Is there a requirement or standard or practice for private companies to inform visitors about third-party analytics?    Mr. Posey. Mr. Wright?    Mr. Posey. Very good.    Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back.    Chairwoman Comstock. Thank you.    I now recognize Ms. Bonamici for five minutes.
