    Mr. Engel. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Walke, I have a series of questions I would like to ask you. One of them was touched on when you had an exchange with Mr. Doyle so I would like to ask you to emphasize certain things. We have heard testimony today that all waste coal plants can meet the mercury standard under MATS but many cannot meet the hydrogen standard or the sulfur dioxide standards.    Firstly, do you agree with that assessment and in your answer if possible could you discuss the D.C. circuit court's decision in White Stallion Energy Center versus EPA?    Mr. Engel. Thank you.    Janet McCabe, the acting assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation of the EPA, submitted a written statement for today's hearing.    She says that the bill we are discussing today would remove the economic incentives to reduce emissions at waste coal plants because emissions allocations for those plants could not be traded under the cross-state air pollution rule, or CSAPR.    She argues that the result would be less efficient and more costly compliance with CSAPR. Do you agree with her assessment?    Mr. Engel. You mentioned that Section 2(b) of this bill would interfere with a state's rights to determine how to best comply with the requirements of EPA's cross-state air pollution rule and favors waste coal burning plants over other in-state power plants.    So this bill takes long-standing state authority, transfers it to the federal government and then uses that authority to pick winners and losers. Is that right and can you explain?    Mr. Engel. All right. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Walke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Engel. OK.    Mr. Engel. I was going to ask, Mr. Chairman, if perhaps Mr. Walke could respond to something that Mr. Brisini----
