    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    I want to follow up--I think you have probably touched on some of these answers already, but I really want to kind of deal with my own concerns. Like Congressman Higgins and Cook and others, I am troubled about the reports of Pakistan's development of what I consider destabilizing tactical nuclear weapons at a faster rate than most other countries, if not than any other country. I really want to understand, again, a little bit more clearly your assessment of Pakistan's progress in cooperating with the international community on nuclear proliferation concerns. And also the second part of that question has to do with some recent media reports suggesting that our administration is considering some kind of nuclear arrangement with Pakistan. I don't know. I am not really clear; what is a nuclear arrangement? And if we are considering it, is Pakistan really a trustworthy partner, again, in that? Again, like other members, the nuclear proliferation treaty concerns are very troubling.    Mr. Lowenthal. Has Pakistan increased the rate of development, the production of tactical nuclear weapons?    Mr. Lowenthal. In any way. Are we setting any preconditions or any conditions--this goes back to--about or talking to Pakistan about the reduction of its nuclear weapons?    Mr. Lowenthal. And I gather over, since, for the last 60 years, we have provided over $75 billion in assistance, primarily in military and economic assistance. Going back to the question asked by the chair, is any of our assistance that you know tied to changes in Pakistan's behavior?    Mr. Lowenthal. What does that mean, ``the results have been satisfactory''?    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you.    And I yield back.
