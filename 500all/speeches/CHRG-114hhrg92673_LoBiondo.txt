    Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I would like to thank the chairman for elevating this issue to the full committee level because of its critical importance. And Mr. Conner, Mr. Hilkemann, thank you for being here. This certification process is critically important on our country's aviation sector, and I know you have touched on this, but for the new members, could you each elaborate on the impact of the FAA's certification process that that has on your company's ability to compete and to innovate, Mr. Conner?    Mr. LoBiondo. Yes. Mr. Hilkemann.    Mr. LoBiondo. Mr. Conner, do you feel that in any way, the FAA's certification process is hampering you with global competition that is under--dealing with some different standards than you may be?    Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
