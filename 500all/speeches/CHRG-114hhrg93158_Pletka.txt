    Ms. Pletka. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. It is a pleasure to be back.    Ms. Pletka. It is harder, with the high heels and the dress, sliding your way in. Okay.    Can you hear me now?    You know, I have to say just as an aside, I am always struck by people who want to come and protest about Israel, and yet when I drive by the Syrian Embassy every day, a government that has been responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of people, nobody seems to be standing outside. It is kind of a shame.    Thank you, again, for inviting me to speak today. I am not a lawyer. So I am not going to speak to the legal issues. I do think that it is important, however, to underscore the points that everybody has addressed here today, which are U.S. laws relative to the steps that the Palestinian Authority has taken in recent months.    P.L. 113, which passed last year, 113-76, codifies restrictions on aid to the Palestinians, and the letter of the law is quite specific. It says, Limitations, none of the funds appropriated under the heading ``economic support funds'' in this act may be available for assistance to the Palestinian Authority if, after the date of enactment, the Palestinians obtain the same standing as member states or full membership as a state in the U.N. or any specialized agency thereof outside an agreement negotiated between Israel the Palestinians.    I think that has happened. The Palestinians initiate an International Criminal Court judicially authorized investigation or actively support such an investigation that subjects Israeli nationals to an investigation for alleged crimes against Palestinians.    I think it is important to look at the letter of the law as the State Department ``decides'' whether in fact the law has been violated. There is not much room for decision-making here it seems to me.    The very conditions you have laid out on the question of standing within the U.N. and member agencies, as well as claims before the ICC, have in fact, been violated. And, legally, aid to the Palestinians should be cut off.    The U.S. provides about $400 million a year, a little less in the current request, in annual economic support funds and other funds to the West Bank and Gaza. Cutting off that aid will inevitably harm some Palestinians.    But those who desire self-governance and self-determination for the Palestinian people also have to accept the notion that the Palestinian people need to live with the choices that have been made by their leaders.    There are few who believe that the ICC case or Palestinian efforts within the U.N. will bring about the creation of a Palestine state.    But don't listen to me. Let me now quote Ambassador Dennis Ross, Dave's colleague, who spoke to this very issue:          ``Since 2000<greek-l>,'' Dennis wrote, deg.         <greek-l>`` deg.there have been three serious         negotiations that culminated in offers to resolve the         Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In each case, a proposal         on all the core issues was made to Palestinian leaders,         and the answer was either no or no response.         Palestinian political culture is rooted in a narrative         of injustice. Compromise is portrayed as betrayal, and         negotiations, which are by definition about mutual         concessions, will inevitably force any Palestinian         leader to challenge his people by making a politically         costly decision. But going to the United Nations does         no such thing. It puts pressure on Israel and requires         nothing of the Palestinians.''    In short, the U.N. and the ICC aren't about solving problems. They are about an unwillingness to negotiate and compromise for a true and lasting peace.    But going to the ICC is qualitatively different than going to the U.N.--and you didn't touch on this, but I think it is really an important distinction. At the U.N., the Palestinians and their supporters can get all the nonbinding resolutions that they want at the General Assembly, but at the Security Council, they have always been stymied by the U.S. veto. The ICC, however, resembles the Security Council in its ability to provide meaningful support. But by design, neither the U.S. nor any other nation has the ability to block ICC action.    What Palestinian leaders ultimately want from the ICC is criminal indictment, not just of individual members of the IDF and Israeli Intelligence Services but, most importantly, of the national leadership of Israel. Their aim is to harass them as individuals, to delegitimize Israel by establishing as a fact that many of its top leaders have in fact, after this happens, in theory been indicted for war crimes.    Knowing the U.S. can't veto ICC indictments, they are seeking them as an illicit form of pressure against their ostensible negotiating partners.    I want to address this question of whether, in fact, this is a double-edged sword for the Palestinians. As some have suggested, maybe they should be subjected to questions before the ICC. But that is really not relevant to them, and it is important to understand that. Look no further than the ICC-indicted leader of Sudan, Omar Bashir, who is welcomed at Arab League summits and does not fear to travel in the Arab world. This demonstrates that within their region, Palestinian leaders have nothing to fear from ICC indictments. But Israel's region is the West. And, within the West, such indictments are taken seriously and will be enforced to the degree possible. This is just another example of Palestinians taking advantage of Western ideals and institutions, not to advance them but to weaken and delegitimize them within their region.    Ms. Pletka. There is no question we need to be careful not to cut off our nose to spite our faces in terms of aid to the Palestinians, and there are important parts of that assistance that go to the Palestinian people and that don't go to security assistance that again would cause more problems. I want to highlight something I left out from my testimony very fast.    Ms. Pletka. I am going to read you half a sentence from what AID reported to CRS as what a lot of the aid is used for: It goes to the PA toward paying off its commercial debt. Direct budget support will be used in the same manner as previous transfers to service debt to commercial suppliers and commercial banks.    Do you realize that aid to the Palestinians is going to pay off their commercial debts, that they are making all those choices on their own? That can't happen.    Ms. Pletka. Well, I think this goes actually to the question that Mr. Deutch asked as well, which is, you know, why go to the ICC right now? It is just a distraction. And I think for a lot of the countries that seek to internationalize their claims, not just the Palestinians, but others, it is an option for them where they can have their cake and eat it too. They are not subject to the penalties that come along with these because they are not actually part of a system of rule of law. And if you don't have rule of law, then of course, the jurisdiction of the ICC or of any other international organization is completely irrelevant.    Now, we haven't signed onto it, but this really is something that, you know, this is the reason that the American Service-Members' Protection Act was written. It is because these self-executing international organizations that are not subject to the veto of any particular country are increasingly popular with groups like the Palestinians but also others--the Cubans, the Venezuelans, the Irans, sadly, the Russians, and others who seek to use them. And frankly, most of them don't give a damn about the Palestinians. They care about going after us. That is why it is much more of a distraction.    As for Hamas, they don't care. Look, they just found a new headquarters. We were just talking about this. Where is their headquarters? It is in a NATO-allied country. Is that okay? Apparently. Apparently, yes, it is okay. You know, if it doesn't matter to them and it doesn't matter to us, guess what, it doesn't matter to anybody.    Ms. Pletka. I think for the ICC the question has always been whether the member parties, the party stays to the Rome Statute and the actual staff of the International Criminal Court care more about the institution or care more about their political axes to grind, and this is the moment of truth for them. If they go forward with this, with this completely contradictory, as you have all noted, this notion that an occupied territory that is also a state, that also has standing, that it can also bring a case against another country that isn't a party--we could go on with the contradictions here--if they decide that they want to go forward with this, then I think it is the beginning of the end of the ICC as a viable institution. That is a choice for them.    Ms. Pletka. But, Mike, I mean, we already don't cooperate with the ICC in any meaningful way. We don't provide them with any assistance. So, you know, those are nice words, but I don't think that they are going to be a death blow to the investigation.    Ms. Pletka. I think the law is pretty clear. And I think the legislative intent is also pretty clear. I think the time has come to put a stop to it. You know, I think that the simplest thing is something I have said to this committee many, many times before, which is that all aid should be visited on a very periodic and frequent basis.    Ms. Pletka. Stop it, look at it, and decide year to year exactly how it meets your needs. And this provides an opportunity to have that sort of strategic----
