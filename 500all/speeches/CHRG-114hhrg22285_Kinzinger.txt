    Mr. Kinzinger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And again, to our witnesses, thank you for being here today and spending some time with us.    Ms. Self, companies like Qualcomm have large patent portfolios because they have invested a large amount of money in new patents and the creation of new products. And presumably, many of Qualcomm's patents can be similar to patents held by other companies. When Qualcomm believes a similar company with a large patent portfolio may be infringing on its patents, how does Qualcomm open communications with that company?    Mr. Kinzinger. Right, I----    Mr. Kinzinger. I get that, and I will let you, on somebody else's time, can expand on that, but my question is if you have a company with a large patent portfolio----    Mr. Kinzinger . That you believe is impinging potentially on what you guys have, how do you open communications with that company?    Mr. Kinzinger. But----    Mr. Kinzinger. And, Professor, I am curious as to how private causes of actions have worked in the States. Have they been effective?    Mr. Kinzinger. OK, all right. Another--are there other theories rooted in tort law that would allow businesses or individuals to reclaim money that they lost to a patent troll?    Mr. Kinzinger. OK.    Mr. Kinzinger. And----    Mr. Kinzinger. And I have one more question for you. In your testimony, you mentioned Illinois and a couple of other States have taken a slightly different tactic on dealing with patent trolls; namely, they focus on specific acts or omissions that violate the statute, rather than prohibiting false or bad faith assertion. As I am sure you are aware, the business community in Illinois appears to be more comfortable with this approach. What lessons should Congress learn from this approach as we try to balance going after patent trolls with protecting legitimate communications between businesses?    Mr. Kinzinger. OK. Mr. Chairman, I will yield back. Thank you.
