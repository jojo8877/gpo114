    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Chairman Abraham and Ranking Member Titus, congratulations to both of you for your appointments, I look forward to working with you and helping you in this important subcommittee.    Mr. Lamborn. Anything else besides the video conferencing?    Mr. Lamborn. Yes.    Mr. Lamborn. Now, as you know we have added a lot of staff in Congress during the years I have been serving. And we have added incentives, financial incentives, to employees in the VA to do a faster and better job. Of course, we don't want to sacrifice either one of those, speed and accuracy. How are those incentives working, in your opinion?    Mr. Lamborn. And the incentives, are they helping the process as well, the financial incentives, bonuses, overtime, et cetera?    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you. My last question, within VBA, which Senior Executive Services, SES employees have their performance measured to include this important matter of appeals?    Mr. Lamborn. It is one measurement that you take, or one metric----    Mr. Lamborn . For evaluating performance?    Mr. Lamborn. Could myself, and the staff, and the chairman see these standards, please? We would like to see them in writing.    Mr. Lamborn. Okay, thank you so much. I will take that for the record. Thank you so much.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
