    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Admiral, for being here today.    Mr. Crenshaw. Your second trip. Glad to have you back.    You know, when you read the newspapers and you watch TV, you see a lot about terrorism and bombings and freedom fighters and foreign fighters, but listening to you talk really brings home the fact that this rapid proliferation of the whole missile area is one of the biggest threats to our national security. Even though we don't see it every day, we don't read about it, but your work is so vital, it really is one of the biggest long-term threats to our national security.    And when I heard you talk about what we are doing around the world, I wanted to follow up a little bit on the whole sea-based missile defense, because we have got--the Navy has a ship, I think they call it the LPD, and it has been a great platform and very capable, very flexible, and now they are going to build a new platform based on that using that hull, and a lot of people talk about that larger platform that might be valuable to have missile defense on that.    I know there is no money to do that right now, but I wanted to get your thoughts as you look to the future about how we deal with this very real threat. What goes through your mind in terms of our capability if we were to use a hull like that, larger, what would that bring to our missile defense, and maybe are there things we could do to test it, war games, something like that, because it seems to me down the road, that could be very vital.    Mr. Crenshaw. Is that the main capability that it would add? I mean, I guess larger, have more radar, have more missiles? I mean, are those things that you think about down the road?                                ------                                    Mr. Crenshaw. Gotcha. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you all for being here today. And I want to thank the Army for its leadership, including funds in the Future Year Defense Plan for the upgrade for the new tank, I think the ECP. I think you all know we have had some spirited discussions over the last several years about Abrams tank production, and I know it was your view initially that you weren't going to need any tanks for a while, so maybe the most cost-effective course of action would be to close down the tank production line and then open it up if and when more tanks were needed.    And this subcommittee thought it might be a better use of taxpayers' dollars to keep the tank lines open, spend about half as much as it might have cost to close it and open it up. I think that was estimated somewhere between $600 million and $1 billion. So we put some money to have a minimum production, keep the tank line open.    I think the next year foreign military sales were coming online, and there was a question would that be enough to keep the lines open, and we put a little more money to make sure that happened, and that kept that one tank production facility in our country from being shut down. And I want to kind of publicly thank the chairman for his leadership and thank you all for working with us to make sure that happened.    And do you care to comment about the ECP, about that program as you ramp that up?    General Odierno. Well, now, you know, what we said all along in the discussion earlier was about new tanks, but it is now going to be time for us, we have got to start now putting new changes to our current tank, the M-1A2 SEP, and so we will begin to do that. We are accelerating that now to maybe 2016, 2017 timeframe, and we will begin to do that inside of the Lima tank facility. And it is going to be critical. We knew all along we were going to have to do that at some time, and now that time is coming very quickly.    Mr. Crenshaw. Just a quick question----    Mr. Crenshaw. Yeah, I think we are in a good place now. Appreciate that.    I want to ask you quickly about Army training devices, simulation. We talked a lot about procurement. And it is always better to train live, but that can be expensive, and more and more people, the services are looking at simulation, renting these devices. You don't have to develop them, you don't have to maintain them. You can kind of let the private sector take the risk. And we put some money, I think, in 2014, or at least encouraged you to look at the possibility of using some simulation in terms of training, then moving into live training.    Can you give us your view? Have you done that? Has it worked out?    General Odierno. So, yes, we are doing that. Actually, we need more money. I would like to have more money to do it. It is absolutely essential for us. And what it does, it allows us to link installation to installation. So we can have a unit training in a simulator for a tank battalion or a Bradley battalion or company, and we can link them to an exercise that is going on at the National Training Center in Europe, and so it makes it more realistic. And that kind of thing is absolutely critical for us, as we want to build interoperability with our allies, but also it allows us to link with the National Guard and Reserve as well.    We are making progress, but this is an area I worry about because we have not been able to invest in it like we would have liked, and so what it does, then, not able to invest in this will cost us more money down the road to train, where if we could invest in it, it would lessen the amount of money we have to spend on training 2, 3, 4 years from now, and it is unfortunate.    But we have used that money. We think it is critical to our future to have that kind of training, it is absolutely essential for us, and it does save money as we go forward.    Mr. Crenshaw. Any obstacles that you have run into, anything we can help you with?    General Odierno. I think the main thing is just having enough dollars in order to do it. I think we have a good program in place, we know where we want to invest. It is a matter of having the amount of dollars to invest in it.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And let me add my words of welcome to all of you. Thank you for the work that you do.    You know, we hear, I guess we have heard in our hearings from all the different Services, talked about the impact the budget has on their ability to meet our National Defense Strategy. Obviously you are very important in terms of the well-being of the troops. Just common sense, if you are not well and your family is not well, you are probably not going to be an effective fighter.    So thank you for the work that you do. And as the chairman said and my colleagues agree, I don't think you will find a group of folks more dedicated to supporting the work that you do. So thank you for that.    I want to ask you about, particularly, General Horoho, last year we talked about malaria. I am chairman of what they call the Congressional Malaria Caucus, and so I like to keep abreast of what is going on. And when you were here last year, you said there were clinical trials that were going on, phase III clinical trials, and those have been completed now. And I think we all know, we have talked about the fact that malaria has all but been eradicated here at home, but it is probably the number one infectious disease that our military troops face. I was going to ask you maybe in a minute about when we had the Ebola crisis, how it impacted there.    But the big question is, tell us a little bit about, update us, the clinical trials are over, as I understand it. We have got vaccines for typhoid and yellow fever, but we still haven't developed a vaccine for malaria. And somebody said the mosquito is the most lethal insect there is. More people die from mosquito bites than just about any other animal or insect. So it is a big problem, obviously. Tell us what we are doing. Where are we in developing that vaccine?    General Horoho. Yes, sir. Thank you very much.    We do have a vaccine that is not efficacious for protection of our troops, but it is, what we have seen, efficacious for taking care of young children that are exposed. And so I think the power of that is that it shows that we can develop something that does the preventive measures, and so it will allow us to build upon that aspect of it.    We are also looking at the different types of medication that can be used. When we look at just the vaccine piece of this, the ability to really reduce the cost of health care, because if we could vaccinate, it is about a dollar per person, vice Malarone, which is about $100 per soldier, and then much cheaper, you know, with Doxycillin. And also the compliance piece.    So with Ebola, we had five soldiers that actually contracted malaria. We believe that it was probably due to noncompliance with the medication regime that they needed. All of them are all doing very, very well. But we continue to invest in that area.    Mr. Crenshaw. Do you think, will there be a day, for children, and I know it is devastating to children around the world, obviously. I mean, some of the appropriations we have given you in the Walter Reed Research Center. Where are we in terms of maybe the next step, not just children, but where it might be valuable, more valuable to our troops as they go?    General Horoho. I think continuing to ensure that we are aggressively funding and capitalizing on the research and the collaborative research that we have in our research centers in Thailand, and the Navy has theirs as well, to be able to make sure that we are learning from those labs that we have and that we keep the funding going so that we keep that collaborative partnership with the host nations as well as ourselves. I think that is going to be absolutely critical.    And when you look at the missions in which we are deploying more and more to, the threat of malaria is one of the biggest threats, and maybe the number one threat, about 50 percent risk there. And so I think in that area is to continue that pipeline of funding.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I have a question about when we talk about pharmaceuticals. This is something that just jumped out at me. I was reading, you know, that from 2000 to 2014, spending on compound pharmaceuticals went from, like, $5 million to $500 million in a 10-year period, and it was going to be $2 billion in the next 3 years. What gives? I mean, in terms of compound. I don't know exactly what a compound pharmaceutical is, but when it goes from $5 million to $500 million in a 10-year period. And it is still not--it is not a great percentage of the drugs, but it is, like, 20 percent of the cost. Are we working on that somehow? I mean, what has caused that kind of explosion?    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. And I would just say, I mean, that is astronomical.    General Robb. Yes.    Mr. Crenshaw. And the marketing part, I mean, if they are more effective, you want to make sure that we keep folks well.    General Robb. Yes.    Mr. Crenshaw. But if it is so wildly expensive, we have to make sure that that is the most effective and most efficient way to do that. So thank you.    General Robb. And that is the key. Many of these compounding pharmaceuticals don't have the data to back up the efficacy and the safety. And that is one of the primary reasons that, again, we are focused on screening those products, to make sure that they are safe and FDA compliant.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.
