    Ms. Sinema. Thank you, Chairman Fitzpatrick and Ranking Member Lynch.    Terrorism is an undeniable threat to our country's security and global stability. Terrorist networks constantly develop new ways to finance their deadly operations and threaten America.    Terrorists frequently leverage criminal networks for financing. To keep our country safe, we must be one step ahead of them, cutting off their funding and stopping their efforts.    The Islamic State is one of the world's most violent, dangerous, and well-financed terrorist groups. In 2014, ISIL generated approximately $1 million per day, predominantly through the sale of smuggled oil. That is why I have recently offered an amendment, which was accepted, to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to direct the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, to pursue efforts to shut down ISIL's oil revenues and report on resources needed for these efforts.    ISIL also recently captured the famed archaeological sites of Palmyra, raising the possibility that they will destroy or sell priceless artifacts to fund their militant violence. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to keep money out of the hands of terrorists and to find solutions that strengthen America's security.    I yield back.
