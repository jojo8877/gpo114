    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. I live in Arizona, and I spend about 10 hours a week in the air, so I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having this hearing because I think a lot about airplane safety. But I have a really practical question. I mean, I am really concerned about certification, but you know, oftentimes--well, not too frequently, but sometimes I am on a plane and the pilot announces there is a mechanical problem and we sit on a tarmac for a couple of hours. What kind of oversight is there over that repair at that moment when we are sitting in the plane? What kind of oversight standards is there--does these certification standards apply to that?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. So how may certification processes are we talking about here?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. But you acknowledge there are different certification standards for different----    Mrs. Kirkpatrick . Areas?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Right.    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. So suppose we go to the risk-based certification process, how long does it take someone to get to that standard where they can do that?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Here is my concern. We have data that shows that there is about 1,000 people shortage in the certification process, so you have 1,000 at the FAA.    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Right. What I am trying to get to is how can we streamline--what can this committee do----    Mrs. Kirkpatrick . To streamline that hiring process? That is a lot of people. We still have a lot of people who need jobs.    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you. And Mr. Hilkemann, I appreciate that you are hiring veterans. You know, we have very highly qualified veterans now who are back from Afghanistan and Iraq. Do you find that there could be a streamlining of the certification for veterans who may be already trained to do this kind of work but have to go through the whole recertification process?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Well, I appreciate that, and thank you for that. I yield back my time.
