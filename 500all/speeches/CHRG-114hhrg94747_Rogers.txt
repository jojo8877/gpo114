    Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    General Scaparrotti, I know that we are in discussions with South Korea's government about the deployment of a THAAD battery on the peninsula. Can you tell us why that would be important for the protection of our deployed forces in South Korea to have put on that peninsula?    General Scaparrotti. Well, the employment of a THAAD would give us a high-tier defense. And so, therefore rather--we would have a layered defense and those systems would enhance the capability of our present Patriot systems that are on the peninsula today.    Mr. Rogers. Okay.    Admiral, how many Chinese land-based cruise and ballistic missiles are located in your area of responsibility? And can you give me an estimate in the dozens or hundreds to keep it unclassified? And how many of these are between 500 and 5,500 kilometers in range?    Mr. Rogers. Okay.    Ms. Wormuth, when will the administration make a decision on INF violation responses? And has the Principals Committee even met on this issue?    Mr. Rogers. They have been noncompliant for years. How much longer is this going to go on?    Mr. Rogers. Yeah, in order to keep them into compliance, we have to get them in compliance, and they haven't been for years and they are not going to be. I hope that you all will start talking more seriously about some consequences.    Admiral, with China increasing its capability in nuclear attack submarines, ballistic missile submarines, and even aircraft carriers, how do those developments and deployments affect U.S. force structure and planning?    Mr. Rogers. Do you believe that the U.S. Government should be making it a priority to ensure that China is not able to obtain U.S. technology in our defense capabilities?    Mr. Rogers. Thank you.    That is all I have got, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
