    Mr. Latta. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and very good hearing today and thanks to our panelists for being here today.    If I could start, Mr. Sadredin, if you would like to respond if you can remember exactly what Mr. Mirzakhalili comments on--exceptional events. Could you comment maybe on what he had commented on?    Mr. Latta. Thank you very much.    If I could turn to Mr. Matheson, and this has come up before. But when you see that the National Park Service released data that at many national parks--this is the Joshua Tree National Park, Sequoia, Kings Canyon National Parks, even Yosemite--had ozone exceedances in 2015 you note in your written testimony that many rural Western national parks, the canyon lands in Utah are located far from any emission sources yet routinely are above the new ozone standard levels of 70 parts per billion.    And so I guess my question is are you concerned that from many parts of the western United States there may be few if any options I know we just heard a little bit about, but what options are there then to complying with this--these regulations? How do you do it?    Mr. Latta. Let me interrupt for one second because, again, I am from Ohio. We have 88 counties. My home county is one of the top 10 counties in size. It's 619 square miles.    I noticed Yuma County--I did a quick check--is 5,519 square miles. You know, we are looking at size differences and you are lumping everybody together as a county. How do you adjust for that and how do you account for it? How are you going----    Mr. Latta. Thank you very much. My time has expired.
