    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I thank all the witnesses for their testimony today.    Mr. Wise, while the GAO report does not include an exhaustive list of agencies with leasing authorities, is there a particular reason why the VA is not included in the report?    And I will explain to you why I am asking you this question. I represent the southernmost district in Florida, and we have many veterans who live down on the Florida Keys, and oftentimes these people have to drive long distances in order to get the quality care they deserve. Sometimes they do not even get that, but that is a separate issue.    So I wanted to pose a question and see if there is anything we can do by working together to remedy this situation.    Mr. Wise. Yes, thank you for your question.    Actually I think the short answer to that is VA now goes through GSA for its leasing.    Mr. Curbelo. OK. So you do not foresee any role or any opportunity for us to work on this. I would have to be exclusively through GSA?    Mr. Curbelo. OK. Well, I thank you, and I look forward to working with you to remedy this situation because, again, sometimes we have veterans driving 3 and 4 hours in order to get care, and if we can do anything to expand access to care, it would make a great difference to the people in my district and I am sure this is something that happens throughout the country.    So thank you both very much.    That is all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.    Mr. Curbelo. Mr. Lapiana?    Mr. Curbelo. Mr. Wisner, how does GSA ensure that its tenant agencies do not lease more space than they need?
