    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And welcome to the panel.    There has been much discussion here today about parents and the advice they get about having their children vaccinated or not vaccinated. I would like to ask it from yet another perspective. Yesterday, a United States senator asserted that routine vaccinations could cause, and I will quote, ``walking-talking normal children to wind up with profound mental disorders.''    And so my request of the panel is a simple yes-or-no response. Is there any shred of credible evidence that shows that this, in fact, is the case? Dr. Schuchat?    Mr. Tonko. Dr. Midthun?    Mr. Tonko. Dr. Robinson?    Mr. Tonko. Dr. Fauci?    Mr. Tonko. Pardon me?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you for clarifying.    In addition to promoting vaccination, Dr. Schuchat, how else does the CDC work to prevent spread of the flu? For example, does the CDC recommend symptomatic individuals to stay home from work?    Mr. Tonko. Are there any data showing how many flu transmissions occur in the workplace when symptomatic individuals do come to work?    Mr. Tonko. Um-hum.    Mr. Tonko. I do know that in speaking with my constituents, there are a number of working moms and dads who can't afford to take time off of work because it would mean they are not paid, and so they attempt to come to work even though they really shouldn't. In your opinion, would paid leave policies help to prevent the transmission of the flu and other illnesses by encouraging more workers to stay home when they are indeed sick?    Mr. Tonko. OK, thank you.    Dr. Midthun, the FDA has licensed a number of new vaccines since the year 2009. How have these new vaccines contributed to preparedness efforts in the last several years?    Mr. Tonko. And, doctor, in your testimony you talked about work to speed up the manufacturing process for existing vaccines. Can you tell us more about that work?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you.    Mr. Tonko. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
