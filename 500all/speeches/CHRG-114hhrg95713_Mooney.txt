    Mr. Mooney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Ehnes, in your testimony you singled out an experience where law enforcement set up a check station. Can you elaborate on what created an issue there and possibly damaged trust with the Forest Service?    Mr. Mooney. Thank you for expanding on that.    Sheriff Brown, a question for you. I have one of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Training Centers in my district, actually in the county I live in, and I have toured it. They are good people; but I also understand you've got to have as clear as possible lines of delineation of whose job is what, who enforces what, where your demarcations are.    In your opinion, what do you view as the proper role of Forest Service law enforcement officers?    Mr. Mooney. And we have a minute left on my time, Sheriff, but a follow-up.    In addition to understanding the proper roles, accountability would also be important. It appears sometimes issues between law enforcement agencies can boil down to personalities, but they fester on because of lack of accountability from various Federal agencies.    So in your view, what are the options available to increase accountability?    Mr. Mooney. Thank you.    I yield back my second.
