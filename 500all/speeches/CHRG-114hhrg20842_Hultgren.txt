    Mr. Hultgren. The gentleman from Illinois yields back.    Chairwoman Comstock apologizes. She had a commitment in Transportation Committee that she had to run to, but I will yield myself five minutes for questions.    Just to follow up on Mr. Lipinski's question, Mr. George, if the IG says that even at the lower risk level the IRS process is not NIST-compliant, is that correct?    Mr. Hultgren. If the IG says that--yes, so if you say that at the lower risk level the IRS process is not NIST-compliant, is that what you're saying?    Mr. Hultgren. Okay. Let me get to some of my other questions. First, I do want to thank you all for being here. The federal government certainly does have a massive cybersecurity problem, as we've seen most visibly with the OPM data breach. We need to be doing more across the board to prevent, identify, and thwart cybersecurity attacks.    I had the opportunity to visit the Department of Energy's Cybersecurity Team at Germantown to get a crash course on the bad actors that exist. I also saw how easily a company or agency can find itself vulnerable. NIST develops the guidelines that all federal nondefense agencies must follow. For industry, they are minimal, a voluntary floor for our security. And it seems to me, however, that an agency can just ignore these rules, placing massive amounts of sensitive private information of my constituents at risk.    Mr. Koskinen, if I can address this to you. In regular business someone is usually responsible to accomplish their task and are held responsible for their failure to do so. IRS unfortunately has an abysmal record in holding their officials accountable, as we saw with the Lois Lerner incident a few years back. If you don't get fired for discriminating against political organizations and destroying evidence, I don't know how you would ever get fired at the IRS.    Mr. Wilshusen spoke about the enforcement actions that the federal government and said that he does not know that OMB has ever taken any action.    I appreciate your seemingly lamenting statement about the burden of mandates such as ObamaCare that they have on your agency, but all agencies have been strapped. And I think keeping my constituents' private information safe should be one of the highest priorities you have.    What internal actions have you taken considering you are still noncompliant with basic NIST and OMB standards?    Mr. Hultgren. I would say in certainly the most high-profile situations we haven't seen that accountability and my constituents haven't, and they still are very fearful of their information.    Let me address--I just have a minute left--to Mr. George. In your prior testimony, Mr. Koskinen had stated that access to the ``Get Transcript'' application requires multistep authentication. Is multistep the same as multifactor authentication? If not, what is the difference, and could the use of the term multistep be disingenuous as it might confuse people into thinking they are the same?    Mr. Hultgren. Okay. Well, again, thank you all for being here, appreciate your work. This is obviously an ongoing concern for our constituents. They're frightened, quite honestly, of what could happen and might happen if their information is compromised. So I want to thank you all for being here.    And I'll yield back the balance of my time and I will thank the witnesses for their testimony and the members for their questions. The record will remain open for two weeks for additional written comments and written questions from members.    The hearing is adjourned.
