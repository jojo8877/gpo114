    Mr. MacArthur. Thank you, Chairman.    I had, if I remember right, had read that the total savings from your TRICARE recommendations were about $6 billion. And I just want to understand what of that is the result of structural changes and what of that is the result of increased cost sharing with our military personnel?    Mr. MacArthur. You lost me a little bit I am afraid.    The first $4 billion--you mentioned $5.2 billion in utilization changes. So that is savings. Two billion in increased cost to personnel, I guess in the form of either rising premiums or co-pays or however that is fleshed out.    And then you mentioned a $4 billion that got you up to that initial $11 billion. What was that $4 billion?    Mr. MacArthur. Help me understand the accrual funding. I am not sure what you mean.    Mr. MacArthur. Savings against what other option? Savings against funding it in the future without accrual?    Mr. MacArthur. I may want to visit with you later on that. I think I am beginning to understand what you are talking about. I am not sure I understand exactly where the savings are coming from there, but I get the concept.    Mr. MacArthur. So if--and this is just a conclusion--if we rejected the--and I am not saying we should, but if we said there is enough change here, let's not also make our military personnel bear some cost, and we didn't shift $2 billion, we would still save $11 billion on this conversion to private health care networks as opposed to TRICARE. Is that a correct conclusion?    Mr. MacArthur. I thank you. I yield back.
