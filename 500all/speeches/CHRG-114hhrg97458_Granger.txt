    Ms. Granger. Yes. Thank you for being here and thank you for your service.    Admiral, Iran and North Korea are both known to engage in weapons proliferation and technology transfer. Your agency states that increasing technology transfer and missile proliferation could render traditional deterrence and diplomacy ineffective against a future missile attack. Can you tell me, in terms I can understand, how you are ensuring this doesn't happen?                                ------                                    Ms. Granger. Could I follow up with a question? The chairman asked this, but with what you just described and how important that is to our future, vital, if this Congress can't get rid of sequestration and has to come in at those numbers, what programs are you going to have to pick and choose on to do what is immediate but not long-term, or how are you going to make those decisions, how will it affect what you just described?    Ms. Granger. Thank you. You know, and I hear you. We all do. I think we have had testimony here going through this and asked that question so many times, but the importance of not just what we need to protect us, but our commitments to our allies is extremely important, and I am glad that you mentioned that. We haven't talked a lot about that.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Granger. I asked earlier what decisions you have to make if sequestration stays in effect. It seems to me that we are losing--or we have lost our technology edge. I mean, what you just described what China has tells us that.    If we were to say, all right, what is it going to take, not for you just to not have to cut things, but to regain that edge, to be able to come before this subcommittee and say, yes, we are still ahead, we are the ones who are doing things? What would that take?    Ms. Granger. That is all right.    And let me ask you this: This group that is putting the numbers together and looking, do they have a deadline?    Ms. Granger. Good. Because I would hope you would and back to this subcommittee and report as that is developed.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Ms. Granger. I had the opportunity to work with Marcus Luttrell on an issue. And in meeting with him, he talked about some very extremely effective treatment he had had at the Carrick Brain Centers in Las Colinas, Texas. They are doing really amazing work with servicemembers who are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury. And I toured their facility and talked to some of their patients. In fact, I sent some that had come to me with problems that they were not getting the treatment they needed, and since they were on a grant could fill that with Active Duty military. Unfortunately, it is still extremely difficult for servicemembers to receive treatment there, especially while they are on Active Duty.    During this hearing last year, I asked what needs to happen to make medical treatment by organizations outside of the DoD more readily available to our servicemembers.    Director, your colleague, Dr. Woodson, said that you needed to work out a system to provisionally cover these kinds of evolving practices and create more flexibility in the program. My question is, what progress have you made in this regard? Are you any closer to making these services more accessible than you were a year ago?    And for years I asked how we are going to have the persons to treat all those that are coming home for two of the longest wars we have ever had, and the answer essentially was we are going to grow those physicians, which I knew was not going to service the numbers we have got. So tell me how you have progressed in making treatments like those outside of DoD available.    General Robb. Yes, ma'am. One of the what I would call modernization efforts just in the last year that is going to allow the Department of Defense healthcare system, Military Health System, to move forward, is the creation, and actually through the support of the NDAA, is what we call emerging technologies and treatments. And so we have created a construct within the Department of Defense Military Health System to where we will take these emerging technologies and treatments and take a look at them, to look at, again, the safety, the efficacy, the data that either shows that the outcomes are as either stated and/or predicted.    This will allow us to stay on the leading edge of health care. As you know, the Department of Defense Military Health System is governed by statute, and as a result we don't have necessarily the flexibility that some of our civilian healthcare systems do. But this will help us, again, under what I call a legal framework, to be able to do that. And we are excited about that. And if that is one of the things that looks promising, then we will absolutely take a look at it, yes, ma'am.    Ms. Granger. And so that can be looked at now, right?    General Robb. Yes, ma'am.    Ms. Granger. You are saying that program already exists?    General Robb. Yes, ma'am. We just stood it up. Yes, ma'am.    Ms. Granger. Well, I would hope that you would look at that. And I toured, and when I talked to people being treated there, I know, for instance, in strokes that you say the first 6 months were just magic. Well, they were treating stroke victims that had a stroke 7 years before and were progressing. So I just think for our military, those that are outside of that DoD could be extremely helpful rather than having someone spend the rest of their lives with some of the injuries they have.    Thank you.    Ms. Granger. Could you just give us an update on the electronic health records? Tell us, do you have concern about the schedule, do you have concerns about the interoperability with the VA, kind of a general across-the-board where we are.    General Robb. I will take that one. So I believe with, again, the effort that we have generated with a partnership with AT&L, and also with the Military Health System and the integrated program office, I believe that we have got a nucleus of folks that have got us to where we need to be as we move forward.    As you know, the electronic health record request for folks to submit their bids was last fall, and right now we are in the process of reviewing all those proposals. We should have a selection for the electronic health record vendor by mid to late summer.    After that, we will then use, beginning in the fall, we will use the next 6 to 9 months to take that electronic healthcare product and run it on what we call our virtual laboratories to run it, kind of what I call put it in the wind tunnel and test it, to see how it works both in the garrison arena and also in the operational arena.    Then, in the late summer and early fall of 2016, we will roll it out to the Pacific Northwest, which will be the first region, which will be a tri-Service, which will be Lewis-McChord, Bremerton, and Oak Harbor.    And when we roll that out, then we will take a pause after that. So take just about 9 months to a year to go from IOC to FOC. But we will take the lessons learned from that, take a short strategic pause, and then what we have is we have a series of regions. We basically have five regions in 24 waves that we will roll out across the Nation, and it will be about a 6-year rollout plan.    Ms. Granger. And the interoperability with the VA?    General Robb. Okay. So the interoperability with the VA, again, there are several fronts on that. That is first and foremost on what I will call our objectives. As you know, there was a decision made unilaterally by the VA to pursue the VistA, and then we made a decision to move forward with a commercial off-the-shelf product that we believe will keep pace with the industry.    As you know, 2007 there was only about a 40 percent use of the ER. Now, as of last year, we are up to 78 percent in the commercial sector. So the capabilities of the electronic health records out there, again, that capability and technology has exponentially risen, and so we believe that is the most cost-effective way for us to move forward and to keep current what we call generation four and generation five.    It is also going to cost us probably around $3 billion less to go with a commercial off-the-shelf product than it would have been for us to create our own and build our own healthcare record.    Now, the interoperability piece of it, we have been working hard, both the Department of Defense and the VA. You don't need to have the same electronic health record for them to be able to talk back to each other. As you know, the banking industry is a prime example, the travel industry is another, but what they have to agree upon, what they have to agree upon is a common language or a common data set for them to be able to talk back and forth.    I know the Department of Defense is basically on time and on target currently to meet all of those, what we call the ONC meaningful use criteria definitions, and I know the VA is right there with us. And so when it comes time for the two records to talk and we down select ours, I believe that we will be there.    Now, remember also, the Department of Defense has to talk to the VA, but 50 percent of our health care is delivered for our beneficiaries in the civilian healthcare system. And so we are also looking at opportunities for us to talk, again, through meaningful use and for common data elements with the civilian healthcare sector with our new electronic health record.    Ms. Granger. Yes.
