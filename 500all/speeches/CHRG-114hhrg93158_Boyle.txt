    Mr. Boyle. As a new member, I have to learn to hit the button that says talk.    Thank you, Madam Chair and also Ranking Member Deutch.    I would just briefly say that with the ICC application, something that has happened in the last several months that deeply concerns me is the increase in an effort in the international community to isolate and stigmatize Israel. I am deeply concerned that this latest effort is merely yet another attempt in this long-going campaign, especially by those countries, not the United States, but other countries in Europe and elsewhere that are otherwise allies of the U.S. So I am very interested in what we can do as a country to stand up for Israel, to stand up for human rights of all people, and to ensure that the ICC isn't corrupted and used and abused in a way that is really just about bashing Israel. Thank you.    Mr. Boyle. Thank you, Madam Chair.    I was wondering, given that we are about 6 weeks away from Israeli election on March 17 and especially given the constant jockeying that is happening between Hamas and the Palestinian authority, I was wondering to what extent you believe the next 6 weeks will be a destabilizing time for the Palestinian community and Palestinian leadership, particularly given that the latest polls in Israeli election show it literally within possibly one seat?    Mr. Boyle. Did anyone else have a comment on that?    Mr. Boyle. Well, that is certainly logical--and we would expect that--although, in one sense, one could say that the leadership or the behavior of Palestinian leadership has, in many ways, dictated Israeli elections all the way for the last 20 years.    The other question I had was, especially given what happened in Lebanon just in the last week, the latest on the relationship between Hezbollah and the Hamas. I know that is a little bit more broad than specifically the ICC issue, but of course all these are interconnected.
