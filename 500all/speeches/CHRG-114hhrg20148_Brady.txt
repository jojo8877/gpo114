    Mr. Brady. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you for holding this markup today.    Rather than speak to each of the resolutions individually, I will submit longer comments for the record and just make a few comments here.    I support these four resolutions. The updates to our handbooks and committee guides are long overdue. Some of the updates we are making here sure should have been made 10 years ago, so it is good that we are doing this today.    I appreciate your working with my staff on these proposals. We have bipartisan agreement on all of them, and I will be supporting all of them. We approached this process wanting to make our House work better, and I think we did that. Commonsense updates and some basic reforms will hopefully result in less work in the administrating of our offices, and some of these proposals could actually save some Members money.    I also support the ECMO proposal, and I am glad we consulted with Employment Counsel on the final draft. I would specifically like to thank Gloria Lett and Ann Rogers of the Clerk's Office for their help.    This proposal makes things easier for these Member organizations as we implement these new regulations. I hope that we continue working together to resolve any unexpected issues. I look forward to continuing to work with you, my friend from Michigan, and urge my colleagues to support the resolutions before us today. Thank you.    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman very much.    Are there any other Members that wish to have an opening statement?    The chair recognizes Mr. Harper from Mississippi.
