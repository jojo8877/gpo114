    Mr. Lujan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Ray, this is a surprise to me, sir, but I also had the honor of working with Ray Baum and learning from Ray Baum back when he was a utility commissioner and I was on the New Mexico commission as well. And it has been an honor working with you, Ray. Many successes and I look forward to continuing to work with you. You are a great, great person and you truly are an asset to America. I look forward to learning from you and working with you in your future endeavors.
