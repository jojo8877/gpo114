    Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, the Santa Claus question. Both of you mentioned that you would like to have more money. How much? And for what?    Mr. Cooper. Thank you. Now the Scrooge question. Pentagon is the least auditable of all government agencies. It has been a risk factor for the GAO for 20 years, the number one risk factor. Will your IT work help the Pentagon get audited faster?    Mr. Cooper. Well, some people would say 2017 is next year, not 2 years away.    Mr. Cooper. Doesn't sound like you are very optimistic about meeting the deadline.    Mr. Cooper. Okay, now the long-awaited question of the ghost of Christmas past. The Joint Chiefs hack, there was apparently somebody who signed on to an e-mail, like the equivalent from the Nigerian prince or something. Has that person been identified who opened that foolish e-mail? And would it help if they were identified, if they not been identified previously?    Mr. Cooper. I see my time has expired, Mr. Chairman.
