    Mr. Keating. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is great to welcome a graduate of Wareham High School, in Massachusetts, Ms. Davis. And it is a pleasure to be here. I am in the next town over in Bourne, and I am sure we are all proud of your success and the work you are doing in this regard.    I wanted to touch base on something I think is just as important too, and that is how important your work is for males and young men. I mean, a mother is a child's first teacher, and particularly in other countries in the world as well as domestically. Empowering mothers to have this information, to have this access, we have found with investments in USAID, that money is better served empowering women and mothers, because it goes better to the health of the children, the welfare of the child, but also the education of that child. So can you speak a little bit about how empowering this is for mothers--how it is for young boys having a mother that is more in a position of having these resources?    Mr. Keating. Yeah. I don't know if any of the other witnesses wanted to touch base on that?    Mr. Keating. Are you aware of any concerns to the--you know, this is an enormously powerful tool to mobilize people around a common cause, particularly internationally, but are you--not every country in this world, unfortunately, has the greatest of missions and purposes right now, and there are very oppressive governments and terrorist groups that are out there.    Do you come across any concerns that in the hands of some of these countries or groups with deep packet technology, that they can identify who is using these kinds of technological tools and target them? And if that is the case, is there something we can do about that?    Mr. Keating. Okay. Thank you very much. I yield back.
