    Mr. Gowdy. The gentleman from Maryland yields back.    The chair will now recognize the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Walberg.    Mr. Chair, I yield back.    Mr. Gowdy. The gentleman from Michigan yields back.    The chair will now recognize the gentlelady from New Jersey, Mrs. Watson Coleman.    Mr. Gowdy. Yes, ma'am.    Mr. Gowdy. Yes, ma'am.    Mr. Gowdy. The gentlelady yields back.    The chair will now recognize the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Grothman.    Mr. Gowdy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Harris, I made a note, the ranking member in his opening remarks said that sexual harassment was intolerable and had no place in the Federal workplace. And if you heard him today and hear the passion with which he speaks on this issue, you will know that if he were in charge it would be not tolerated and have no place in the workplace.    Mr. Gowdy. But he is not in charge. And it appears to me that it is tolerated, prevalent. And, really, the only consequences are consequences for the victims, not the perpetrators.    Mr. Gowdy. The chairman, whom I laud for calling this hearing, began to get into some of the specifics with you, and that is precisely what I am going to do.    No names, no identifying characteristics at all, but I want to know, how many victims and witnesses to the harassing conduct were there?    Mr. Gowdy. All right. So there are 10 victims of sexual harassment.    When did the conduct begin?    Mr. Gowdy. All right.    Now, we use the word ``conduct'' because it has such a benign-sounding name to it. I want you to describe for our fellow citizens what that conduct was. What did these victims have to endure?    Mr. Gowdy. Well, I think he had already done that.    And, to the extent that he had not, we are going to keep going. I read hugs, kisses, placing his hand on the knees of several women. Is that correct?    Mr. Gowdy. Rubbing their arms, upper and lower backs. Is that correct?    Mr. Gowdy. And, again, this is going on since 2002?    Mr. Gowdy. Well, let's just go with the most--let's just go with what we know we can prove.    Mr. Gowdy. 2002. We have a combination of victims and witnesses who were forced to watch this, whom I also consider to be victims, numbering 10.    Mr. Gowdy. Gestures, remarks, and other sexual innuendos. What were some of the remarks and innuendos that these victims were forced to endure?    Mr. Gowdy. So you have conduct dating back to 2002. You have double-digit victims. You have conduct that is by any definition sexual harassment.    Mr. Gowdy. Now, I want you to tell my fellow citizens all the consequences that the perpetrators suffered.    Mr. Gowdy. A reprimand.    Mr. Gowdy. How would you get a reprimand for this conduct? Is there any ambiguity as to whether or not it is acceptable? Is there any ambiguity as to whether or not it is illegal?    Mr. Gowdy. It is actually a crime----    Mr. Gowdy. --to touch someone when the touching is unwanted. It is actually a crime.    Mr. Gowdy. Well, I hope it gets remedied. This workplace environment is criminal.    Mr. Gowdy. And whatever consequences befall this perpetrator would be insufficient, in my judgment.    I yield back to the chairman.
