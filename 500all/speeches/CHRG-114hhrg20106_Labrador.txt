    Mr. Labrador. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the witnesses for being here today.    Mr. Groves, can you briefly describe the difference between a treaty and an executive agreement?    Mr. Labrador. So, in your opinion, is the Paris Agreement a treaty?    Mr. Labrador. So can you briefly discuss Circular 175, or C-175, and the justifications that it gives to view the Paris Agreement as a treaty?    Mr. Labrador. Can you discuss the State Department Circular 175, and whatever justifications it gives to treat the Paris Agreement as a treaty?    Mr. Labrador. So what steps or actions can Congress take in the future to ensure that a treaty negotiated by any Administration, whether it's the Obama, or the Trump administration, or any other Administration, follows the proper course of action and is properly submitted to Congress?    Mr. Labrador. Maybe it might be a good idea to do it during an election year because we don't know who the next President is going to be, so maybe both parties can actually work together on something like this.    Mr. Labrador. What recourse does Congress have right now if an Administration refuses to submit a treaty to Congress?    Mr. Labrador. Okay.    Mr. Kontorovich, I think I'm pronouncing that right, what's the significance of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change accepting the Palestinian Authority as a state party?    Mr. Labrador. Does this signal then a shift or a change in U.S. foreign policy?    Mr. Labrador. Thank you, I yield back.
