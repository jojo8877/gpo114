    Mr. Buck. Thank you.    This question really goes to both of you, and feel free to take it in whatever order you'd like, but you talked about how these grazing practices could improve the land. Have the Federal agencies been open to your suggestions on this issue?    Mr. Buck. Give me the long one too.    Mr. Buck. Ms. Schwartz, have you had any experience working with the Federal Government on these issues?    Mr. Buck. Okay. Let me ask you something. The chair mentioned something that's interesting to me. I guess it's the role of the fence in terms of grassland management or range management. With the vast ranches that we have in Colorado and Wyoming and the west in the high arid desert, how do we create the incentive for our four-legged critters to move from one area to the other to accomplish the goal that I think you're both talking about?    Mr. Buck. Now, you're talking to a prosecutor, so make sure you use the word ``predator'' carefully, because I used to prosecute a lot of those folks.    Mr. Buck. Okay.    Mr. Buck. Thank you.    Thank you, Chair. I yield back.
