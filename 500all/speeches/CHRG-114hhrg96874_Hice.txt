    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Dubowitz, do you believe that the BDS is going to positively or negatively impact the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Well, would you go so far as to say, again, in your opinion, that BDS really is a threat to Israel as a Jewish state?    Mr. Hice. All right. You mention a couple things. Defending our allies is one thing, but you said this is a threat to America, as well. In one or two sentences, what is the threat to America?    Mr. Hice. Mr. Kontorovich, let me ask you, how much of a threat do you believe that this poses to Israel's economy as well as their overall security?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Thank you.    Let me go back, Mr. Dubowitz, to you, then. Does Congress, in your opinion, do we have any options? Is there anything legislatively that we can or should do towards or against private organizations that are funding the BDS movement?    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
