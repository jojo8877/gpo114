    Mr. Takai. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and really thank you very much for having this hearing. As many have mentioned, this is a very important issue for all of us here and definitely for our constituents back at home.    I looked at the request from the President in the form of this joint resolution, and under section (c) limitations it says the authority of the grant does not authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces in, ``enduring offensive ground combat operations.''    So my question to you on the panel is, what does that mean? Does it actually refer to the length of time during which the operations will be ongoing for 3 years? What is the scope of the operation, from your perspective? And is it, in fact, some undefined relationship between time and scope?    Mr. Takai. Okay. I have another question, and maybe you can help me with this.    So there have been many mentions, I mean, if you take a look at the language it also repeals the 2002 AUMF, but my reservations are in regards to the still-in-effect 2001 AUMF. So my question is, and in fact, many people have already said it, the conflict that we are in right now, what is happening right now is based on the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, so what is your perspective with the fact that the 2001 AUMF will still be in effect based on this draft? What does that mean?    I mean, we are currently operating with those two AUMFs. Is, in fact, this particular draft necessary to continue operation?    Mr. Takai. Okay. And then one more question, and I guess we will have to wait for your response in writing, but I am just questioning why you think there was no geographical limitations put in this current draft. So if you can think about that and maybe send us the information, I----    Mr. Takai. All right. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Mr. Scott.
