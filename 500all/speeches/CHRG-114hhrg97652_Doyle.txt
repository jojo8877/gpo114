    Mr. Doyle. Thanks, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the witnesses for your testimony today.    Mr. Davis and Mr. Kennedy, I have heard some concerns from some of the public safety community in Pennsylvania about who will qualify to use FirstNet, who will make the final decisions about eligibility. Beyond police, firefighters, and other first responders, there are other individuals and organizations that play an important role in emergency response. Shouldn't States ultimately decide who has both permanent and temporary access to the first responder broadband network? For instance, if a building is on fire, and police or firefighters, they might find it very valuable to be able to communicate with the building security, or those in charge with managing the evacuation. Shouldn't the incident commander in these cases be able to make the final decision about who has access to the network?    Mr. Doyle. Great, thank you. Mr. Kennedy, first responders in Pittsburgh, and many other cities across the country, use the T band for communications, and, as part of the Spectrum Act, the FCC will reclaim that spectrum. Do you see the deadlines that are set for that process as being problematic for first responders that depend on that spectrum to communicate, or do you believe FirstNet will be online in the effective localities in time to mitigate this shift?    Mr. Doyle. Great. Gentlemen, thank you. Mr. Chairman, I will yield back.
