    Mr. Brooks. Secretary Cohen or Mr. Scheeler, whoever prefers to answer, in your investigation, have you discovered any other instance where EPA limited or stopped a project using Section 404(c) before any permit applications have been submitted?    Hon. Cohen. There was one incident that I'm aware of, and Mr. Scheeler can amplify it. Out of the 43-year period of time in which this Act has been in law, there've been 13 occasions when 404(c) has been called upon only after the filing of a permit. The one exception to that was a case in Florida in which there were three contiguous parcels, and in two of those three parcels there had been permits filed and giving the opportunity for EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers and others to participate. Based upon their examination of those three contiguous properties, they decided that there was no need to file a permit in that one exception in Florida based upon the same characteristics, same area, different ownership. They said no need there, we've looked at all of the information from the Army Corps of Engineers and all who had participated and were satisfied this is the right course of action. There was one minor exception, and that was only after two of the three participants in the mining proposals had filed permit applications.    Mr. Brooks. Are there any underlying facts that would suggest to you that the EPA's use of 404(c) in the Florida instance was justified while it's not justified at the Pebble Mine?    Mr. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
