    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you y'all for being here. We appreciate what you do. Nothing more important than our children, and especially their education.    Let me ask you, when we are talking about this information, are we talking about specific information to a specific child? Or are we just talking about general information? Are we talking about, you know, at this school, 40 percent finished in this percentile?    Mr. Carter. Are you more concerned with the--I suspect that you are more concerned with the personal data on the specific student than you are about the general data.    Mr. Carter. Dr. Abshire, when your school system gives the information to a company, do you sell it? Do you get a price? Do you get paid for it?    Mr. Carter. That helps. One last question.    Are there any physical characteristics including in this information? You know, male, female, gender--    Mr. Carter. Thank you all again.
