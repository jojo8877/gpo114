    Admiral Syring. Thank you, sir. Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to testify today. I am going to deviate a little bit, sir, and go into the thread of my opening statement here to give context, and then questions that will come from that.    Our budget request for fiscal year 2016 maintains the commitment to operate and sustain our homeland defenses, including the planned deployment of 44 GBIs by the end of 2017. This request supports test requirements as we continue to enhance the stockpile reliability program and undertake component aging testing in order to understand and maintain the health of the deployed system.    The testing plan in 2016 includes a non-intercept flight test to evaluate alternate divert thrusters and support algorithm development for discrimination improvements for the homeland defense. We will also continue development of the redesigned kill vehicle (RKV) for improved reliability, availability, performance and produceability. The first test of this RKV is planned for 2018, the first intercept test will be 2019, with initial deployment in 2020.    We started acquisition planning and pre-construction activities for the long-range discrimination radar (LRDR). We anticipate contractor award for this radar by the end of fiscal year 2015.    Our 2010 budget request supports the deployment of standard missile block--Standard Missile-3 Block IBs, and beginning in 2018, the IIAs on ships and at Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland. We plan to procure 209 SM IBs by the end of 2016, and will request multi-year procurement authorization. We are also planning to deliver 48 additional THAAD interceptors to the Army, for a total of 155 by the end of 2016.    And, finally, our advance development technology and development efforts will ramp up this year. We will continue our discrimination sensor weapons and technology common kill vehicle program, which includes the early concept exploration of multi-object kill vehicles, and technology maturation initiatives. These investments will help us to deploy a future BMDS architecture more capable of discrimination and killing reentry vehicles with a high degree of confidence. Our low-power directed entry resource is focused on providing a forward tracking capability.                                      ------                                    Mr. Chairman, the threat is moving forward rapidly and progressing at an equal pace. We will continue to pursue--aggressively pursue cost reduction measures of all the acquisition programs through competition, partnering and cooperation as we continue to deliver the most--best missile defense capabilities to protect our Nation, our deployed forces, friends and allies at the lowest possible Cost to the American taxpayer.    Thank you, sir, and I look forward to the questions.    Admiral Syring. No, sir, you are not. But, again, I would--I would emphasize in the concentration today, which I can intelligently comment on, is delivery systems of that material in terms of where are they with long-range development of an ICBM class that could potentially deliver a weapon to the United States.    Admiral Syring. The answer in terms of what we are doing in eastern Europe from a missile defense standpoint is sites that are in Romania and Poland, as you are aware, Aegis Ashore sites that will provide defensive weapons against the short and medium range threats from Iran.    The concern that I hear and get asked about is, what about defense of those sites from Russia? And it is more, sir, of a policy question at this point, because we didn't design those sites against Russia. They have no capability against the Russian ICBM. So the question--I answer the question from a policy standpoint is, and that will be driven by the combatant commanders if and when do we decide that we have to protect those sites. That is the danger I see.    Admiral Syring. Yes, ma'am. If I can, Mr. Chairman, I am going to use the $1 billion figure that was in your opening statement, if sequestration comes down at a billion dollars. My budget is roughly just over $8.1 billion request, and so I have got to come up with $1 billion in execution here, and I have got two very important fence posts. Homeland defense is the number one priority of the Department, and then the commitments that we have made in Europe to our allies of the European approach. So you would see me protect those at all costs, because those are our two top priorities,at the sacrifice of the new START development programs, which we haven't talked about yet, in terms of designing a new kill vehicle.                                ------                                    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. I understand.    Admiral Syring. Okay. If I can just take a couple of minutes, Mr. Chairman, and describe, and then I think that'll help set the context here. And I will go around the world, but I will start here with the homeland.    The homeland defense system currently today is 30 ground-based interceptors, mostly in Alaska and a few at Vandenberg; 26 and four is the split that we use. These provide our long-range ICBM defense against Iran and North Korea. System wasn't designed and never has been designed against China or Russia in terms of what they could possibly shoot at us.    This homeland defense system is just not interceptors, it is also a fire control system that is up in Fort Greely. There is a missile field up there that has all the operation. The command and control center is in Colorado Springs, along with what NORTHCOM fields there. There are radars around the world. To the east, there is a radar in Thule, Greenland, and Fylingdales, England. Those provide us the tracking capability of a potential threat from Iran. And to the west there is a radar on the tip of the Aleutians, Shemya Island, Cobra Dane and Clear, Alaska, as well.    There are data terminals that provide updates to the interceptors as they are detected by these sensors that would then cue the engagement from Fort Greely for mid-course defense intercept.                                ------                                    The regional programs around the world were, as you know, actively deployed with PATRIOT around the world. I think there are eight of the 16 batteries deployed today. We will have delivered four of the seven THAAD batteries to the Army by the end of this year. There is a lot of noise in the press, and you have seen it, on when and if we will deploy a THAAD battery to South Korea. I am not going to get into that. That certainly is going to be, you know, Mr. Work and General Scaparrotti and the Secretary's decision on how to do that. I have been very quiet about that publicly. It is the warfighter's decision. And I think you will see them work towards that decision in the future. So----    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. So 33----    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. 33 BMD ships today, meaning the capability of firing SM-3s, and then rapid progress on a Romania Aegis Ashore site, which is essentially, think of a DDG and take the deckhouse and put it ashore to give us protection, to give us protection of our forces and our allies in eastern Europe. And then when Poland comes along, we will extend that to more central Europe, and then there will be ship stations that cover the entire continent by 2018 against short and medium-range threats from Iran.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. I agree, sir.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. Sir, let me just answer it in the context of what we have today and what we are doing to answer the combatant commanders' requirements, which today exceed the number of ships that we have to provide. And it is only going to grow as EPAA is fielded in 2015 and 2018 in terms of the number of BMD-capable ships it is going to take to satisfy, not just the ship station requirements in Europe, but over in the Pacific as well and in the Central Command area of operation. It is growing exponentially in terms of the demand curve for those ships.    And then I was just with the CNO last night. The other part of his problem, sir, is being able to cover the carrier strike groups and do Navy operations and get ships around the world to do things other than BMD. So you have got a rapid, you know, request from the combatant commanders for BMD ships, not enough ships, us trying to modernize ships as fast as we can, and so I think that is the first part of the answer.    On the LPD, I have seen the concepts, and they have merit and--but we are not pursuing that in terms of--we are down more the Aegis modernization path at this point. But down the road, additional sensors are helpful, any type of sensors are helpful. And I push our allies in Europe for sensor contributions, so I would push us as well.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. Right. Thank you, sir. The environmental impact study (EIS) is going on. It has been going on since early 2014. We are on track to finish that in final by mid 2016. And there has been a whole body of work done, hearings held, you know, environmental surveys done at all of the four sites, and Ohio being one of them, Camp Ravenna. And that--we will need to go through one more season here at one particular site up north in Maine just because of the seasonal limitations, and that will be rolled into the draft EIS, which will be published later this year. We will have another public hearing on that, finalize the report and send it over.    We have also been actively working the contingency plan that was mandated by the NDAA, and this is, how would you deploy it and what are the details behind that. It is very thick. It is non-site specific, but very detailed in terms of the planning that would go on.                                     ------                                    Admiral Syring. We have not requested anything to ask the environmental impact studies. It is roughly 5 years after authorization and appropriation to complete a site. We know how to do it, we did it in Alaska, but it is a matter of a budget and need at this point.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. Sir, in this classification----    Admiral Syring . I just--I want to be----    Admiral Syring. I want to be careful on the offensive side.    Admiral Syring. I don't want to get cross with Admiral Rogers, who is a four and I am a three, so I will be very careful.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. It is a great point and a good question that they have raised, and I addressed this last year, too, in terms of we are catching up from a long lull of the failures back in 2010 in terms of experiencing a very hard problem with an inertial measurement unit vibration issue that nobody saw and was very hard to replicate on the ground. We had to actually build a test bed to go replicate this on the ground. We successfully took that back to a non-intercept flight and then an intercept flight in June of last year.    Now, that successful intercept flight was necessary but not sufficient for the long-term health and fielding of the program. What that allowed us to do was field the next eight, and it informed the upgrade of the next eight to that configuration in terms of now we have been through a successful non-intercept and an intercept flight test. I went to the warfighter, I said, you know, I am confident that that test did everything that we expected, and we are good to put the next eight in.    The next flight test will be--next intercept flight test will be the end of 2016, and there is another upgrade coming, it is called the CE-2 Block 1, but it is primarily an obsolescence upgrade to parts that aren't available anymore that had started back in 2010. And we own a lot of those parts, we bought a lot of those parts. It is a matter of finishing the integration at some cost, but that flight test will inform us and the warfighter on whether we proceed with deploying those interceptors in 2017. And it will be my advice, depending on--you know, we would have to understand the failure and why it failed, but if it was an unknown with that interceptor, it would not be my recommendation to field those.    And I would like to be in a better position if it had been, you know, 2010, but we are playing catch-up here, so the idea is to flight test that before we deploy it since we have already bought all of the parts and must integrate them now.    In the future, the redesigned kill vehicle will be non-intercept tested and will be intercept tested before the decision is made to buy the production assets. And to me, that is where we want to be long-term in terms of flight tests and then decision, as opposed to buying all this material and interceptors before the flight test is complete.    Now, you know, we were in a position just on the history of the program well before I got here in terms of decisions that were made, but I think, sir, we have had this discussion, is we want to be at least in flight before you deploy, and at best, I think in the future, fly before we buy. Now, we are going to have to buy some test interceptors to go prove that, but before we make the production buy, I think it is vital that we go through an intercept test. And the program in the future's laid out to that, and then you will see us if we go to MKV, same approach in terms of that, by 2025.    Admiral Syring. The biggest offer in this year's budget is the THAAD-extended range concept development in terms of let's start that development to give us the capability to push a defensive system out to range to defeat that threat.                                ------                                    Admiral Syring. We are.    Admiral Syring. We have the----    Admiral Syring. They are.    Admiral Syring. I am sorry, at 2,500 kilometers.    Admiral Syring. CSS-5 Mod-5 fielded by China today operational holds our----    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. Holds our carrier battle group--could hold our carrier battle group at risk. The----    Admiral Syring. I don't.    Admiral Syring. I don't. Let me take that for the record.    Admiral Syring. The important program that you all supported is the sea-based terminal missile defense program that is a modification of the Aegis weapon system and the Standard Missile 6 that will protect the carrier battle group. We are going to test that this summer.    Admiral Syring. Yes.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. Sequestration would jeopardize the increment 2 development of that program, which is where we think we need to be for the future. It is the seeker modifications and the SM-6 that need to go on to provide at the advanced capability.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. That is correct.    Admiral Syring. Ma'am, there is an active effort in the Pentagon to address that very question you are asking in terms of Mr. Work has come in, Mr. Kendall have been very vocal about our reduced research and development technology and the very fact that you state in terms of losing our edge. And there is a group, large group stood up that are going through the priorities of where do we think the technology priorities are, how much more investment needs to go into those priorities to address that very question.    Sequestration, for me, in terms of--I am just trying to hold what I have. And I think I have provided you a recommendation with this budget to hold what I have and do the necessary improvements to Mr. Ruppersberger's question, about I may be fielding a capability next year to defend the carrier, but it does us no good if, by 2020, China has moved that threat further. And for missile defense, the future is so important as opposed to just concentrating on what we can do today, because the threat is moving so rapidly.    We haven't talked about this much, but directed energy has been a big focus for us in this budget in terms of increasing our investment for both discrimination and tracking capability, but maybe even more importantly, a boost phase intercept capability, where you now can start to think about, to some of the demonstrations that you are aware of that we did with airborne laser, you know, a decade ago, you know, can you field a meaningful boost phase intercept capability. And to me, for missile defense, that is the technology edge that we need to be at. Multiple kill vehicles on one interceptor is a technology edge where you can think about shooting one with four kill vehicles on it, and you don't care if you have picked out the RV or not. And to me, that moves us ahead.    Some of the other programs that I am not as familiar with but I know exist are the DARPA in the Air Force and the Army hypersonic live vehicle programs that they are attempting to get off the ground, and I think proving that it is not easy. And that is what I put in context with China, is that they have demonstrated it, but to move it to the ranges that we are talking about is a very difficult problem; not that they can't do it, and they will try, but that is another step ahead.    But, ma'am, to your point, Mr. Kendall has been articulate on the fact that we are losing the edge, and sequestration would further erode that.    Admiral Syring. Sir, we have more than--and it is across multiple exhibits. You know, there is hundreds of million of dollars in directed energy, both classified and unclassified, that are asked for in this budget.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. Ma'am, I will take that for the record. I am sure they do, and there is a schedule, and I do have people participating on it, but we are not leading it, so let me take that and get you the details on when they are going to get the results.    Admiral Syring. I will, ma'am.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. The Japan Cooperative Development program was an agreement that we reached with them to cost share on the SM-3 IIA development. It was about a $3 billion development. They paid a billion dollars of that development cost. We will flight test that, sir, in May for the first time; not intercept flight test, but we will fly that missile off California here in a couple of months.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. They did a marvelous job with the nose cone and sort of front end section of that missile that allowed us to concentrate on integration and the larger aspects. I wouldn't say that we got anything from them that we didn't know, because they were sort of in a--they are in a follow arrangement since we are the lead, but I wouldn't say there was anything intellectually that was new with the IIA from them, but they are manufacturing and what they are doing and their contribution is important.    The other one I will shift is to the east with our THAAD case with UAE. I mean, to me that is just a great example of them buying THAAD from us, lowering our overhead on that program in terms of interceptor quantities and price. They actually funded some of the needed obsolescence upgrades that were funded in the FMS case that we didn't have to fund that we needed anyway, so we are leveraging that. And those are the two near-term development efforts that we have got going.    There is talk, and only talk at this point, of if we start a THAAD ER program, would the UAE or any of the gulf coast--any of the Gulf Cooperation Council partners want to participate in that. And we will actively look for that participation if the policy supports it.    The other part, sir, is over in Europe. We can't continue to pull it alone, and we need sensor contributions first from countries in Europe. We are actively pursuing discussions with Spain, and you have probably read about Denmark and Norway's potential. And being able to use those ships and their radars and network, and there is going to require some information-sharing agreements obviously, but to have them pull some of the load on sensor contributions to the protection of Europe is what I am pushing, because we cannot continue just to pound on the United States Navy to take those stations for weeks on end.    To me, they have got to step up and contribute. They all want to develop an interceptor capability and think about that, and I dissuade them in terms of let's focus first on sensor and radar capability, because that is where we see the most help.    Admiral Syring. Sir, let me take that in two parts. The interceptor, meaning missile-industrial base that I rely on for ground-based interceptors, for the THAAD system, the Army relies on Patriot and the Aegis SM-3 interceptors, they are, I wouldn't call it healthy, but I wouldn't call it in dire straits in terms of work that is out there and projected future work.    I am going to continue to buy and hopefully someday have multi-year procurement in SM-3. We will continue to buy THAAD, we will continue to upgrade that.    We had a robust competitive field for the long-range radar in Alaska, with three companies coming in, with competitive proposals in terms of that sensor technology. So you would hear me start to get worried about radar technology if I got, like, one or two bidders to that, but we had three, and it is very competitive proposals delivered that we will select by the end of this year.    And that, coupled with the Navy's Advanced Missile Defense Radar, AMDR program, some of the other Air Force and Army awards, and then my desire to continue to improve sensor capability for Hawaii next and then to the east coast as well; it is not perfect, but I think it will keep that field going.    I don't have in the interceptor and the sensor area maybe as large a concern as we would have in the ship-building industrial base, for example. I think that the capability is out there and the competitive field is pretty ripe.    Specialty metals, we continue to watch and understand the importance of that in terms of what it could do, and have to go through very detailed requests and waivers when we are deviating at all from that, but we have tried to eliminate that entirely.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. Absolutely. Yes.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. That would be the first step.    Admiral Syring. Right. And you have got to have a stable platform. The only way you can do that is to be above the clouds.    Admiral Syring. China is beginning to work on a missile defense system, from what I read in the intelligence.    Admiral Syring. No. Not yet.    Admiral Syring. They have an older system that protects Moscow today, nuclear-based, so, you know, sort of a point defense system, but certainly not a country-wide defense system.    Admiral Syring. THAAD, since it----    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. Since it was redesigned, as you are aware, it went through a redesign back in the mid 2000s; it has been 11 for 11 with flight intercepts and most recently last year, and we are going to test it again this year, this summer as part of the operational test. And I would like to keep it on a cadence of at least, you know, at least one a year, maybe one every 2 years to continue to prove the system.    Admiral Syring. They are going through acceptance testing today and they will deliver later this year.    Admiral Syring. The other countries are more about sensor contributions from ships that they have.    Admiral Syring. Not anything in the queue for THAAD.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. Today, yes, sir. In the future, we will hold an offer--or a solution for Hawaii----    Admiral Syring . And for the east coast as well.    Admiral Syring. Sir, the reason it is not needed is because against the current threat, the east coast is protected today with the inventory that we have.    Admiral Syring. The ground-based interceptors that are in Alaska and Hawaii----    Admiral Syring . Because of the trajectories that would come over the pole.    The second part of that answer is that the pace of long-range ICBM technology and demonstration is behind where North Korea is, in my view. And our first focus, given limited budget and resources, is to take care of the North Korea problem first, and then as we watch Iran develop, think about what is necessary for radar and a potential east coast site, in that order.    Admiral Syring. Sure,    Admiral Syring . Two very important upcoming David's Sling tests. And then you will see the Israelis consider, I think, do we operationally or declare IOC and do they deploy that, and I think that some of that is the premise for their budget request this year. Again, I just want to have the context. We are still in development with the system.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. But, again, that--certainly possible, but, again, I think that what I will advise you on is the maturity of the system and the success of the flight testing regime and whether we think that that is a good investment for production dollars today.    Admiral Syring. Correct.    Admiral Syring. Co-development in the sense that we provide the system engineering and technical test expertise to them.    Admiral Syring. We have co-production today with Iron Dome, but----    Admiral Syring . There has been no agreement on that for David's Sling or Arrow.    Admiral Syring. Thank you, sir.    Admiral Syring. Sir, I assume you are talking about directed energy?    Admiral Syring. Sea-based. And what the other parts and Services are working on with ship-based solutions is vital, but it is a much shorter-range problem than what I am dealing with with ballistic missiles. In terms of where you need a ship to be positioned to be able to intercept an ICBM from North Korea, for example, you can't have it close enough to be effective.    And then the other complicating factor would be the cloud cover in terms of once you detect, you have got to be able to track it through clouds, and when you have a 50 percent cloud cover in North Korea, that defensive system on a ship would be limited. But, again, what they are working on is very, very important for the other missions of the Navy and the Army.    Admiral Syring. Sir, the EPAA was formulated back in 2009, and certainly was envisioned earlier than that in terms of the concept, but in terms of implementation, Phase I was implemented in 2011, which involved a ship station and the radar to Turkey; Phase II will be fielded and is on track by 2015; Phase III, that is in Romania; and then Phase III will be in Poland.    And I have been to Romania probably a half a dozen times in the last year. It has not been without difficulty in terms of the completion of that site, but it will complete by the end of the year as promised and as scheduled. The Army Corps is a big part of helping us with that.    Poland is on track, and with your help this year with the MILCON that we need in 2016, that will remain on track and field by 2018.    The IIA missile which Mr. Visclosky asked about is critical to that development and will be fielded to Poland in 2018.    And so to answer your question, yes, it is on track and we have made the commitments.    Admiral Syring. No, sir. Just eastern Europe, Romania and Poland.    Admiral Syring. Yes, we do, part of one.    Admiral Syring. Today there are 24 deployed to the island.    Admiral Syring. The warfighter, General Scaparrotti hasn't decided that yet, but there is talk of it.    Admiral Syring. That would provide the defense of South Korea, a large part of South Korea from the shorter range missiles from North Korea.    Admiral Syring. Not the entire country, but a significant portion of it.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. And we have deployed forces there that are very, very important to protect. And I know General Scaparrotti is heavily involved in that decision, along with General Dempsey.
