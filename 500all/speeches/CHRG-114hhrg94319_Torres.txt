    Mrs. Torres. Thank you. Director Salerno, in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, a number of safety reforms have been enacted or implemented, including the establishment of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, as a separate entity charged with regulating drilling operations on the Outer Continental Shelf. This has led to improvements. I should say much improvement in processes for inspection, investigating, and enforcement.    But we have also heard about the role human error and inadequate training programs played in this tragedy. A competent and highly trained workforce will play a key role in preventing these types of disasters in the future.    My two questions for you are, can you expand on the challenges the Bureau is facing regarding the recruitment and retention of skilled workers? And, two, which job classifications are the most difficult to staff? And what steps is the Bureau taking to remedy the situation? Included in that is pay scale.    Mrs. Torres. And, if I may suggest, incentives for years of service may be an area where you can look at.    I would like to yield the rest of my time to Congresswoman Dingell to allow you time to finish answering her question.
