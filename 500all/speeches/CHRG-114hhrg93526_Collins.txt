    Mr. Collins. Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Collins. You can't, or not possible, or don't want to?    Mr. Collins. Well, you are reading a letter----    Mr. Collins. Will he yield?    Mr. Collins. Well, I will be happy to give your time back, if you put it in proper context. The letter, which----    Mr. Collins. Well, because when you left the room the other day I talked about----    Mr. Collins. Well, 3-to-2 right now.    Mr. Collins. I just wanted to clarify again, and we did this last time. It is Groundhog Day. Here we go again.    The letter spoken of, which I went through this about a month or so ago, was dealing with legal permanent residents. It was not dealing in this discretion of illegal or crossing--it was not dealing in this issue. So basically to take a letter at the time when things were taken out of a 1996 legislative reform in dealing with this, let us at least be fair with the letter. And to come up here and to use a letter, and take people who are no longer in this body, who no longer can defend themselves, and even some who happen to be here and just not on this Committee, to say that is just wrong.    I believe the gentleman from Illinois has a good heart. I just believe he is dead wrong on many things dealing with this. This is one though, let us at least have an honest discussion about this. Let us not at least throw in names so you can make yourself basically appear an argument that is not there. This is what is wrong right now with this. This is what is wrong with this argument. This is what is wrong the American people to get.    And I appreciate the gentleman yielding. And with that, I yield.    Mr. Collins. Probably equally.
