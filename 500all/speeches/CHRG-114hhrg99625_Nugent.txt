    Mr. Nugent. We know the Asia-Pacific is a key region for illicit trafficking of everything from counterfeit goods to narcotics to humans. How do you see illicit trafficking networks affecting U.S. policy interests in the Asia-Pacific region and what assets and capabilities do we have to tackle these threats? Additionally, are we seeing any indications that any of these illicit funds are being used by foreign terrorist organizations, or local insurgencies in places like Thailand or Burma, to support their operations?
