    Mr. Palmer. If the gentlelady would yield, I'd just like to point out that the GAO recommendations from last year are in this year's budget that was passed by the House.    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I really love the work you guys are doing. This is--having run a think tank for 20-something years, it's right in my sweet spot. So I commend you for the work you're doing and hope you'll keep it up. Just have a couple of questions about the work you did on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the potential for generating revenues by getting that down to a 90-day reserve. I think we're in excess of that right now.    Mr. Palmer. On the private sector that's holding 141 days, do you know if that includes what's sitting in tanker cars because they've got nowhere to go with it right now?    Mr. Palmer. That's the good news. The bad news is is that I think at that time the price was about $65 a barrel and we're down to $52 something or----    Mr. Palmer. I'm also looking at the reserves that the Federal Government owns in places like the Green River Formation. I think there's some interest in expanding our research into the outer continental shelf and the potential for generating revenue to meet our revenue needs, everything from infrastructure to defense to running the government, are enormous.    Let me ask you--let me switch horses on you here for a moment and go back to the IRS, and I don't know if the GAO has any ideas on this, and that is the fact that I think we only collect about 84 percent of the taxes that are owed us. I think we wind up collecting some additional amounts, but on a year-to-year basis. And that has to do, I think, with the difficulty of pursuing these cases, the cost. Does the GAO--have you looked into this and do you have any recommendations for what the IRS could do to facilitate this so that we actually collect the money that's owed us?    Mr. Palmer. Thank you for your work.    I yield the balance of my time.
