    Mr. DePRIEST. Chairman Hardy, Ranking Member Adams, and members of the Committee, good afternoon. As the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to appear before the Committee today to discuss the office and its accomplishments during fiscal year 2015, which I think is responsive to some of the issues that you raised in your opening statements.    I have provided my complete testimony, and I ask that it be entered into the record. It includes all of Advocacy's recent activity, which I will just summarize in these brief remarks.    When the Office of Advocacy was first created in 1976, it was charged with providing small businesses with an independent and credible voice in the Federal rulemaking process. Too often, small businesses were unduly burdened by one-size-fits-all regulations from Federal agencies. During the past 40 years, the Office of Advocacy has facilitated greater consideration of small-business impacts through economic research, regulatory flexibility trainings, comment letters, roundtables, publications, and collaboration with Federal officials throughout government. As a result, Federal agencies treat Advocacy as a partner in the rulemaking process in an effort to reduce the regulatory burden on small business.    As the seventh Senate-confirmed Chief Counsel, I will ensure that the office continues to work with Federal agencies to mitigate the potential costs of regulation on small entities. To further describe our dedication to this cause, I would like to update you on Advocacy's efforts and accomplishments on behalf of small business during fiscal year 2015. During this time, Advocacy hosted 21 roundtables to highlight the concerns of small businesses on a wide range of topics, from OSHA standards to FAA regulations. In addition, Advocacy submitted 28 comment letters to 15 different agencies on a variety of issues. Specifically, the majority of these comment letters addressed either, one, the need for flexible alternatives supporting small business; two, inadequate analysis of the impact on small entities; three, improper certification of the rule; or, four, requests for greater outreach to small entities. The office achieved more than $1.6 billion of first-year cost savings as a result of its efforts on behalf of small business. Generally, these savings come from the difference in costs between the proposed rule and the final rule.    Advocacy's efforts have also produced positive outcomes that are not quantifiable and are not captured in these cost-savings projections. Advocacy's work with Federal agencies and engagement with small businesses often helped facilitate greater consideration of small-business concerns and Federal rulemakings in Federal initiatives. For example, Advocacy's engagement with officials from the Food and Drug Administration produced more flexible regulations on animal food controls. Similarly, our work with the Federal Communications Commission improved competitive bidding rules.    Advocacy's approach to Federal agencies has also included facilitating greater compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act throughout the government. Since 2002, Advocacy has conducted formal trainings on RFA compliance for Federal agencies and other stakeholders. In fiscal year 2015 alone, Advocacy conducted trainings for 126 Federal officials from a variety of different agencies, exceeding our annual goal by more than 25 percent. In addition to these formal trainings, Advocacy offers Federal agencies technical assistance regarding RFA compliance. Since its creation, Advocacy has provided timely and policy-relevant information on important issues affecting small businesses. During fiscal year 2015, we released 26 research publications on several topics relevant to today's economy.    Finally, the 10 regional advocates who are part of the office play a vital role in maintaining an open dialogue with the vast majority of small entities that operate outside the beltway. They interact directly with small-business owners, small-business trade associations, and State officials to educate them about the benefits of regulatory flexibility. This past fiscal year, Advocacy's regional advocates participated in more than 500 outreach efforts, exceeding their annual goal of 360.    In closing, I would like to thank the Committee and its staff for its continued support of the Office of Advocacy. As chief counsel, I look forward to working closely with you on the important issues of affecting small entities across this country. Now, if there are any questions, I would be pleased to answer them.    Mr. DePRIEST. Certainly. I am blessed with having a terrific staff that has been through this process repeatedly, especially as we move toward the end of this administration, to make sure that every regulation that is proposed goes through the Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis and is analyzed for its effect on small businesses.    We will continue to do the things we do, such as the roundtables, coordinating the panels, doing the analysis, having our economists look at it, everything that we can do to make sure that while an agency is able to achieve its regulatory goal, at the same time, we are looking for ways to minimize the effect that any proposed regulation would have on small businesses.    Mr. DePRIEST. Thank you. The office has, under the amendments to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, particularly the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, has the ability to file amicus briefs in court if there is a legal challenge to a regulation. The comment letters that we write, such as the one that you referenced, can also be used as evidence in court to see whether the agency has complied with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Now, insofar as whether there is more that we need, in talking with the staff, we found that the vast majority of agencies comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Our mantra is better information, better rules. So we try to put small businesses together with the agencies so that they get the input from small businesses. For example, in the waters of the United States, we did conduct roundtables with representatives of small business, with the EPA, and with the Corps. So they heard the concerns of small business. And we will just have to see, as we go forward, as we monitor the situation, you know, what effect it has. Now, I understand that that particular rule has been enjoined by the courts. But we will continue to monitor it.    Mr. DePRIEST. Thank you. We solicit, insofar as our economic research is concerned, we solicit ideas from the small-business community, from Members of Congress, from members of this Committee, from the mother SBA of what they might want us to research. And in that process, we try to pull together what our research agenda is going to be for the year. Now, insofar as minorities, that is a special focus of the office. When the office was created, the statute creating it specified that we are supposed to do research on issues involving minorities. As a matter of fact, we are doing some research right now on minorities in the technology area, minorities and immigrants and what their effect is in the technology area. As a matter of fact, in a couple weeks, I am going out to San Francisco and Silicon Valley to talk with individuals who are involved in the effort of increasing minority entrepreneurship. And at that time, we are also going to present our research on what is going on and things that can be helpful. So we are mindful of our requirements to do so, and we actively do it and do it as best we can.    Mr. DePRIEST. Yes. I believe that it is. In talking with the members of the staff since I have been there, I believe that it is a sufficient amount of money for us to carry on our activities.    Mr. DePRIEST. Yes, I believe they have. As I said during my opening remarks, we calculate that we saved businesses in the first year $1.6 billion. And that is the difference between what the agencies proposed as their initial rule and what they ended up with after consultation with us. We think that is a significant savings. As I said, there are other savings that are perhaps not as quantifiable, but we think $1.6 billion is significant savings. We are constantly looking for ways to represent the interests of small business. As I said, we do roundtables where we try to put the small businesses together with the agencies. We help with the panels. We do everything that we can to be the voice of small business and reduce the burden. Now, I think that the executive orders that the President has issued, some of which lead to actually looking back at regulations and see whether they are still remaining in force, you know, we do that. We help the agencies put together an agenda for doing that lookback. So I think that we are on the right track there.    Mr. DePRIEST. Yes, I can. The CFPB has really embraced the process. I did have the number here. I would have to get it to you, but they have done a number of the panels that they are required to do. And, in some instances, you know, we think that there has been a benefit insofar as the rules that they were thinking about versus what they proposed. So even though it is a newer agency, they come at it and we come at them with the history of what we have been doing with OSHA and the EPA. And I would say that the agency has embraced that process.    Mr. DePRIEST. I see. Yes, we do that. And we will continue to monitor that.    Mr. DePRIEST. I think that what is working is that the agencies are listening to the concerns from the small-entity representatives and implementing less burdensome regulations. To follow on with Congresswoman Velazquez' comment, particularly with the CFPB, they have held six of the panels since 2012. Some of the issues involved mortgage loan origination and arbitration and payday lending. And we think that we have seen some benefits here. For example, with the mortgage servicing rule, small entities which service less than 5,000 loans are exempt from some parts of the rule. And so that was a result of the agency listening to the concerns of small business.    As I said earlier, the mantra is, you know, better information, better rules. And these panel processes allow small businesses to be directly involved in the process of writing the regulations. And I think there is definitely a benefit to that.    Mr. DePRIEST. I would have to really look at that and talk with my staff about their experiences with that. My understanding is that we have helped agencies map out a plan for how they do their 610 compliance. And I would like to have the opportunity to talk with the staff to see whether that is a possibility. Now, I know that later on this year, I will have the opportunity to present some legislative priorities. And I will take a special look at that to see whether that should be one of the ones I recommend.    Mr. DePRIEST. Well, I actually think that the quotation that you made really does sum it up. I mean, when we were first presented with this rule, we held several roundtables across the country--three in Washington, one in New Orleans, and one in Louisville--on this issue. And the letter that we wrote was really based upon the comments, the small business concerns that these changes will add significant compliance costs and paperwork burdens. We are going to actively work with DOL to seek regulatory alternatives that have been recommended by small businesses. I mean, one of the ones that they are really concerned about is the difference between--or how this regulation would affect those in low-wage states versus others. One of the reasons we went to New Orleans and Louisville was because dollars are spent differently in those regions. And we have been advocating for the Department of Labor to take that into account. Now, we understand that the DOL plans to release their rule later this year. So we are looking at it anxiously to see what they determine.    Mr. DePRIEST. I don't have any further information on that.
