Ms. Kastrup, in your testimony, you indicated that there continues to be a high level of uncertainty in the long-term care market that affects premium rates. Can we ever expect long-term care insurance premiums to stabilize as more claims experience becomes available?    Mr. Walberg. But is there any reasonable guess when it might stabilize?    Mr. Walberg. That could change prediction, ultimately, of----    Mr. Walberg. That's comforting for me to know, having bought long-term care. So thank you.    Mr. Doughty, recently, John Hancock announced that it was going to discontinue selling new standalone, long-term care policies because there's limited demand for the product. Why is there limited demand for the product?    Mr. Walberg. Any other factors, specifically for your company, go into making the decision----    Mr. Walberg. The decision to discontinue selling.    Mr. Walberg. Did you consider what that means for individuals who have purchased standalone policies?    Mr. Walberg. Will there be substantial premium increases for these individuals?    Mr. Walberg. On standalone, those that have purchased it.    Mr. Walberg. Okay. Well, thank you for your testimony.    I yield back and recognize Mr. Lynch for your 5 minutes of questioning.
