    Mr. Meadows. Thank you all for being here. It's good to see you back, a few of you.    Mr. Starr, I think part of the frustration is that you answer with such specificity and inclusiveness that it's hard for any of us to take some of your testimony seriously that everything is okay. Now, I've talked with your colleague a number of times, have a good relationship, I believe, with her in terms of trying to find areas to address the embassy and diplomatic needs that we have.    So I guess the question I have for you is, I heard Mr. Linick talking to Mr. Hice about the need for clarity. So would you say that some of the ``not following the rules'' is because of ambiguity in the law?    Mr. Meadows. So why are we not following?    Mr. Meadows. So whose fault is that? This committee? Because I'm willing to take this committee to task if they haven't made themselves available.    Mr. Meadows. Well, but let me get back to the question. I only have 5 minutes. Because I've been able to spend time with Ms. Muniz in my office. She came after a hearing and said, you know, ``Is there anything that we can offer?'' We've had follow-ups since then. You know, it's that dialogue. And while we may not agree on everything, we were able to come to an understanding on a number of issues.    And so I guess my question is, if there is not a lack after ambiguity, other than informing us, what's the problem, Mr. Starr? Are we going to come in under budget? Are we going to come in? Are you going to----    Mr. Meadows. So we may require appropriations to finish things?    Mr. Meadows. But does the ends justify the means?    Mr. Meadows. Well, it's not a question that you have to look at. It's a question of law. And what Mr. Linick----    Mr. Meadows. --has pointed out is, is that there seems to be either ambiguity or the lack of following what has been laid out. Which is it?    Mr. Meadows. All right. So there's a lack of following----    Mr. Meadows. So everything's okay?    Mr. Meadows. All right. Hold on. Let me let her----    Mr. Meadows. You've been talking a lot. Let me let her jump in. She wanted to jump in. So let me----    Mr. Meadows. And as you know, I understand that. I guess the real question is the American taxpayer dollars. At what point are we so sure that those standards are met? Because Mr. Starr has indicated there are a number of waivers that they have continued to give, maybe not on London, but on other projects, and yet he says that we're following all the standards, and those were your words in quotes, all the standards. So why would you need a waiver if you're following all the standards?    Mr. Meadows. That's not the question.    Mr. Meadows. I didn't ask that.    Mr. Meadows. Mr. Starr----    Mr. Meadows. Mr. Starr, it's your testimony that suggested that there's waivers and that you followed all the rules. Those two are mutually exclusive. It couldn't happen.    Mr. Meadows. Mr. Starr, with all due respect, that's apples and oranges. We were talking about new construction. Have you done any waivers with new construction?    Mr. Meadows. On new construction? All right. Will you get that to this committee?    Mr. Meadows. Thank you. I'll yield back.
