    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to yield my time to our colleague on the full committee, Mr. McKinley from West Virginia.    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Dr. Miller, for being here.    In your testimony, you mention that different post-acute care settings treat similar patients, but Medicare pays them different rates depending on the setting. Can you explain why this happens and how much authority CMS has to fix it compared with what is in the statute?    Mr. Guthrie. OK.    Mr. Guthrie. OK. And you also stated that the Commission has frequently observed that Medicare's payments for post-acute care are too high and its payment systems have shortcomings. Why do you believe the payments are too high and what are the system shortcomings?    Mr. Guthrie. And shortcomings in this payment systems.    Mr. Guthrie. Yes. Right. On the payment systems.    Mr. Guthrie. And I got real--just a couple of seconds.    Mr. Guthrie. But the Commission, in your statement, you said the Commission studied difference in outcomes in SNFs and IFR settings but couldn't compare risk adjusted across that. Was there a reason why you couldn't do the risk adjustment?    Mr. Guthrie. OK. Thank you. I yield back.    Mr. Guthrie . Thank you, Doctor. This is all, I mean, very good. And I appreciate what you are doing, but we are going to try to get some questions in before votes.    Mr. Guthrie. So I appreciate that.    Mr. Guthrie. And you did--it is a great discussion.    Mr. Shimkus from Illinois is recognized.    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. The chair now recognizes Dr. Schrader from--or Dr. Schrader from Oregon for 5 minutes for questions.    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. Gentleman yields back.    The chair recognizes Dr. Murphy from Pennsylvania for 5 minutes.    Mr. Guthrie . Thank you. The gentleman's time is expired. We are really pushing votes. Let me recognize the gentlelady from California, Ms. Matsui.    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. The gentlelady yields. Be advised we are in votes now, so we will probably be able to get to one more 5-minute set of questions. Then we will reconvene following votes, probably about 12:15 we walk off the floor.    Mr. Griffith, from Virginia.    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. Yield back. And since you yield back some time, I am going to recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Castor.    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. The gentlelady yields back. And I believe we concluded the questions for the first panel, but the committee will recess, and once we recess, we will reconvene following the last vote, and we will commence with the second panel at that--we will begin with the second panel at that time. The committee is in recess until call of the chair after the final vote.    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here. Sorry we were disrupted in the middle, but we had to go vote.    Dr. Morley, I want to ask you, do you think it is possible to establish episode-based programs while still including long-term care hospitals in the equation?    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. And also for you, Dr. Morley. What ideas do you have for reforming this space outside of bundled payments? Is that the only option or are there others?    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. And Dr. Hammerman, do you believe that bundled paymentsand other types of reforms with the same philosophy have the potential to reduce necessary care, and if so, what steps would you recommend policymakers to mitigate these concerns?    Mr. Guthrie. OK. Well, thank you both for your answers, and thank the panel for their testimony, and I yield back my time.
