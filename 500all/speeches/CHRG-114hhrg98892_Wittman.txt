    Mr. Wittman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I would like to thank our panelists for joining us. You all had mentioned affordability. I want to ask a question in that realm. It seems like where affordability goals have been used, they have been successful. I have a question, though, or a direction in how they are being utilized.    Are they being used across all acquisition programs? Are they being used early in a program's life? Are they managed by someone at a senior level, at a deputy level, who has oversight over all the aspects of the program, requirements, budgeting, program management, acquisition?    So I guess my question is this, is how often does DOD use affordability constraints or goals in the management of a process, and should those affordability goals be inserted at Milestone A, so they can have an effect early on in the process? I would like to get your perspective on that.    Mr. Wittman. Yeah. And let me ask you this. You know, the whole idea of affordability, I think, has to include the concept of value, and if you do that, it has to start in the program writing process to make sure there is continuity there, to the process where you get to a proposal, to the process where you get to program managers, and there is a stovepiping of that that happens right now.    So along the way, affordability might get mentioned or value might get mentioned, but it doesn't continue through the process. That is why, I think the question--Admiral Winnefeld, I would love to have your perspective there since you served at that level. How important is it for senior decision makers at the deputy secretary level to look at the continuity of this, to make sure that if we are going to use affordability as a part of that, that value transfers from stovepipe to stovepipe, from requirements to proposal writing to program management to acquisition?    Mr. Wittman. Very good.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.    The Chairman. Mr. Scott.
