    Mr. Poe. I thank the chairman. I appreciate the words of my friend from California, Mr. Rohrabacher, but I see this completely different. The Russian bear invaded Georgia, gobbled up one-third of the territory, and it is still in Georgia. Still hungry for more land, it went into Crimea, took it, claimed it as its own, and then still on the move, the bear went into eastern Ukraine, where it is now. And we all know that Russia now is in Syria, based on some faulty excuse.    Ukranians have the right to self-determination. This resolution says the Ukranians will decide what their government is going to be, not the Russians. Contrary to what Putin said, the Napoleon of Siberia, Ukraine should decide about Ukraine, not him.    So I think it is a good thing that the United States, a country that believes in self-determination and democracy, support the Ukraine and the Ukranians in their quest for really not just elections, but to be rid of the invaders from Russia. I think we ought to do more for Ukraine than the United States has done. Besides sending them meals ready to eat, we ought to help them defend their own sovereignty against Russia, which is another issue.    This resolution is a good idea. America stands for democracy and self-determination even for Ukranians. So I totally support it, I am glad I am a cosponsor, and I appreciate the chair and ranking member bringing this up before the committee for a vote. I yield back.    Mr. Poe. It would be unpopular. It would be against the law in our State. So we would follow what our law is. We need to let the Ukranians make up their mind what their law is.
