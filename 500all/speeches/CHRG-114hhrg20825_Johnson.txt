    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and gentlemen, thank you for being here with us this morning.    Dr. Volz, how many of the viable U.S. commercial providers for satellite data do you intend to bring under contract in the next three to five years?    Mr. Johnson. How many do you need to bring under? How many do you want to bring under?    Mr. Johnson. Okay. Has NOAA done a cost-benefit analysis of gap mitigation alternatives to determine which ones are likely to be the most effective and worthy of investment?    Mr. Johnson. Why do you not see the need to do the mitigation to look at the most effective?    Mr. Johnson. Sure. As a general aviation pilot myself, I can tell you that the accuracy of that data and the ability to look out and get those accurate forecasts both near term and long term are important.    Have any studies been performed on the cost, benefits and tradeoffs between different potential launch dates for the later satellites such as GOES-U or for JPSS, JPSS-3?    Mr. Johnson. Okay. All right.    Earlier this year, your office hosted a community engagement workshop to inform outside groups and the commercial sector of progress NOAA has made through incorporating commercial technologies, and this week you hosted another such event. What updates occurred between the previous workshop held in April and the one this week? What did you learn?    Mr. Johnson. Okay. Are you talking to individual companies as well to get a broader perspective?    Mr. Johnson. Okay. All right.    Mr. Chairman, yield back.
