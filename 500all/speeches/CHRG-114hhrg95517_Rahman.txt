    Dr. Rahman. I would like to thank Chairman Smith and Mr. Meadows, Ms. Jackson Lee, and other members of the subcommittee, and my representative Congressman Eliot Engel, for giving me this chance to testify.    My name is Dr. Samina Rahman, and I am Abdallah's mother. I am a resident of New York and a citizen of Bangladesh. Today, I will be Abdallah's voice. I will address the human rights violations, crimes, and injustice he and tens of thousands of American children are the silent victims of for decades.    In brief, Abdallah, who is a U.S. citizen by birth, and whose habitual residence is Westchester County, New York, was abducted to India by his own father, Salman Khan, a non-resident Indian citizen, or NRI, who never lived in India prior to seeking a safe haven there in April 2013.    In April 2013, after years of abuse, neglect, and his multiple declarations of divorce, I finally informed my husband that I agreed for divorce. Despite Shariah law, which would grant me sole custody, I promised him shared custody, to be fair to him, to which he responded, ``There is no such thing as shared custody. I will never share my son.''    Later, however, he cried in remorse, and he said he wished to reconcile. I gratefully agreed. A few days later, he announced he was going to Florida to visit his older sister, Arshi Khan. She had ex-communicated me in 2011 after she physically assaulted me and threatened to break my legs and my son's legs and ordered my husband to divorce me and throw me on the street. As a resident training physician, I worked 6 days a week, so I could not have accompanied them to Florida anyway.    Four days later, on the day my son and my ex were expected to return to New York, I received a text message from a United Arab Emirates cell phone number, ``We are in Dubai.'' Two days later, my husband ended all contact with me abruptly. His parents and other siblings, who live only a mile away from my parents' home in the United Arab Emirates, refused to answer my, my parents, and my sister's many phone calls on their many phone numbers. Arshi Khan did not answer any of my calls either.    At a complete loss, I filed a complaint with the Mount Vernon Police Department. They made a phone call to Arshi Khan and asked her if she knew her brother's whereabouts. She said she had no clue. Her lawyer later admitted to the FBI that she had purchased one-way Delta Airlines plane tickets to Dubai for her brother and my son.    However, the very next day, after this call from the police, my husband reestablished contact with me. He claimed I was having an affair and that is why he had to leave me, to protect my son from my immoral ways. He informed me that he had moved to India permanently. I later found out that he had also emailed my employers, my residency program directors, that all my certificates were fake and that I should be fired and deported.    I made many desperate calls at that time, to domestic violence hotlines, the FBI, the NCMEC, the Indian Consulate in New York, the Indian Embassy in Washington, and the United States Department of State. They all advised me to take my matter to family court. My parents then retained a New York lawyer for me, and we petitioned the Westchester County Family Court, since that was my son's habitual residence. However, my ex, despite being duly served, refused to appear in court even via phone, and instead simultaneously initiated custody proceedings in his local district court of Jhansi, India, where he claimed that I was an immoral woman who had abandoned my son and my husband.    My parents then hired a lawyer for me in India on the recommendation of a close friend of theirs in the UAE. My parents, like me, have never lived in India. On the basis of clear death threats, which my husband had made against me and my father, which I had recorded from a Skype video call in May 2013, the Supreme Court of India issued a 3-month stay order on the Jhansi court proceedings, on the district court proceedings.    However, 9 months later, that same Supreme Court of India refused to acknowledge that my son was abducted and ordered that I file a petition for a child custody case in a lower court of the State of Uttar Pradesh, which is a part of the world I have never even visited.    This is in direct contradiction to India's own Constitution. The Guardians and Wards Act of 1890, section 9, clearly states that the court that has the jurisdiction to entertain the application with respect to the guardianship of the minor is the district court of the place where the minor ordinarily resides, which, in my son's case, is the Family Court of Westchester County, New York.    The Supreme Court of India not only asserted jurisdiction over me, a non-Indian who has never lived in India, but also turned a blind eye to the death threats to my father and myself by an Indian citizen and threw out my Westchester Court Family Court order of sole physical custody without a written, unexplained disrespect to the comity of courts.    Am I really expected to hire a lawyer, site unseen, in a country which grants me conditional visit visas of 3 to 6 months at a time? Am I to make that lawyer my power of attorney to represent me in court? Am I expected to wire transfer him tens of thousands of U.S. dollars and then trust in God that he is really making the court appearances he claims he is making?    As a non-Indian who never lived in India, I have no records of tax filing, property ownership, employment, education, or residence in India. So on what basis would an Indian court decide whether I am a fit mother or not?    Tova Haynes-Sengupta from Texas is an American left-behind parent. Like me, she has never lived in India. Her 4-year-old daughter Indira was abducted to India by her ex-husband Susanta Sengupta in December 2013. Due to financial constraints of being a single mother who was a homemaker for the duration of her marriage, and the fact that she is the sole custodial parent of Indira's older brother, she has never been able to, and will never be able to, afford to retain a lawyer in India, nor make trips every 6 months for a court appearance there.    She was awarded sole custody of Indira by the Family Court of Williamson County, Texas, after her ex-husband was found guilty of felony child abuse only months prior to the abduction. There is an unlawful flight to avoid prosecution warrant issued against Susanta Sengupta.    Why are Tova and I being asked to petition the district courts of India for child custody when we have never even lived in India? There are over 30 million cases pending in India's courts today. Ninety percent have been pending for over a year, and over half of them have been pending over 5 years. So why am I being forced to be pending case number 30 million and one?    Since April 2013, I have been allowed to speak to my son only 12 times. Despite the false claims of an Office of Children's Issues welfare report from July 2013, my son is not allowed to call me, and all my calls to him are screened by his father. It has been 27 months since I last looked into my own son's eyes. I breast-fed him exclusively for over 3 years until he outgrew his cow's milk allergy. I taught him to read, write, pray, ride a bike.    My son, my ex, and I lived with my parents for most of my married life. I worked hard on my career as a physician, so that I could provide myself and my son with security and our home someday, since my husband was unemployed, though he is also a medical graduate.    People often ask me, ``How did your ex get your son past five international airports without a notarized consent letter from you?'' So I went online and discovered that while the Customs and Border Patrol recommends such a letter, it does not require such a letter. The U.S.A. has no exit controls for people; only for bottles of shampoo over four ounces.    Americans then ask me, ``Why don't you talk to the State Department and they will bring your child back,'' which could not be further from the truth. Left-behind parents like myself of American children who have been abducted to India have all had the same experience in our responses from the U.S. Department of State's Office of Children's Issues.    In December 2014, 4 months after the Goldman Act was signed into law, I emailed my OCI caseworker to have my son deported back to the U.S.--I thought it was a great idea--because he is an American minor living in India on a fraudulently acquired residence visa, or overseas citizen card, which by Indian law requires the notarized consent of both parents of the minor.    And this is the response I got from my caseworker, and I quote,        ``The Department of State does not have the authority         under U.S. law to inform India that a foreigner is         residing there illegally, or to request their         deportation. I encourage you to consult with your         attorney about the best way to inform the Indian court         and the Ministry of Home Affairs, Foreigners Division,         about Abdallah's legal status in India.''    They continue to write,        ``The Sean and David Goldman Act, ICAPRA, grants the         Department of State the authority to employ a full         range of diplomatic tools to improve cooperation with         India on resolving all cases of international parental         child abduction. We strategically tailor our bilateral         efforts to India's unique legal and political system.         While I cannot share government-to-government         communications concerning the status of bilateral         efforts or procedures, I can assure you that we will         seek opportunities to utilize the tools enumerated in         the new law.''    I was elated to learn that consequent to the Goldman Act there were now bilateral efforts and procedures, and government-to-government communications ongoing between India and the U.S. State Department. Finally, there was hope for parents of children abducted to non-Hague Convention countries.    However, in May 2015, on reading the 2015 annual report, we left-behind parents were devastated to discover that there are still no bilateral procedures in place between India and the U.S., according to the report, whereas section 103 of the Goldman Act clearly states not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this act, which should have been 5 months ago, the Secretary of State shall initiate a process to develop bilateral procedures, including MOU, which include identification of the central authority, which was not done; identification of the judicial and administrative authority that would promptly adjudicate abduction and access cases, which was also not done; and identification of the law enforcement agencies, not done.    We at Bring Our Kids Home are outraged to learn that our children's cases have been open with the State Department for years, but have still not been reported to the Government of India. Three years after Reyansh Parmar was abducted, 2 years after Abdallah Khan and Nikhita Jagtiani were abducted, yet to date the OCI has submitted no application to the Government of India for any of these children.    What prevents the State Department from reporting these cases to the Government of India? Child abduction is a crime in India under Indian Penal Code 361, punishable by up to 7 years in prison. And both the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the National Commission for the Protection of Children's Rights are mandated by the Indian Constitution itself, to uphold the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which India ratified in 1992, which states that India has committed itself to, ``Take measures, including the conclusion of bilateral and multilateral agreements, to combat child abduction and the non-return of children abroad.'' This is referring to Articles 11 and 35 of the UNCRC.    The case of Avinash Kulkarni from California is now 25 years old. His son Soumitra, who was abducted at age 6 months in 1990, is now 25 years old and is completely alienated from his distraught father who says that his life stopped the day his son was abducted 25 years ago.    Twenty-five years later, there is still no bilateral agreement in place between India and the U.S. to address IPCA, which is a crime, an act of child abuse, and a terrible violation of children's rights and parental rights. The numbers in the 2015 annual report by the State Department are inexplicable. Nineteen new abduction cases were reported in calendar year 2014. None were reported to a foreign central authority, yet 22 cases are reported as resolved.    What is probably the most alarming is that although India is listed as non-compliant, the only remedial measure recommended by the State Department is D, encourage India to sign the Hague.    India has a long and well-documented history of treating parental abduction cases as routine custody cases, disregarding custody court orders from jurisdictions where the child was habitually a resident and relitigating those decisions in India for several years and millions of rupees. The only person who consistently wins in India is the abducting parent.    It is no secret that our children are abducted to India precisely because of the legal and cultural environment prevalent in India for decades that provides a safe haven for abductors, where they can about their daily lives as if they never committed a crime.    Abducted children from the United States and from around the world are rarely returned by Indian courts. So why wouldn't the State Department choose to apply the full range of Goldman Act recommendations to address their non-compliance, including (A) training, the State Department promotes training with judicial and administrative authorities on the effective handling of international parental child abduction cases; (B) training with law enforcement entities on how to effectively locate children and enforce court-ordered returns; (F) Department officials intensify engagement with the foreign central authorities for updates on IPCA cases and to promote prompt case processing.    While we left-behind parents live a nightmare every waking moment, what really kills us inside is that we know our children suffer far more than us. They were pulled out of their homes at the most tender age, cruelly deprived of a mother or father's nuture, removed from their family, friends, their pets, their school.    Overnight they find themselves in a new country where they are thrust into a new living situation, a new school, with a foreign language and foreign customs, where they must always be stigmatized and bullied as the Indo-American child whose American parent abandoned them.    They are brainwashed by the abducting parent that they have been abandoned and are already forgotten by the left-behind parent. And they are forced to turn against their left-behind parent in violation of their every natural instinct to love and be loyal to both parents.    My own son was snatched from me at age 6 and is now being cared for by a maid who probably did not attend school, who cannot even communicate with my son. When I last spoke to my son a few months ago, he only knows English. He doesn't know any Hindi.    I am also shocked at how the school that my son was enrolled in, the Delhi Public School, which is one of the best schools of India with several international branches, has enrolled my son without my ex-husband providing a transfer, a school leaving certificate, from Abdallah's elementary school in New York, without providing recent report cards, immunization records, none of that, all of which are typically required by the Board of Education for enrollment of children between grades one and six.    Is it not incumbent on every civilized society to protect its most vulnerable citizens? We at Bring Our Kids Home understand that this is a new era for the strategic partnership between the United States and India. Forward together we go. Chalein Saath Saath.    The two largest democracies of the world have agreed to work together, not only for the benefit of both nations but for the benefit of the world. Together we seek a reliable and enduring friendship.    However, our leaders must never forget Gandhi's words, the seven deadly social sins, including politics without principle, and commerce without morality. Our children need not be considered as sacrifices to the altar of commerce.    A true friend will tell you the truth about yourself and use it to empower you, not to belittle or destroy you. The question is: Does the United States have the courage to make the human rights and security of American children a priority and tell the truth? And does India have the will to lead by actions, not just by words?    Dr. Rahman. I am done.    Dr. Rahman. Thank you.    Dr. Rahman. We at Bring Our Kids Home ask Congress that they continue to press the State Department to change the way they are engaging with left-behind parents and nations that our children are abducted to. There have been good communications, good conversations between India and the State Department, but a year after the Goldman Act there is still no MOU, no treaty, as required by the Goldman Act.    We ask that, though it may be politically unpopular, both Congress and State make clear to offending countries that these abducted American children must be returned to their habitual residence using the full range of diplomatic tools available to them by the Goldman Act.    Thank you.    Dr. Rahman. The communications I have had with the State Department Office of Children's Issues caseworker, usually they will ask me if I have heard anything new, that is about every 6 months. So that is one problem.    The other problem--and then they never sent--formally sent an application for my son. I asked them last week, and 2 days ago I got the email that they never submitted a formal application for my son's return to any Government of India office. They raised his name in May, but there is actually no application, which means he will not be included in next year's report until there is an application for him.    Dr. Rahman. Because India didn't sign the Hague, no foreign central authority has ever been identified for India. That is the reason I got by email. Because India didn't sign the Hague. So there is no foreign central authority.    So, and one thing that disturbed me was that my case, it took me a long time to figure it out, because this whole abduction thing is new to me. So my son, like any Indian citizen, or any American citizen, can live in India on an Indian green card that is called the Overseas Citizen of India Card.    Dr. Rahman. And that needs parental consent from both parents, notarized consent. People with OCI cards, they can come and go into India. There is no need for an exit permit, and they never have to register at a police station or an FRRO office.    It took me 2 years to find that out, and I have to tell my caseworker that. And he thanked me for sharing the information with him. He found it very helpful. So----    Dr. Rahman. For my caseworker, yes, at the State Department, which is unfortunate because I don't know anything about India myself, and I was hoping that they would know something because that is what they deal with. They have an embassy or consulate there.    Dr. Rahman. Might I add something?    Dr. Rahman. Last week I got the email asking me to sign off a privacy waiver thing to allow State Department to inform my Congressman of my case, which is last week.    Dr. Rahman. It should have been done some time ago.
