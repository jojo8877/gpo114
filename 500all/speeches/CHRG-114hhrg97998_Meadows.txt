    Mr. Meadows. Thank you, Madam Chair.    Thank you for your leadership and might I say your consistent voice on this issue. There has never been a day that we can't look to your leadership on this particular issue, and I thank you for that. As the witnesses testify today, I think probably the biggest issue that many of us will be looking toward hearing is, how do we take a system that is perhaps not perfect but also address those issues in a spirit of respect and truly out of appreciation for where Egypt is today?    It would be a mistake to focus so much on the imperfections without acknowledging some of the areas that have been addressed, and specifically Ambassador Tawfik, who is now back in Egypt, was the Ambassador from Egypt to Washington, DC, to the United States, during both government operations, was a personal friend. And one of the things that continued to be mentioned over and over again was how the Egyptian people felt like the United States had abandoned them in that friendship.    So if there is one message, Madam Chairman, that I want to communicate to the Egyptian people today, it is that there are a number of us, not just on Capitol Hill but across the United States, who look forward to an ongoing personal relationship with those in Egypt and that they can count on not only our strategic partnership but our friendship as we work through some of the difficulties that may face us.    I yield back.
