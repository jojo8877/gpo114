    Ms. Moore. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and let me join the chairman and the ranking member in thanking and welcoming this distinguished panel.    It is hard to know who to ask questions of because all of your testimony has been very compelling. But I want to ask a question, and I want to prioritize getting answers from Mr. Ellis, Mr. Woods, and Mr. Heidrick.    And I just want to reference the fact that Ms. Templeton-Jones, in your testimony you talked about the number of insurers that are just leaving the program because of the lapses and so on. So with that in mind, my question relates to a provision that I was able to get into the Biggert-Waters legislation, just a simple study of community-based insurance, and I was just wondering how some of the challenges, I believe it was Mr. Ellis, you mentioned, you laid it out very clearly, the debt, adverse selection, subsidies, the accuracy or lack thereof of the mapping.    How would a community-based flood program fit in with some of the solutions that you all have suggested, giving incentives for cities and States to do mitigation, really bringing more re-insurance and money and private sector dollars into a program, maybe mitigating the adverse selection by having a community-wide effort? I'm just wondering what your thoughts were on that?    Ms. Moore. Okay. Mr. Heidrick?    Ms. Moore. Mr. Woods?    Ms. Moore. You don't think this would help with the cost, some of the challenges that were mentioned, to have a community-wide plan? If I don't particularly live in a flood plain, but I find myself paying 15 cents per thousand dollars of value on my property for a community plan where maybe somebody else pays more because they actually live in a flood plain, just say, New Orleans if I am in the Garden District, but I pay a very small premium to sort of mitigate, as a community plan, you can't see a place for that?    Ms. Moore. Thank you. I yield back.
