    Mr. Shimkus. Thank you. Mr. Wilkins, welcome. It is good to have you back.    Ranking Member Eshoo talked about the 9911 issue, but Commissioner O'Reilly in a blog post said that it is a simple programming change. And the first question--and this is for, obviously, the facility which you are operating out of. Is that your understanding, and did you give him that information as far as the headquarters itself?    Mr. Shimkus. Yes. Yes. I guess I would only say, you may have guessed, obviously, a lot of people who are outsiders come into the----    Mr. Shimkus . FCC to have meetings, you may have bring your kid to work day----    Mr. Shimkus . These are really terrible stories that----    Mr. Shimkus. And really governments should try to lead as much as possible in doing this, and if it is a simple programming then we can tell other entities that, hey, it is a simple programming issue, and it may cost a little bit but the return on investment over time, just for you all leading by example, could be very helpful.    Mr. Shimkus. I would like to then go to a question on, last time we had talked about your--talking about the internal reporting processes for auction-related expenditures----    Mr. Shimkus . And reviewing the use of auction funds and IT. Have you completed this review?    Mr. Shimkus. Can you provide that stuff to us?    Mr. Shimkus. And the other follow-up--and you are providing an audit of these responses and reviews, on the accuracy? Are you----    Mr. Shimkus. And can you provide us some of the ongoing review and----    Mr. Shimkus. And, I am sorry I am going fast. I want to get to the last one. You are also requesting $3 million for the ongoing maintenance, improvement costs for the broadband map. As many of us know on the subcommittee, who have been here for a while, NTIA funded the map through Recovery Act funds or stimulus funds. That is correct. Those funds were exhausted, so last year FCC became responsible for its cost. So we are trying to figure out how that happened. How did we go from NTIA, an agency of the Department of Commerce, now where the FCC kind of took control of this, and then we are trying--the other question is who made that decision?    Mr. Shimkus. But it didn't rise to the level of a, you know, the commission actually making a decision or the chairman saying we are going to do this, was this done just internally kind of by default?    Mr. Shimkus. You got handed the ball and you are----    Mr. Shimkus. OK. Chairman, my time is over. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Wilkins.
