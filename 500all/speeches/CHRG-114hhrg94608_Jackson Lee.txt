    Ms. Jackson Lee. Well, first of all, let me thank you for the courtesies extended by both the chairman and the ranking member. Thank you so very much. Quickly to the witnesses, let me thank you for your testimony. I just briefly will indicate and ask a question, and then hopefully it will go on the record. I am the ranking member on the Crime Subcommittee. We want to make sure that we have some collaboration with the Foreign Affairs Committee for filling in the holes. So my question would be, there seems to be a gap as to dealing with those who are not connected to the United States. We deal with sex trafficking as the buyer, the victim, and maybe in the State. And so my question would be general, and of course to our Congressperson, how do we deal internationally? How do you make sure if there is an international issue in New Jersey that you either connect Federally or that your laws allow you to reach to be able to ensure that their dastardly works are not impacting New Jerseyites, people from Utah, and fill in that gap that we don't miss those who are trying to do devastating things to children.    Lastly, I always mention Boko Haram, way, way, far away, but, you know the dastardly things they have done by kidnapping girls and we believe it has an international effect. So thank you so very much for your service.
