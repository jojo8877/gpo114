    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Congratulations, Mr. Castro, and welcome to this committee.    By making mortgage payments more affordable, FHA's reduction in insurance premiums will greatly help first-time home buyers in high-cost areas such as Brooklyn, where the median home price is $570,000.    Beyond helping creditworthy borrowers access mortgage credit, please describe the economic impact FHA expects the premium reduction to have on high-cost areas.    Ms. Velazquez. What will be some of the economic ripple effects of such action? Will it create jobs? More construction?    Ms. Velazquez. FHA's move to lower interest premiums will help minority and first-time home buyers, for whom the FHA single-family insurance program is a primary source of mortgage credit. To further help these borrowers, FHA has indicated that it plans to increase awareness of its housing counseling programs in Fiscal Year 2016.    How, specifically, does FHA plan to conduct outreach around housing counseling? And do you have any measurable goals being set in respect to this?    Ms. Velazquez. Very good.    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.    As we all know, homes in Hispanic and African-American neighborhoods disproportionately lost value during the recession, and the housing recovery in this area is still lagging.    Beyond the recent reduction in FHA insurance premiums, what additional steps will FHA take to ensure that Hispanic and African-American borrowers are not left behind in the housing recovery?    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
