    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you. And my apologies for being late. I missed some of your testimony. In general, there has been a lot of discussion. And when people meet with me, there is this question of voluntary versus mandatory. And you may have addressed that already in some of your comments, but do you have any thoughts on that?    Mr. Moolenaar. And just, could you speak a little bit about some of your voluntary marketing programs and, again, maybe some of those you have already, but how effective are they?    Mr. Moolenaar. In terms of the compliance with the standard, how does that work?    Mr. Moolenaar. So you have, after conducting an audit, if you find irregularities, do you notify them and then give them an opportunity to comply, or is it immediate loss of status?    Mr. Moolenaar. Well, thank you very much.    And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back.    The gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. McGovern, is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, again, thank you for your testimony, Dr. Morris.    I wonder if you can help me with some of the definitions that you hear a lot. There is genetically engineered, genetically modified. Are those synonymous terms?    Mr. Moolenaar. So it is the means of genetic modification that is the genetic engineering?    Mr. Moolenaar. Some of the modifications occur in nature, do they not?    Mr. Moolenaar. Could you speak to that?    Mr. Moolenaar. And how do you handle that with respect to natural. Because if certain things are being genetically modified naturally, how do you approach that?    Mr. Moolenaar. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.    I yield back.    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back.    The gentleman from Washington, Mr. Newhouse, is recognized for--I haven't figured out how long yet, because he is late--for 5 minutes.
