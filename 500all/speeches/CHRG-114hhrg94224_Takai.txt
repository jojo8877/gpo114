    Mr. Takai. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And welcome, Mr. Secretary.    And nice to see you again, General. I wanted to ask a little bit about what is happening in Hawaii. There has been a lot of talk regarding the drastic reductions in Army troop levels, which I believe actually is contrary to the Defense Strategic Guidance that called for the rebalance or the shift to the Pacific.    So, Mr. Secretary, does the President's fiscal year 2016 budget request provide you with the capabilities and the resources to conduct a rebalance to the Pacific? And how would drastic reductions in this theater affect this capability?    Mr. Takai. Okay, thank you.    And, Mr. Secretary, the other purpose of this hearing is to talk about the President's requests, the AUMF requests, so I wanted to shift gears a little bit and talk about that and ask you to clarify some aspects of the request.    In subsection (c), called ``limitations,'' it says the authority granted in subsection (a) does not authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces in, ``enduring offensive ground combat operations.''    So what is ``enduring offensive ground combat operations''? Does this refer to the length of time in which the operation is ongoing, the scope of the operations, some undefined relationship between time and scope?    Mr. Takai. Okay, thank you, I appreciate that. But maybe if you can, for the record, provide it to us. I mean, I think it is important to define this provision of the request. So if you can provide it in writing, some clarity as to what the President means by ``enduring combat ground offensive operations?'' Thank you.    The Chairman. Thank the gentleman.    Mr. Wittman.
