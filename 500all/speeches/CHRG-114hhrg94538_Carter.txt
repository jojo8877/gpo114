    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Carter. Again, thank you for being here, Ms. Saldana. We appreciate it very much.    It is my understanding that ICE officers and Border Patrol agents are being directed through internal memos not to ask questions concerning why people are here illegally in the United States. Can you tell me what these internal memos say?    Mr. Carter. OK. Let me ask you this and let me remind you you are under oath, and you recognize that. Let me ask you are you directing officers or agents, or anyone, not to follow the law but, instead, to follow the policies of the Administration?    Mr. Carter. So you are not directing your people to follow the policies of the Administration.    Mr. Carter. OK.    Mr. Chairman, at this time I would like to ask to be entered into the record a press release by the National Border Patrol Council dealing with a recent town hall meeting in Miami that President Obama said there would be consequences for Border Patrol agents or ICE officers who do not follow the DACA and DAPA policies and remove qualifying illegal aliens from the United States.    Mr. Carter. In fact, we have a clip of that.    Mr. Carter. Yes, ma'am.    Mr. Carter. We have the clip. Here we go.    Mr. Carter. Can you tell me what these consequences are?    Mr. Carter. Yes, ma'am.    Mr. Carter. But, you know, when you use the word consequences, that is somewhat threatening. I want to know what the consequences are. Can you tell me what those are?    Mr. Carter. But do you consider not doing their job as not following the law or not following the Administration's policy?    Mr. Carter. Policy is just as critical as law?    Mr. Carter. But what about when policy doesn't agree with what the law is, when it is in direct conflict of what the law is?    Mr. Carter. OK, a minute ago you spoke about the memos that you have sent out. Can we get copies of them?    Mr. Carter. Now, I am not talking about just the one. I want to see the internal memos that you have sent out to Border Patrol agents and to ICE officers.    Mr. Carter. I understand. What about ICE?    Mr. Carter. Can we get those?    Mr. Carter. OK. One last question. Are you familiar, are you aware of any other director involved in this process who has sent out directives to ICE officers, Border Patrol offices, or anyone else, not to follow the law, but, instead, to follow the policy of the Administration?    Mr. Carter. OK. Thank you very much.    I yield back my time.
