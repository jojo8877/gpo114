    Mr. Meadows. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. McCarthy, good to see you again.    Mr. Meadows. I want you, if you would, to clear up something for me. Chairman Bishop, when he asked you about why you did not notify the Fish and Wildlife, your testimony was that you did not anticipate a discharge, so there was no notification.    Then, upon further questioning from Mr. Fleming about an unrelated, you said that a discharge was imminent, that you believed that it was going to happen.    So, which is it, your testimony to Mr. Bishop or your testimony to Mr. Fleming? Because they seem to conflict.    Mr. Meadows. All right. Let me go a little bit further then, because any time you do any kind of work, there is a plan.    Mr. Meadows. Who approved the plan? EPA? Don't you approve the plans?    Mr. Meadows. Well, I am troubled, because I looked at that video, and I am very familiar with 402 permits. I have been there, done that.    Mr. Meadows. It does not even seem like you followed your own guidelines that would be applied to the private sector. I did not see any of those there. Did you intentionally avoid your own guidelines?    Mr. Meadows. Did you follow 402 general guidelines?    Mr. Meadows. Now, I did not ask--I said 402 guidelines. That is a specific question.    Mr. Meadows. So, where was the retention--where was all----    Mr. Meadows. So the retention pond was behind the truck?    Mr. Meadows. Because I saw the video. It started flowing to the truck.    Mr. Meadows. Where is the retention pond?    Mr. Meadows. Yes, but, Ms. McCarthy, listen. You are talking to somebody who has done this. Normally what you have are multiple retention ponds, in case of a blowout. I know that I have had to construct them. So, you anticipate worst-case scenarios. It does not look like you anticipated worst-case scenarios. It looked like you kind of cut some corners to try to get it done, and you had a truck there working on it.    Mr. Meadows. What is your opinion on that? Was it adequate? Your opinion. I am not asking----    Mr. Meadows. Was it adequate?    Mr. Meadows. That it was not adequate.    Mr. Meadows. OK. So let me----    Mr. Meadows . Finish----    Mr. Meadows. OK. Why do we have to look at the Department of the Interior? You keep coming back to that as this independent----    Mr. Meadows . Agency.    Mr. Meadows. Well, it is part of the Administration, so I hardly see the DOI being independent, necessarily, the way that we would think of independent. So why not the Inspector General?    Mr. Meadows. But why would they not have----    Mr. Meadows. Why would they not have the main authority, the Inspector General for the EPA?    Mr. Meadows. Why would they not have the main authority?    Mr. Meadows. So who decided who is going to inspect who? Did you decide who is going to be independent?    Mr. Meadows. But your agency decided who was going to be independent?    Mr. Meadows. Can you get those documents to the committee, in terms of those inquiries that were made, in terms of who would be best? Because, obviously, if you made multiple inquiries, you have data and emails to back that up.    Mr. Meadows. I would ask that you----    Mr. Meadows. If you would, get that to the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    The Chairman. Thank you. Under 5 minutes. Well done.    Mr. Lamborn.
