    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for holding this important hearing.    Mr. Garcia, if I may, what is being done by the public and private sectors to advertise the importance of cybersecurity to the small business community? Also, what cost-effective steps can they take to protect themselves and their customers?    Ms. Velazquez. Are you aware of any coordination with the Small Business Administration?    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.    Mr. Nichols, the nature of the U.S. card market presents unique challenges as we move forward with EMB implementation. As you know, many of the 28 million small businesses in the United States now accept card transactions, and switching over to card reader technology will be costly. Is there anything being done to help mitigate the costs and also to inform the small business community of the risk of not upgrading?    Ms. Velazquez. The new technology.    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.    Mr. Bentsen, we all know that Federal spending to combat cybersecurity continues to grow at an extremely rapid rate. How do we tap the unique talents of small technology firms in an effort to strengthen our national cybersecurity defenses, especially in the financial sector?
