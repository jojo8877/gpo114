    Mr. Castro. Thank you, chairman. And thank each of the witnesses for your testimony today.    I want to pick up where the congressman left off, Mr. Hochberg. Can you describe some of the infrastructure for financing that foreign countries use that are comparable to EXIM? What are we competing against basically?    Mr. Castro. What are the European governments or the Asian governments doing for their businesses?    Mr. Castro. Sure. I come from Texas as the chairman does, and Texas does more trade than any other state in the nation. So this is obviously a very big deal for us. We have companies, big and small, but some like Boeing and Caterpillar who have a significant presence around San Antonio who benefit from EXIM. But I would ask all of you what is at stake for us for a state like Texas if your services go away?    Mr. Castro. Sure. And then I will just make one last remark in my last 15 seconds. I support the reauthorization of EXIM and support the work that you all are doing. I think every agency in the U.S. Government deserves a thorough vetting and quite frankly to be improved probably, but you are running in the black. You are doing a great service for American companies and I hope that this Congress can find a way to preserve the services that you are providing. I yield back, Chairman.
