    Dr. Hice. Yes, sir.    The Chairman. Mr. Hice, you are recognized.    Dr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this very important hearing that we are having.    Mr. Weiss, I agree with my colleague that the way out of this, obviously, is growth. Puerto Rico has at times sought to become a party to various U.S. income tax treaties, and yet the Treasury Department has turned down these efforts. Given the dire circumstances, would you support or do you favor a change in policy in this regard?    Dr. Hice. I understand that. But my question is, would you support a change in policy?    Dr. Hice. All right. You are going far beyond yes/no answers with this. It was a relatively simple question.    It is becoming clear to me and to many others that the emerging consensus around Congress is that there should probably be a control board, much less consensus regarding Federal bankruptcy protection.    You may or may not be familiar. Do you know whether or not the District of Columbia got Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection 20 years ago?    Dr. Hice. Again, that is not my question. Did they get bankruptcy protection?    Dr. Hice. That is true. Do you believe a control board of some sort could be effective in reorganizing Puerto Rico's finances without filing Chapter 9 bankruptcy?    Dr. Hice. It does.    Dr. Hice. Let's go on, you are taking my time. The question was do you believe a control board would be helpful, and you have still not answered that question. Yes or no?    Dr. Hice. OK. Let's shift gears a little bit. You talk about restructuring. Before any restructuring takes place, wouldn't it be good to have some real numbers, such as something that would come from an audit of the finances, which has not taken place now in quite some time?    Dr. Hice. Mr. Weiss, you ramble a lot. These are not complicated questions. Can we expect an audit? Yes or no.    Dr. Hice. OK. What kind of progress is being made on that? At what point can we expect an audit?    Dr. Hice. Time has expired. I would appreciate more yes/no answers, direct answers, but I yield back. Thank you, sir.    The Chairman. Ms. Bordallo.
