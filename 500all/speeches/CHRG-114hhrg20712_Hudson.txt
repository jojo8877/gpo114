    Mr. Hudson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the panel for being here.    Dr. Pillai, the NIH office that had the smallpox boxes was reassigned to the FDA in 1972. Why didn't the FDA do any sort of inventory over the room when it was transferred to control at that point or at any time from 1972 to 2014.    It seems to me that one simple inventory, something that businesses back in my district do every year, would have caught this mistake.    Mr. Hudson. Has that been changed now?    Mr. Hudson. Appreciate that answer. When we asked FDA why it failed to utilize proper inventory controls in the cold storage room we were told that this room is apparently not subject to inventory controls since there was no accountable Government property inside the cold storage room.    Accountable Government property is a term that's defined as all computers and pieces of equipment with a value of more than $5,000. But how could FDA know there's no accountable Government property if they hadn't done an inventory?    Mr. Hudson. So your opinion now--any kind of critical reagent programs, they have a value of some $500 to $1,000 apiece. I mean, would, in your opinion, they now be considered this Government property that needs to be inventoried? I mean, has there been a change of mind set in terms of--instead of just making $5,000 and up we need to have an inventory of everything?    Mr. Hudson. So just to clarify, so going forward, vials of biological pathogens are no longer not considered important enough to be inventoried or as an accountable Government property there's no discrepancy now?    Is that what you're telling me in terms of having a dollar amount? If it's a pathogen, it's going to be inventoried?    Mr. Hudson. OK. Thank you for that.    Mr. Chairman, I see I'm running out of time. I'll go ahead and yield back.
