    Mr. Rokita. I thank the chairman for the hearing. I thank the witnesses for their time. I want to first go to Mr. Robinson just to see if he wants to continue with his answer that Mr. Jeffries questioned him about, if you have any more to add to that. Time ran out.    Mr. Rokita. Excellent point, Mr. Robinson. That goes to one of my other questions. In fact, we are concerned about accountability as Mrs. Fudge stated, and that is true, but as to these public school choice programs--private school choice programs, like in Milwaukee, is it not true there is scrutiny there. There are reports made. When you look at those, that scrutiny, relative to what the traditional public school scrutiny is, is it not accurate that these programs do get more scrutiny?    Mr. Rokita. I have one more line of questioning for you. Your testimony focused a lot on research. Dr. Huerta's testimony focused on that, too. As the Ranking Member stated, the data somehow is saying that on average, public school choice is just average. Do you want to comment on that?    Mr. Rokita. Excellent. Ms. Merriweather, do you agree with what has been said by Mr. Robinson?    Mr. Rokita. Thank you. In the time I have remaining, sticking with you, Ms. Merriweather, what do you think about the allegation, the comment, the opinion that these programs simply take money from low performing schools, from poor neighborhoods, and move it to more effluent neighborhoods?    Is that valid?    Mr. Rokita. Thank you, Ms. Merriweather. Mr. Chairman, it seems that what Ms. Merriweather is saying is we need universal school choice for every student.
