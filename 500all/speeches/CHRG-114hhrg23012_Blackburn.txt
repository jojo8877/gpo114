    Mrs. Blackburn. That is exactly right, we are going to have to run to the floor. But I do want to welcome you all.    And as the chairman has said and the ranking member has said, we have been here before on this issue. July 16th, 2014, we had a hearing on this issue. I have visited the CDC to look at processes and procedures, and it is such a concern to us. Even in your own report you have found what is at the core of this problem. The lack of approval, the lack of written instructions, there is not a best practices process in place.    So the GAO, we are delighted to have you here and want to talk with you about three of your findings--the tracking, the gaps, scientific gaps that exist, and then the Federal Select Agent Program and the inconsistencies there. So we thank you so much for being here. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your attention to the issue.
