    Mr. Royce. Thank you, Chairman Neugebauer. I appreciate that.    Mr. Bentsen, it is good to see you, and the rest of the panel members there--Mr. Garcia.    I guess, as we get down to the nitty-gritty of how we get to where we need to go, you mentioned earlier the concept of having these different sectors work together. You all work with a number of Federal agencies or--including with the financial regulators, you work and have some knowledge of their expertise, since I think we even have a representative on the NCCIC (N-kick) watch floor.    So the question would be, for better coordination or harmonization, to get there somebody, in my opinion, has to be in charge. Somebody has to take the lead on it, and I don't think that has been asked yet. Maybe, Mr. Bentsen, you could start. Who should be in charge--Treasury, OCC, Homeland, DOD? How do you set this up? Because at the end of the day, unless somebody is in charge, bringing everybody together, it is awfully hard to make it work.    Mr. Royce. The second question I would ask--I understand your concept there and where the decision-making--where the focus should be in the Executive Branch, but I still think you probably have to give most of the key decision-making to the entity that has access to the most information and understands it the best.    But in your testimony you also talked about the need to increase the pool of educated cybersecurity personnel. There are a lot of universities now involved in this sphere, including Cal Poly Pomona, which is in my district. But I am wondering what the industry is doing to address this particular workforce shortage in this area of expertise. Are you working with higher education institutions in order to churn out people?    I can tell you, on the other side, Moscow clearly is working hard and educating teams on the other side of this equation. Now they have that special bureau from North Korea that is out there educating right now in terms of how to hack into the South Korean banking system. So if we are going to do some good defense work, it is good to work through the university system as well in order to offset what is probably coming.    Mr. Royce. I am going to go back to Mr. Garcia and Mr. Healey's points. The concept of being allowed to hack back under strict controls, maybe being deputized by an accredited law enforcement agency, if that can be put together, is it a general consensus that it might be workable in terms of counter-battery work against those who are attacking these systems, any exception to that, or do you think it just might work?    Mr. Royce. Right.    Mr. Royce. You are not legally allowed--    Mr. Royce. --to go on offense and you are saying they would be allowed to go on offense.    Mr. Royce. Yes, yes. Okay.    Mr. Chairman, thank you.
