    Mr. Sires. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you for being here today.    Congressman Wexler, nice to see you. I see the passion is still there, which is great.    You know, I keep thinking about this money that is paid out. I cannot imagine that the donor countries who are trying to help make these payments cannot help, cannot be--what is the word I want here? What I am trying to say is, will the will be in those countries to stop payment? Is there a will to do that? Or will they just keep running along with the program? Can anybody answer that?    I mean, I would think it would be very easy, if the will was there, to say, well, we are not going to give you any money if you are going to pay for these people who--the families of people who commit atrocities. Why isn't the will there to stop that? It seems to me, anyway. Maybe I am wrong.    Mr. Sires. But I am talking about European countries giving money, and people are committing atrocities. They get the money, Abbas gets the money and doles it out. But I think it should come from the people who give the money to Abbas who have the will and say, hey, we are not going to give you a dime if you keep using the money for this.    I mean, there is no will there. And then yet, you know, they are the first ones who criticize Israel all the time.    Mr. Sires. Well, that----    Mr. Sires. We have to start somewhere.    Dr. Pollock?    Mr. Sires. I am more concerned about the European countries.    Mr. Sires. Because we put stipulations in the money that we give.    Mr. Sires. Yeah. I do not think that one issue is going to solve everything. It is much more complex than that.
