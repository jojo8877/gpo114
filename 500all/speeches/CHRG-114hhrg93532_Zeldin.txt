    Mr. Zeldin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, there was a letter that was sent from the President to Congress with the Authorization for the Use of Force. If I could just read a couple of sentences from that letter: The authorization I propose would provide the flexibility to conduct ground combat operations in other more limited circumstances, such as rescue operations involving U.S. or coalition personnel or the use of Special Operations Forces to take military action against ISIL leadership. It would also authorize the use of U.S. forces in situations where ground combat operations are not expected or intended, such as intelligence collection and sharing, missions to enable kinetic strikes, or the provision of operational planning and other forms of advice and assistance to partner forces.    So this is a letter from the President, four or five paragraphs that accompanied the request for the Authorization for the Use of Force.    When Congressman Grayson was asking whether or not the authorization was providing authorization for offensive operations, you had indicated no. Obviously, for several months, we have been utilizing strikes from the air, which, you know, one could argue are offensive in nature. So I am just looking for a little bit more clarity on what, specifically from an offensive end, the President is looking to do to defeat ISIS; what is the limit of his authority under this authorization?
