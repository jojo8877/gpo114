    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Brundage, thanks largely to the oil and gas industry, coupled with programs like Shale NET that is in our state there at State College, unemployment in shale counties in my district in Eastern and Southeastern Ohio has fallen 66 percent since 2010. In fact, these shale counties are the economic impacts, the positive economic impacts. So the shale plays--that is what is driving the unemployment rate down for our entire state.    And because of this, we have got to continually look for opportunities like Shale NET to prepare our students for the jobs that are here today and that are coming tomorrow.    Quick question. If the goal of Shale NET is to increase capacity in terms of qualified workforce to meet the needs of the industry, how successful in your view has Shale NET been? Can you give us some specifics?    Mr. Johnson. Great. Well, I appreciate that. I am going to be respectful, Mr. Chairman, and yield back the remainder of my time.
