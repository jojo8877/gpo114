    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Judge Poe, for your leadership on what is so important, the attacks in Paris.    And, indeed, this is bipartisan. I am grateful to work with Congressman Keating as cochair of the French Caucus. And it is personal to me. I am of French heritage and very grateful for that. And we appreciate and have great sympathy for America's first ally, France.    The Parisian attacks came just 1 day after the President claimed that ISIL was contained, further showing that his policy, I believe, to protect American families is a legacy of failure.    What we have, sadly, ISIL, Daesh, is an ability to effectively coordinate mass murders of civilians across the world. We must never forget 9/11. It is clear that defeating ISIL will require a much more coordinated effort comprised of a broad coalition of America and its allies in Europe and the Middle East. I look forward to the recommendations of the distinguished panel here today and the insights on how we might counter ISIL's strategy to commit atrocities worldwide.    Thank you.
