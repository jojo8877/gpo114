    Mr. Royce. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will just take a moment here and thank you for your years of advocacy on this issue. It is good to see Ambassador Jacobs here, and I hope, really, that this hearing will help improve the reporting that this new law requires from her office. And, in particular, accurate data on unresolved abduction cases is essential to enabling American parents and judges to make informed decisions about whether to allow children to travel to particular countries in order to avoid new abduction cases.    I also want to welcome all of our left-behind parent witnesses, including Kelly Rutherford, whose case I have raised previously with the State Department. We cannot help but feel the trauma that all of you endure while separated from your daughters and your sons. And, Kelly, all of us here are so pleased that you have been reunited with your children for the summer. We continue to hope for a permanent resolution for your family.    Before yielding back, I also would like to submit for the record a written statement by Sarah Kurtz, a resident of Los Angeles, who is enduring a painful separation from her two children who are currently in Sweden.    And I am grateful to the subcommittee, again, but also to the State Department, and our brave witnesses, for coming together today to shine a very personal light on these very tragic separations which must be mended.    Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Royce. Well, what is amazing is 1,000 new cases a year. It demands our action. So thank you, Chairman.
