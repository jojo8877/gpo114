    Mr. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Gentlemen, one of the things that we are being asked to do is to repeal the 2002 authorization for the use of military force. As you know, the 2002 AUMF with--concerning Iraq found that Iraq poses a continuing threat to the national security of the United States and international peace and security in the Persian Gulf region, and because members of Al Qaeda are known to be in Iraq.    I would like your opinion, because it would seem to me that even though the Saddam Hussein regime has been removed from power, that the objectives in the 2002 resolution remain: protecting both United States and Iraqi minority groups as well as ending terrorism in Iraq. All of those objectives are still in doubt, and therefore it does seem that there may be a compelling legal rationale for keeping the 2002 AUMF in force since the President obviously is finding that he has very broad authority under it currently.    So do you believe that leaving the 2002 AUMF concerning Iraq in place would be a conflict, and would you recommend removing the text that repeals the 2002 AUMF? Any thoughts?    Mr. Turner. Other thoughts? Any other thoughts on the panel?    Mr. Turner. Excellent. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Thank you.    Mr. O'Rourke.
