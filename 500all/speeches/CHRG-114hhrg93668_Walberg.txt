    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the panel. Your report noted that there was a common critique that you heard, that the service was too insular. What are the areas of greatest concern in which the agency needs to improve?    Mr. Walberg. Who are the main individuals or groups that are bringing these concerns to you? Were these coming from agents on the line?    Mr. Walberg. You noted hearing that Secret Service would send low-level representatives with little authority to interagency meetings and that they were, in your words, hamstrung from deriving benefits from their participation. Who at the Service was responsible for this practice? And I guess the other question is why?    Mr. Walberg. And that is a problem with insularity then?    Mr. Walberg. Didn't want to branch out and find anything different than what was normal?    Mr. Walberg. How far down the chain of command does this extend, that attitude extend?    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
