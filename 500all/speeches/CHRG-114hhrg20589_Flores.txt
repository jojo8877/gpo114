    Mr. Flores. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to talk about the impact of the conflicting regulations that have been proposed by the EPA on State resources. I will start with you, Mr. Sadredin.    You testified that your local air district is subject to four standards for ozone and four standards for fine particulate matter and that each standard, quote, requires a separate attainment plan which leads to multiple overlapping requirements and deadlines, unquote.    And so how does your agency harmonize all of these overlapping requirements?    Mr. Flores. So what you have to deal with now requires significant staff and resources and you've got--so you are spending all this time and resources on these conflicting plans and are we getting any corresponding health benefits out of this?    Mr. Flores. Right. Right. The prior questioner talked about rolling back--that the bill rolls back several regulations. Does it--Mr.--Dr. Shaw, does it roll back any regulations?    Mr. Flores. Back to the same question that I asked Mr. Sadredin--sorry, I am messing your name up--what is the impact of the multiple--the conflicting standards on your resources?    Mr. Flores. Mr. Cabrera, any comments from you on the multiple standards that exist today?    Mr. Flores. OK. And Mr. Matheson, would you like to comment on the conflicting standards?    Mr. Flores. OK. And there was some commentary that going to a 5-year review period--going to a 10-year review period from a 5-year review period causes great harm.    I look at the rollout of various standards over the years. There was 8 years between the first two--I mean, from '71 to '79 before you changed standards.    Then there was 18 years between '79 and '97, and then there was 9 years. So in all this time our environment situation has gotten better.    So it doesn't sound to me like the world ended because we weren't adhering to a 5-year standard. Do any of you all disagree with that? OK. Thank you. I yield back.
