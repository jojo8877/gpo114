    Mr. Mica. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Let me ask, first, a general question. It appears that there is a fairly significant increase. The information I have is just since 2014 a 15 percent increase in incidents of some of the security risks or incidences. Is that correct, Mr. Scott? So we are seeing a fairly significant increase? Maybe each one of you could tell me what we are seeing overall or what you anticipate we are facing. Is this something that was just the last year or are we now expecting this to continue to increase?    Mr. Mica. But this is fairly accurate, the 15 percent increase just in 2014?    Mr. Mica. Security incidents?    Mr. Mica. Ms. Seymour, are you seeing the same thing?    Mr. Mica. You have more activity. So you expect more incidents.    Mr. Wilshusen?    Mr. Mica. And that is up?    Mr. Mica. And Ms. Seymour just said that some of it is because we are shifting from paper to computer and cloud and a whole host of other things.    Mr. Mica. It is going up.    Mr. Mica. And that is going to be the second part of my question, where the risk comes from. You are a little bit ahead of me.    Dr. Fischer, you are also seeing the increase and the basis for the increase. Some they mentioned is that there is more activity, going again to the computer base----    Mr. Mica. Continued increase.    Okay, the other thing, too, is the risk, where is the risk coming from. Some risk is State-based. You know, these incidents are being initiated by other States, rogue or whatever, and then rogue, say, individuals who can penetrate the system. Where is the risk coming from that you all see? Let's just go down the line real quick. Mr. Scott?    Mr. Mica. Is that most of it?    Mr. Mica. And then most of the risk that we should fear, is it from that, or should it be from rogue operators?    Mr. Mica. Again, what poses the biggest risk, the State or the rogue?    Mr. Mica. National security and economy.    Mr. Mica. And the other thing, too, is we are seeing more of the contracts for some of these services go to the private sector, as opposed to in-house Government. Does that pose more of a risk? And are we putting in place means to require that they have in place protections that are adequate when they contract this work out?    Mr. Mica. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
