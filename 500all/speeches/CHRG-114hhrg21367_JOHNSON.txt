    Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you for testifying today. We appreciate that.    I am just going to be frank with you. You know, back in Collin County, Texas, people do not like Obamacare, and as a result of the law, they have seen their insurance premiums and costs increase and their access to doctors and other providers decrease, all the while having to pay higher taxes to pay for Obamacare.    Now, we do not have a CO-OP in Texas, but the recent failing of the 11 CO-OPs is still important to my constituents. The reason why is because over $1 billion in taxpayer money has gone down the drain, and that is what happens when almost half of the Obamacare CO-OPs have failed.    Dr. Cohen, it seems with so much taxpayer funding on the line, CMS should have been more proactive to ensure the solvency of these CO-OPs. In fact, Vermont refused to allow a CO-OP to set up shop because of unrealistic assumptions on rates, enrollment and other key factors.    So these CO-OP failures ought not to have been a surprise. My question for you is: when did CMS become aware that the CO-OPs were failing, and why did you not do more to protect taxpayer dollars?    Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, but when did you figure out that they were not going to make it?    Mr. JOHNSON. It seems like you just want more dollars. Well, I think the taxpayer just deserves more.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. JOHNSON . Without objection.    Mr. JOHNSON. Without objection.    Mr. JOHNSON. Without objection.
