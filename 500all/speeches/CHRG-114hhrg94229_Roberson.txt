    Ms. Roberson. Thank you, Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Cooper, and other members of the subcommittee. I am the Vice Chairman of the Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board, and I would like to acknowledge the other two members sitting directly behind me, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Santos.    Last year's radioactive release at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant demonstrated the significant impact likely to result from a radiological incident at any DOE defense nuclear facility. Waste disposal operations have already been shut down for over 13 months. This has impacted cleanup activities across DOE's entire defense nuclear complex, and illustrates that even activities judged to be relatively low risk can still have major safety consequences and large impacts on DOE's ability to accomplish its mission when radioactive materials are involved.    The board is the only agency that provides independent safety oversight of DOE's defense nuclear facilities. The board's budget is devoted to maintaining and supporting an expert staff of engineers and scientists, nearly all of whom have advanced technical degrees, to support us in accomplishing our highly specialized work.    The President's budget request for fiscal year 2016 includes $29.15 million in new budget authority for the board. It will support a planned staff of 125 personnel. This level of staffing is needed to provide sufficient independent safety oversight of DOE's defense nuclear complex, given the pace and scope of DOE's activities.    The board provides safety oversight of a multitude of operations critical to national defense. These operations include assembly and disassembly of nuclear weapons, fabrication of plutonium pits and weapons components, production and recycling of tritium, nuclear criticality experiments, sub-critical experiments, and a host of activities to address the radioactive legacy resulting from 70 years of nuclear weapons operations.    The board supports and closely oversees DOE and NNSA's efforts to develop new defense nuclear facilities that integrate safety into their design at the very earliest stages. The delays in NNSA's programs to modernize its uranium and plutonium capabilities require the board to provide continued safety oversight of ongoing defense programs work, and aging nuclear facilities that do not meet modern safety standards.    Given the age and condition of many of DOE's defense nuclear facilities, the board is placing particular emphasis on emergency preparedness and accident response capabilities across the complex.    Let me add in closing that the board and DOE together have built a constructive working relationship. All board members, myself, Mr. Sullivan, and Mr. Santos, understand that a safe nuclear security enterprise is our priority.    That concludes my statement. Thank you.    Ms. Roberson. Yes, sir, Mr. Cooper. We are providing oversight to the project, and we too have looked at--I mean, we are just over 100 people, so we tend to prioritize, but we have placed additional emphasis on our oversight investment for this project.    Ms. Roberson. Yes, sir.    Ms. Roberson. Mr. Chairman, the consequences are, as I stated in my opening statement, the questionable reliability of safety controls and the health of your safety management programs. So we have really been focusing our oversight, both for NNSA and EM, because EM also has aging facilities too, really focusing on the reliability of their safety controls, the health of their safety management programs, criticality safety, radiological safety, fire protection, and also on emergency management, which, at the end of the day, must really be healthy to ensure you can respond to anything before it becomes something more than a small incident.    Ms. Roberson. Well, we think that newer facilities that meet modern safety standards would be important, I think the board's been consistent in saying that in the recent years. We also think that Environmental Management should continue to get out of facilities that are decrepit, you know, undo them before they undo themselves. And so I think the board has been consistent in staying supportive of NNSA's efforts to, you know, establish, whether it is big box or modular, whatever they choose, but to establish infrastructure for the workers and to ensure protection of the public that meet modern safety standards.    Ms. Roberson. I don't know if we have provided them a prioritized list. We certainly give them lists. We have the opportunity to discuss the things that we are seeing that we think are a high priority from a safety perspective on a routine basis.    Ms. Roberson. 1) The DNFSB (Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board) identified concerns with specific requirements in the Department of Energy's (DOE) emergency management directive as well as the implementation of the requirements at various DOE sites with defense nuclear facilities. Based on these concerns, the DNFSB believes that DOE has not comprehensively and consistently demonstrated its ability to adequately protect workers and the public in the event of an emergency. These concerns focus on DOE's role as a regulator.    2) The DNFSB identified the following specific deficiencies that we believe DOE needs to address:    a. Standardize and improve the DOE criteria and review approach to confirm that all sites with defense nuclear facilities:    <bullet>  Have a robust emergency response infrastructure that is survivable, habitable, and maintained to function during emergencies, including severe events that can impact multiple facilities and potentially overwhelm emergency response resources.    <bullet>  Have a training and drill program that ensures that emergency response personnel are fully competent in accordance with the expectations delineated in DOE's directive and associated guidance.    <bullet>  Are conducting exercises that fully demonstrate their emergency response is capable of responding to scenarios that challenge existing capability, including response during severe events.    <bullet>  Are identifying deficiencies with emergency preparedness and response, conducting causal analysis, developing and implementing effective corrective actions to address these deficiencies, and evaluating the effectiveness of the corrective actions.    <bullet>  Have an effective Readiness Assurance Program consistent with DOE's requirements.    b. Update its emergency management directive (DOE Order 151.1C, Comprehensive Emergency Management System) to address:    <bullet>  Severe events, including requirements that address hazards assessments and exercises, and ``beyond design basis'' operational and natural phenomena events.    <bullet>  Reliability and habitability of emergency response facilities and support equipment.    <bullet>  Criteria for training and drills, including requirements that address facility conduct of operations drill programs and the interface with emergency response organization team drills.    <bullet>  Criteria for exercises to ensure that they are an adequate demonstration of proficiency.    <bullet>  Vulnerabilities identified during independent assessments.    We received DOE's Implementation Plan for this Recommendation on April 24, 2015. Our staff is reviewing the Implementation Plan to determine the adequacy of DOE's proposed activities to address the deficiencies identified in the Recommendation. The staff was engaged with their DOE counterparts during the development of the plan and provided comments. During the execution of the Implementation Plan, the Board's staff will work closely with DOE to provide appropriate actionable suggestions regarding implementation of activities in the plan.    The technical supporting document for Recommendation 2014-1 identified examples of deficiencies with site-level emergency preparedness and response. These include:    ``Some sites do not have a 5-year plan for exercises that involves all of the hazards and accidents at their facilities with EPHAs . In addition, some sites do not exercise all of their facilities with EPHAs and all of their response elements on an annual basis.'' DOE Order 151.1C requires sites to demonstrate response capabilities by executing emergency exercises. In order to meet this requirement, sites such as Pantex and Sandia National Laboratories should be executing a variety of exercises to demonstrate response capability to the spectrum of possible hazards at each facility, as well as providing adequate training and drills to develop and maintain this capability.    ``Planning and implementing recovery actions are typically not demonstrated in detail during the normal scope of annual emergency exercises at DOE sites , or in follow-on exercises.'' DOE Order 151.1C also requires sites to demonstrate recovery capability. The ability to conduct initial recovery actions, including how to map a transition from emergency to recovery to normal operations, should be practiced frequently enough that site leadership can effectively conduct this activity when real-life operational emergencies occur.    ``. . . any of the emergency response facilities may not be habitable in the aftermath of a hazardous or radiological material release event, or survivable in the aftermath of a severe natural phenomena event. These facilities were not designed to survive an earthquake, and many do not have ventilation systems that will filter radiological and toxicological materials. Examples of such facilities include the Emergency Control Center (ECC), the Technical Support Center (TSC), and the fire house at Y-12; the EOC at the Hanford Site; the EOC and alternate EOC, the Department Operations Centers, and the Emergency Communications Center at LLNL ; and the EOC and Central Monitoring Room at WIPP .'' DOE Order 151.1C does not include explicit requirements concerning emergency facility habitability; other agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, do provide such requirements. The DNFSB Recommendation identifies the need to update the directive to address this gap. ``Members of the Board's staff also observed problems with systems used to support emergency communications and notifications. For example, the staff observed problems with the systems used to notify workers and visitors about an emergency and protective actions that are to be taken, such as was observed recently at WIPP during the underground truck fire.'' DOE Order 151.1C provides requirements for emergency notification systems at DOE sites, including notification to the site workers and off-site notification to the public. However, guidance to implement this requirement is deficient. Sites must develop clear criteria for when to continue operations when notification systems are degraded or failed, including compensatory measures that are tested and effective to ensure workers receive notification that an operational emergency is occurring and the necessary protective actions to take. Robust, survivable, and tested notification systems installed in and around facilities at sites such as the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, the Savannah River Site, the Hanford Site, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are a necessary first step to address this concern.    Ms. Roberson. The DNFSB has prepared an informal action plan to address the recommendations and corrective actions within the LMI study. For example, all DNFSB executives and Board Members are working with an executive coach to develop better communication techniques and enhance leadership effectiveness. Regular staff meetings are being held at both the agency and office level to provide increased opportunities for employee feedback and participation. The full action plan for organizational culture change is attached.    In addition, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Office of the Inspector General (OIG) recently completed a Culture Climate Survey of the DNFSB staff. The response rate exceeded 70%, and the OIG will be briefing the results to the DNFSB management and staff on May 21st. I anticipate additional actions will be planned as a result of that additional feedback.    Ms. Roberson. The DNFSB has evaluated deferred maintenance documentation and databases during site-specific maintenance reviews and generally found the management of safety risk to be acceptable. (NNSA's list of deferred maintenance is housed in the Department of Energy's Facilities Information Management System .) The majority of the deferred maintenance had a relatively low impact on nuclear safety and was being worked as resource availability permitted. The management and operating contractors at each site commonly make it a high priority to minimize deferred preventive maintenance of safety class and safety significant structures, systems, and components (SSC) that are credited to perform safety-related functions in the Documented Safety Analyses for nuclear facilities. The DNFSB will continue to review maintenance programs at NNSA sites, including assessments of deferred maintenance, to ensure SSCs critical to preserving the safety of nuclear operations are appropriately managed.    It should be noted, however, that the overall NNSA deferred maintenance backlog of $3.6B includes many non-defense nuclear facilities and associated infrastructure exceeding 60 years of service that have little or no bearing on the safety of nuclear operations. Many of the items in NNSA's deferred maintenance database are roofs, office air conditioning systems, shop utilities, and the like. At some sites these types of deferred maintenance vastly surpass corrective maintenance backlogs or deferred preventive maintenance on nuclear safety-related SSCs and processing equipment. Nevertheless, infrastructure risk in a non-defense nuclear facility can pose a nuclear safety risk under the right circumstances. For example, a major fire in a non-defense nuclear facility could threaten a nearby defense nuclear facility. In such a case, we would expect the credited fire suppression systems in the defense nuclear facility to provide for the adequate protection of the public and workers from radiological consequences. Clearly, though, it would be preferable to avoid a major fire in the first place.    To help prevent degradation of the nuclear facility safety posture, equipment owners or system engineers at the sites are typically expected to provide technical input during the decision process for deferring maintenance of safety SSCs. For example, if preventive maintenance activities for safety SSCs will exceed defined schedules, it is necessary to obtain a deferral evaluation and approval or make a determination of compensatory measures to be implemented.    DOE Order 430.1B, Real Property Asset Management, requires DOE/NNSA sites to annually use condition assessment data to determine and report the deferred maintenance information in FIMS. The site contractor must maintain FIMS data and records, which are DOE's corporate real property inventory database for all buildings and other structures and facilities. Although, it is expected to be difficult to evaluate comparative risk among the NNSA sites, the DNFSB has requested FIMS database information relevant to deferred maintenance at defense nuclear facilities. In addition to reviewing the FIMS data in an attempt to identify any potential safety risks related to deferred maintenance, the DNFSB will continue to execute site-specific maintenance reviews. Any safety concerns related to the prioritization of deferred maintenance will be brought to the attention of responsible NNSA management.    The Board's response to Question 21 provides additional details on deferred maintenance.    Ms. Roberson. The DNFSB agrees that infrastructure risk can become safety risk. It should be noted, however, that the overall NNSA deferred maintenance backlog of $3.6B includes non-defense nuclear facilities and infrastructure that have little or no bearing on the safety of nuclear operations. Many of the items in NNSA's deferred maintenance database are roofs, office air conditioning systems, shop utilities, and the like. At some sites these types of deferred maintenance vastly exceed corrective maintenance backlogs or deferred preventive maintenance on nuclear safety-related structures, systems, and components (SSC) and processing equipment. Nevertheless, infrastructure risk in a non-defense nuclear facility can pose a nuclear safety risk under the right circumstances. For example, a major fire in a non-defense nuclear facility could threaten a nearby defense nuclear facility. In such a case, we would expect the credited fire suppression systems in the defense nuclear facility to provide for the adequate protection of the public and workers from radiological consequences. Clearly, though, it would be preferable to avoid a major fire in the first place.    Safe performance of work includes allotting adequate resources to system and equipment maintenance, maintaining up-to-date configuration control, and making necessary upgrades to support system infrastructure. A lesson learned from the recent Waste Isolation Pilot Plant events is that degraded and out of service safety-related equipment must not be accepted and tolerated. Deficient and poorly maintained safety-related infrastructure, including credited safety SSCs that support nuclear activities, can pose safety risks to the public and workers, and can jeopardize NNSA's ability to accomplish mission-related work.    Infrastructure is defined in DOE Order 430.1B, Real Property Asset Management, as ``All real property, installed equipment, and related real property that is not solely supporting a single program mission at a multi-program site or that is not programmatic real property at a single program site.'' DOE Order 430.1B defines deferred maintenance as ``maintenance that was not performed when it should have been or was scheduled to be and which, therefore, is put off or delayed for a future period.'' Maintenance activities are expected to be scheduled and performed within established intervals; preventive maintenance should be waived or deferred only with approval by an appropriate authority that considers the significance of the SSC and the length of delay. Further, any deferral of planned tasks should have a technical basis.    The number and severity of risks increases when the amount of deferred preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance backlog rises. Each nuclear facility has a Documented Safety Analysis (DSA) and accompanying Technical Safety Requirements which set forth the preventive maintenance and surveillance requirements for the safety class and safety significant SSCs credited by the DSA to prevent or mitigate hazardous accident scenarios. The implementation of these maintenance and surveillance requirements is key to ensuring the SSCs will reliably perform their credited safety functions on an on-going basis. As such, completion of the maintenance and surveillance requirements is carefully controlled or, if not achievable, compensatory measures are implemented or the associated operations are shut down until the required maintenance or surveillance is complete.    Deferred maintenance associated with safety-related SSCs credited in DSAs is of paramount concern to the Board. Maintenance on other safety-related programmatic and infrastructure equipment is also important to maintaining the safety envelope of defense nuclear facilities. Preventive and corrective maintenance should only be deferred if sufficient technical justification exists to do so.    The DNFSB has identified preventive maintenance deferrals at NNSA/DOE sites whose justifications were less than adequate. For example, preventive maintenance has been deferred because parts were not ordered, or because materials or craft resources to support the work were not available. Similarly, the DNFSB has seen cases where preventive maintenance schedules were modified based on business decisions. The maintenance deferral process must ensure adequate reviews are carried out to understand the possible impact of not performing a maintenance task on schedule, applicable compensatory measures are instituted to manage those risks, and understanding and acceptance of any added risks are documented.                                 ______
