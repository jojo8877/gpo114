    Mr. Barton. That's whoop. I am an Aggie.    I just want to welcome Dr. Shaw. Sorry I missed the earlier meeting but you've testified here before and we look forward to hearing what you have to say and, of course, all the other witnesses, and thank the chairman and ranking member for the hearing.    Mr. Barton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I am going to ask most of my questions to Chairman Shaw, but if anybody wants to answer them, they can. I just know him a little bit better.    What was the original ozone standard set back in 1971?    Mr. Barton. It was over 100.    Mr. Barton. But it was set in a different way on a 1-hour.    Mr. Barton. We've changed it to an 8-hour.    Mr. Barton. And has consistently gone lower every time it's been set. Isn't that correct?    Mr. Barton. How low can it go? I mean, why not just put into law every 5 years we are going to reduce it 5 parts per billion and be done with all this? Because that is what happens, basically.    Mr. Barton. Well, now, the standard is parts per billion. Isn't that right?    Mr. Barton. And we are going from 75 parts per billion to 70. So we are changing it five parts per billion. Can I tell the difference? If I breathe air right now, can I tell the difference between 70 parts per billion and 75 parts per billion?    Mr. Barton. I tried to exercise for 6 and a half hours, that would kill me. That would be a measurable impact on my health.    Mr. Barton. What is the sensitivity of the best air quality monitors--in other words, the variance--they measure parts per billion plus or minus--it used to be about 10 parts per billion, but it may be better now.    Mr. Barton. Let me ask Mr. Cabrera a question.    What do you do in these rural counties like you mentioned where the natural occurring ozone is probably higher than the standard? You just--there is nothing you can do. What--I mean----    Mr. Barton. Thank you.
