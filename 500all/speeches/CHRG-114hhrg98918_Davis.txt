    Mr. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to all the witnesses for being here today. I would like to start with Mr. Rogers. As the CFTC pushes to develop these standards to report each and every swap trade, are precautions being taken to ensure that such rules don't end up hurting liquidity? Because reporting actually imposes real costs on the market participants.    Mr. Davis. Okay. Ms. Kruse, does industry feel the regulators are only demanding the information they need or expanding into new fields?    Mr. Davis. Okay. Now we know every SDR is going to need to make some changes to comply with this uniform reporting standard. Are you concerned that the regulators won't give industry enough time to implement some of these changes with the fields that you have mentioned? Ms. Kruse, go ahead.    Mr. Davis. Okay. Well, I guess for the other two witnesses, do you have any comments on any of the questions I have asked?    Mr. Davis. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Gil?    Mr. Davis. And not Mr. Rogers?    Mr. Davis. Okay.    Mr. Davis. Right. Well, thank you all very, very much. Mr. Rogers?    Mr. Davis. If the Chairman allows me extra time, you can.    The Chairman. Absolutely.    Mr. Davis. Thank you.    Mr. Davis. I think from some of the questions we have asked, I respect the fact that the CFTC is willing to take those ideas into consideration. We would urge that to happen, and we appreciate your willingness to work with us. And thank you all for being here, and I don't have any time to yield back.    The Chairman. Mr. Kelly?
