    Mr. Ratcliffe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I very much appreciate you holding this hearing on the issue of security in our airports. As you know, I am a former terrorism prosecutor, a United States attorney that served after 9/11 and, you know, very much believe in the mission of the TSA and believe--and I am grateful for the testimony of the witnesses today to inform the opinions of this subcommittee.    I am also, I will say, someone that goes through our airports through the TSA PreCheck program and so you know, I am very familiar with that.    Based on the testimony that I was able to review, the one thing that I am concerned about, is some of the TSA's more flexible programs that allow for real-time assessments of potential risks as opposed to the TSA PreCheck, which allows travellers like me who qualify and submit to a background check to get through more expeditiously. I know, Mr. Roth, you commented on that in your March 16 report and talked about the incident involving a convicted felon who was improperly cleared under one of these more flexible programs.    So, I guess let me just start there. I want to ask this question of you, Mr. Fletcher is, you know, why is the TSA using methods like Managed Inclusion and risk assessment to expedite the TSA PreCheck line when individuals who opted in the PreCheck program go through a more rigorous procedure to gain the benefits of the program, what it offers?    Mr. Ratcliffe. Thank you, Mr. Fletcher. I see that my time is expired, so I would love to ask a question of the Inspector General, but I will yield back.
