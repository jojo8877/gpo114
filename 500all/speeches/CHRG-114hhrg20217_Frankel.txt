    Ms. Frankel. Thank you. And thank you to the witnesses. I know sometimes you probably sit in here thinking that Congress may do a better job at criticizing than fixing. Thank you for your patience and your courtesy. Also, I live near a subway and I rode the Metro. I used to love to ride the Metro. But they've, obviously these stories in the newspapers and on TV have been scary to me. So my first question is, could you quantify, has it been a decline in the ridership, and does that affect your budget? And the other question I have is also, with these very highly publicized criminal incidences, there was a young man that was stabbed multiple times. There was a woman that was recently sexually assaulted. And I don't mean to insinuate that that was the fault of Metro. What my question would be, is there anything that you can do to make it safer, or are you doing to make it safer, for the riders?    Ms. Frankel. One more question. I see you got an award from one of my colleagues for firing. I think a better award would be for training. What are you doing about training so you don't have to fire?    Ms. Frankel. Well, but what are you doing to up the training?    Ms. Frankel. Are you--excuse me, are you holding classes, or what are you doing?    Ms. Frankel. This is required. Required, employees are required to go through the training?    Ms. Frankel. What about continuing?    Ms. Frankel. OK. Thank you very much. I yield back.
