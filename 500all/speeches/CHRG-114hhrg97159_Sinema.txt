    Ms. Sinema. Thank you, Chairman Neugebauer and Ranking Member Clay, for holding this very important and timely hearing.    As you may know, Congressman Mulvaney and I are sponsors of bipartisan legislation to bring greater transparency to the National Credit Union Administration's budget process by requiring a public hearing on the budget before adoption. This legislation is simple and straightforward. It would require NCUA to publish a draft budget on an annual basis and then hold a public hearing with notice and opportunity for public comment before the NCUA Board makes a final determination on how funds are spent.    As NCUA is funded almost exclusively through fees assessed on credit unions, we believe the public and the credit unions that are regulated should have an opportunity to weigh in as NCUA considers its annual budget.    Between 2001 and 2008, NCUA held public hearings. I look forward to hearing from today's witness about why these hearings have been discontinued and how the agency can improve the current budget process to make it more open and transparent.    Again, thank you, Chairman Neugebauer and Ranking Member Clay for holding today's hearing.    And thank you, Chair Matz, for sharing your expert view with us today.
