    Mr. Olson. I thank the Chair, and welcome Chairman Wheeler and Commissioner Pai. Since I have been on the Energy and Commerce Committee, since 2011, consumer privacy has been a focus of my work for the people of Texas 22. In the 112th and 111th Congress, that work was done on the Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade Subcommittee because they had jurisdiction over the FTC. But the FCC has grabbed that authority to regulate the broadband ISPs, taken it from the FTC, and now it is with the FCC, and now it is under this Committee's jurisdiction.    The good news is you haven't lost me. I am still with you. But folks back home want to know why. What was the problem with the FTC and broadband ISPs that forced this change? And a matter of time, would you--Chairman Wheeler 1 minute, and you, Mr. Pai, 1 minute to respond to his comments. Chairman Wheeler, why was it changed----    Mr. Olson. OK, great. That gave me some time back. Mr. Pai, you response, Mr. Pai.    Mr. Olson. I have no idea.    Mr. Olson. And so you believe it is important that the FTC has expertise to handle these issues, as opposed to the FCC, correct?    Mr. Olson. OK. And the Chairman talked aboutanother issue, about privacy and edge providers. Chairman Wheeler, a consumer interest group filed a petition asking you to start a rulemaking to oppose consumer privacy protections on edge providers. When are we going to see your response? Do you believe that edge providers should have a different standard protection than ISPs?    Mr. Olson. OK, thank you. Commissioner Pai, your response?    Mr. Olson. Well, thank you both. I yield back the balance of my time.
