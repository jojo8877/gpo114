    Mr. Barr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this important hearing to explore and learn more about the dangerous nexus between terrorism and criminal organizations.    I am particularly interested in whether or not there is substantial evidence of U.S.-based criminal organizations that have partnered with Islamic terrorist organizations. And what is the extent of the nexus between--we have heard about international drug cartels' involvement in partnerships with terror organizations. But to what extent are American-based, U.S.-based criminal organizations affiliated with Islamic terrorist organizations like Hezbollah? Like ISIL? Anyone?    Mr. Barr. Let me turn to ISIL for just a minute.    We know from your testimony and from previous hearings that the sources of ISIL funds are predominantly in oil and the looting of the banks from Mosul and kidnappings and ransom and the like.    To what extent does the Islamic State have access to and participate in the international financial system? And what could American policymakers do to disrupt the Islamic State's access to financial institutions?    Mr. Barr. So is Section 311 the best tool available to the United States to disrupt those banking activities?    Mr. Barr. My time is about ready to expire.    But if any of you could just offer an opinion on what is the single most important policy change that this Congress could enact that would disrupt terrorists' access to criminal organizations. Is there any one recommendation that you would highlight?    Mr. Barr. Thank you.    I yield back.
