    Mr. Washburn. Thank you, Chairman, Ranking Member, former Chairman, Mr. Cole, and other members. I want to thank you for your support.           Assistant Secretary Indian Affairs Opening Remarks    I have to begin by thanking you really seriously. In recent years, this committee, on many issues, has been out in front of the Administration on leadership and support for Indian Country, and the roughly 8,000 employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Indian Education and my own staff thank you for your support of our work. It has meant a lot to us and it has meant a lot to everyone in Indian Country.    I want to tell you, this year the President's request matches your own leadership in Indian Country. The President's budget request totals $2.9 billion for Indian Affairs programs. That is $323.5 million more than the current enacted level. I thank you for your past support and hope that you will continue your strong bipartisan support for Indian Country.    You and I know that many of the programs, in fact a majority of the programs, are actually run by tribes out in Indian Country. About 68 percent of this budget will effectively go directly to tribes so they can run our programs because they do a lot better running our programs than we do in many respects.    Our Federal appropriations have sometimes run on a time principle which is slow. It is what some of my friends in Indian Country have started calling Federal time. We are often late in doing our jobs, and let me own a lot of that on our end because after the money gets apportioned to us, we are sometimes slow getting it out the door. My Deputy Assistant Secretary, Tommy Thompson, is working really hard so we can get the money out faster. Part of that is on Congress, though. This year we did not get a fiscal year budget until the middle of December. When that happens, when we have a continuing resolution and then we get a budget, we have to do everything twice, and sometimes three times. It really helps us if you will have a budget, even if is not everything you want, ready to go October 1 and we do it once because that makes life a lot easier for all those people who have to push money out every time there is a change in the budget. So I encourage you and urge you to try to help us get a budget out once. It will be good for Indian Country.    Let me give you some good news about this year's request. And I would like to help this subcommittee out of that tight spot that you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, when you gave your opening remarks. The President's budget supports a real all-of-government approach to Indian Country and so I want to talk first about what is not in the Indian Affairs budget. Let me tell you how this came about. Indian country is proposed to get a lot of new funding that helps us but it is in other parts of the Federal budget.    President Obama set up a White House Native American Affairs Council and appointed Sally Jewell as the Chair of that council. One of the first things she did was to say to OMB we need to be breaking down silos in the Federal government. One of the best places we can do that is with budgeting. So for the first time in history, this year as we prepared our budget, OMB brought multiple agencies together and started talking about the President's priorities in Indian Country and asked how can we all work together to meet them. For example, one of the things we got out of that and something that helps my budget very much, or helps the problems I am trying to address very much, is funding for teacher housing. There is $10 million in the HUD budget for teacher housing in the President's proposal which will not come to this subcommittee but nevertheless will help us meet these goals.    Some of you were at the State of the Union address. I think I saw you on TV. One of the things the President's request for community colleges does is support tribal colleges. The President has asked Congress to provide for tuition for 2 years for community colleges which will include tribal colleges, so that is a huge boost for tribal colleges. That funding comes out of--well, Mr. Cole, I am sorry to put that on you but I think that comes out of your subcommittee's budget. But we are trying to spread this around. We are trying to take care of these priorities by looking beyond just the Indian Affairs budget.    One other big avenue in that respect is the Department of Education. Arne Duncan is proposing to change some eligibility rules for their early childhood education programs. It used to be that only states could apply for the money in those programs, and he is changing those eligibility rules so tribes can apply for those programs too, and you all know how important early childhood education is. I know you personally know that. So tribes will have more access to that kind of funding so it is not just in our early childhood development program line but there will also be Department of Education money.    Those are all things that are not in our budget but are nevertheless very, very helpful. The funding requests are not in your specific committee assignments with the exception of Tom over there. We put a lot on his plate.    Our budget request for the Bureau of Indian Education, which is really our highest priority this year, would increase our budget to about a billion dollars. A lot of this is for school construction but it is for a lot of other things as well. We are working diligently to make the Bureau of Indian Education more effective. The Secretary more than a year ago started an education study group and made me the Chair. Mr. Roessel has been on that group as have several other people including one formerly from the Department of Defense which recently upgraded their schools and someone from the Department of Education. We have a really good team working on how we can improve education. There are a lot of increases in the BIE budget proposal but we are also trying to clean up the house at the Bureau of Indian Education so it works better. I will not go through line by line but there is a huge increase requested to support a better performing BIE, to ensure that we can spend funding properly, and make things better for Indians on the ground.    I think you all know the importance of contract support costs so let me just quickly mention the Appropriations Committees' report language which alluded to mandatory funding for contract support costs. We are working with our authorizing committees to try to get that off of the Appropriations Committees' plate and into a different pot so that it makes it easier for tribes to count on that funding. I know that is a big lift. I know it needs your support. I know it is not in your portfolio but it needs your support.    We have a bunch of specific things in the budget that are very, very important. For example, the budget includes a $4.5 million increase to establish an Indian Energy Service Center. We have heard for a long time that we need to help tribes with permitting which cuts across several Interior agency lines, and so that $4.5 million request is really important to support not just us but also the Bureau of Land Management and other agencies that have so much work to do in Indian Country.    I do not want to go on and on and on and filibuster this thing so I am going to stop here. I have Director Mike Black and Director Monty Roessel with me, and I will be asking them to help me answer your questions because we want to make sure you get good answers today. Thank you.    Mr. Washburn. Okay, Mr. Chairman. I could answer that question in about 3 hours, but what I have done is----    Mr. Washburn. Fair enough. That is a big part of the problem, frankly. We have given you this 2\1/2\ inch budget justification that hopefully is more than a doorstop. There is an org chart in this book that partially answers that question. The problem with fully answering that question is that Indian Affairs is really evolving right now because we have published a blueprint for Indian education that will change these things dramatically, and hopefully align accountability a little bit more clearly with powers and responsibilities in Indian Country.    So we are working really hard on that. On a weekly basis we have been having big meetings of our team that is trying to implement the blueprint. There are a lot of subcommittees to that team too. I think some of those changes are going to require reprogramming requests coming over to the committee. It is difficult to change anything in the Federal government. It takes a lot of ``mother, may I's'' and many people can veto it, so it has been, I have to say, one of the most challenging things I have ever seen in my life trying to get this done. We are trying to realign the Bureau of Indian Education, the roles and responsibilities there, as well as within the BIA to be more supportive of education. It has been really challenging but it is very much an evolving process right now.    Mr. Washburn. Mr. Chairman, yes, a little bit, and you raised that with us, and we have been looking into it. We talked to the folks at the Department of Defense that assisted with that. You know, they did a big makeover of their schools to the tune of, I believe in excess of $1 billion and perhaps in excess of $2 billion. They looked at some similar financing arrangements. When we talked to the person on our staff who worked on the reconstruction of defense schools, she said, there are 17 different reasons why alternative financing models do not work. We are still looking at it, and we have raised it with OMB as well. We do want to be creative here, but we have a different problem than what state schools have because we do not have a tax base for floating bonds and that sort of thing. We want to commend you for your creative thinking around these things and we need to be doing creative thinking too. So if you keep putting those things on our plates, we will keep considering them.    Mr. Washburn. They are, Chairman. On the Defense side, they largely ponied up the money to do it and they did it over multiple years. That is kind of what we have in mind, that it is probably a 5- to 6- to 7-year plan for reconstructing our worst schools, and then we definitely need more attention to maintaining those schools, the preventive maintenance-type stuff.    Mr. Washburn. Yes, ma'am, it is, and it would also allow us to plan for those schools that will be on the next priority list so that we can be out of the gates with construction for the next fiscal year.    Mr. Washburn. Well, the criteria was developed according to a negotiated rulemaking that we were required to do by Congress. We had a team put together a formula. The team was representative of members from Indian Country including Director Roessel in a former job. The formula was developed by a committee in all the best ways because it is widely representative.    We are currently trying to make sure we have got good data to plug into that formula, and actually we are making great progress there. We certainly intend to have that list out this year. We probably will have it out this summer. I hate to make promises about anything that is not entirely within my control but we are working diligently to try to get that list out.    I am responsible for holding that up because I did not want to put a new list out until we had made a commitment to all the schools that were on the 2004 list and got that done because I thought that that was really important before we start developing new expectations.    Mr. Washburn. Well, let me say this, and I am going to ask Director Roessel to address the Johnson-O'Malley question, but let me talk more broadly about the census question.    Tribes don't fully trust the process that the Census Bureau uses. I think that the Census Bureau is the expert on these things and we have to work with the Census Bureau but we----    Mr. Washburn. Well, that is interesting, and we need to talk to them more about that. We have to work with Census because they truly are the experts. You all require us to be experts in nearly everything under the sun in Indian Country. Consequently, we do nothing well in Indian Country. If you ask us to be an expert in everything, we cannot be, and we will do nothing well if we are spread too thin. This is one of our great frustrations, and so we have to work with other experts in the Federal government like the Census.    Let me turn it over to Director Roessel to talk about the JOM count.    Mr. Washburn. Well, Mr. Chairman, you are absolutely right. It is a real challenge. I want to thank you for all the support of IHS for the last few years because that has made a real difference in Indian Country. We need to make the same kind of difference in Indian education for sure, but we just do not have the resources to be fully holistic on everything we need to do.    We need to focus on poor schools, but we also need to be a lot more strategic, and so one of the things we have added to our budget this year is a new line. We have always had the school construction line which we have never funded nearly enough, but it looks at whole campuses. We have added a line for facility construction. So for example, take the Bug School. The elementary school is actually fairly nice. The high school is deplorable, but we average out that school and consider what the condition of the campus is. We need to have the ability to be more strategic and go in and surgically improve buildings. When there is one bad building that is really bad, we need to be able to do that.    We have over 1,700 school buildings and it is overwhelming. It is really overwhelming. But we have to be strategic. We do think it is a multiyear plan. If you gave us a billion dollars for next year to address all the backlog, we would not be able to spend it responsibly. We do not have the infrastructure to do that. And you know, we have to develop that infrastructure, and I think the GAO has pointed out well the things that we need to do. We know what we need to do. So we will not ask for you money that we cannot responsibly spend, but we do need to have a serious focus on this over the next 5 years, at least, and probably more like 6 or 7.    Mr. Washburn. We are doing that, and we are actually even using private detention facilities to some degree too because it is cost-effective. Let me say, if you look back over the last 10 years, we have rebuilt about 40 schools, and a lot of that was with ARRA money. DOJ and BIA have built about that many detention centers. Do you want to be building detention centers or do you want to be building schools? That is the issue that we face directly, and that is a challenge because you do need detention centers. You saw the one at Hopi. That one needs to be, replaced. However, how cynical do you want to be? Do you want to build schools or detention centers? Do you want to add anything to that, Director Black?    Mr. Washburn. Thank you, and we actually are working directly on that. We have put Directors Black and Roessel together to work on those issues, so we now have the BIE working much more closely with our juvenile detention centers.    Mr. Washburn. Congressman Kilmer, I am going to ask Director Black to address your question because that is entirely within the BIA, but thank you for the question.    Mr. Washburn. Well, thank you, Congressman. That is a big part of our budget request. My budget is about $2.9 billion this year, and the entire crosscut across the federal government for Indian Country is about $20.8 billion. The programs that I have for Indian Country are about 14 percent of the programs for Indian Country by dollar volume. So what we have learned is that we do not need to be all in a bunch of different silos. So at least for tribes, we need to have one place where they can come and we can be the omnibus. We can make sure tribes know about all the programs.    And I think you are exactly right. I think an online portal needs to be part of the solution but it cannot be the only solution. Tribes need human beings to help them navigate these things. So we need both of those things as a part of the system.    It is going to be enormously challenging, not just because of these digital divide problems but the digital divide problem has plagued us in many areas and so a lot of our schools do not have good access. The Macaw Tribe in the State of Washington has had challenges and we have helped them modestly with funding. We have been looking for funding from the FCC and their E-rate program. We have been getting help from Verizon for computers and online services within schools. We have been turning over every rock we can because we do have to solve the digital divide problem. Thank you.    Mr. Washburn. Mr. Chairman, absolutely. We have been noting so many places in Federal programs that tribes just are not able to participate in. Some programs serve states or other governments or other groups, so lots of places just need to make sure tribes are eligible to apply as well. We would be delighted to help you with that.    Mr. Washburn. We have three tribes that have taken on pilot programs, but come the middle of March or so, every tribe in the country that wants to do it can start doing VAWA prosecutions in theory. They have to put a lot of things in place to do that, so we think that will go slowly at first because it is quite expensive at the tribal level. We have funding this year in our fiscal year 2015 budget, a million dollars, to help train tribal courts so they can handle this so they can, exercise this responsibility. So we are conducting a lot of training to try to make sure that tribal courts have the resources they need to put that into place properly.    Mr. Washburn. I am going to ask Director Roessel to handle your question because he is in the weeds on these kinds of questions. Keep in mind that he has 1,700-plus school buildings and 183 different campuses that he is in charge of as well.    The quick answer is, we plan for construction, and we had plans, and if we want to change plans, there is a lengthy process to change those plans. Want to move quickly too. It is hard to change the plans when that ball has started to roll. But I am going to ask Director Roessel to address your question in more specificity.    Mr. Washburn. Thank you, Chairman. We have been accused of putting you on a bus that has square wheels. We have been accused of putting you on a box that had no shocks. And that is one of our serious problems and it is a problem all over Indian Country, especially on large, rural reservations, and frankly, Mr. Black and I have gotten an earful about the formula for funding roads, and that is a formula developed in Congress, not by us, and so we know those are serious concerns.    Since Director Black is an engineer, I think I will ask him to answer this question. But let me just say, we have $26.7 million in our proposed budget for road maintenance. There is a whole other bill that affects this area. I think it is called the Grow AMERICA bill, the reauthorization to MAP-21 is an area where there is significant money for roads and so we do not want to take all of it on ourselves because there are other committees and other agencies with important responsibilities, and we do spend some of that money that comes from that bill but we need to be taking an all-government approach to this as well. Mr. Black.    Mr. Washburn. Well----    Mr. Washburn. There is no perfect formula out there. That is right.    Mr. Washburn. Good. Can we leave it there, leave it with your optimistic statement?    We actually have been working on this, and there were two houses. We have tried to arm-wrestle with our law enforcement folks to get those houses and perhaps make them available to teachers. They have said no, we want to keep them and we will fill them. You may recall there was an issue about the cost of those homes. We are trying to do some creative work to figure out how to get the costs down so that law enforcement officers can use those homes. We have one rented, and we are working on a solution for the other one.    You know, the local community had a lot to say about that. They wanted police officers in those homes and so--    Mr. Washburn. You and us too.    Mr. Washburn. Well, that is a question, and I think it is the GSA that is involved.    Mr. Washburn. And honestly, everybody has got some responsibility. There are some Congressional formulas that we have to follow too--but that is a good question, and we are trying to figure out a way to make those spaces more affordable for those folks, and we are making some progress.
