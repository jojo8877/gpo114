    Mr. Hudson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here with us today.    The original Advanced Research Projects Agency within DOE has been in existence for a few years now. Part of the mission of the program is to, quote, ``accelerate transformational energy technologies from concept to market,'' end quote.    Has anything come to market yet since the program's inception 6 years ago? For example, has there been any wide-scale deployment of commercialized product that has resulted from the ARPA-E program?    Mr. Hudson. Well, that is encouraging to hear.    What metrics does DOE use to evaluate the success of these projects?    Mr. Hudson. Well, when an ARPA-E funded project isn't resulting in progress or benefits, are there any protocols in place for ending that project?    Mr. Hudson. Switching gears a little bit, you mentioned the first Quadrennial Energy Review. Can you tell me how much that first review cost?    Mr. Hudson. Well, if you could get back to me with maybe more----    Mr. Hudson. OK. I appreciate that.    But assuming the costs are generally what you are saying, would you say it has been valuable based on that cost?    Mr. Hudson. OK.    And you have said the second installment of QER will conduct a competence review of the Nation's electricity system. What was the agency's motivation for focusing solely on electricity for the second QER?    Mr. Hudson. Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I see I am out of time. And I will submit written questions to follow up on, just sort of what the timeframe for participation and when we expect that QER draft to come forward.    Mr. Hudson. Great.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
