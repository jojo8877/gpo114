    Ms. Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you so much, gentlemen. I wish I would have been here at the beginning. I found this to be so informative. Really appreciate all you bring to this discussion.    You mentioned, Mr. Secretary, the Littoral Combat Ship. I am interested in talking a little bit more about that. Since I have sat down, you have said that the frigate, you don't want to have the LCS and the different roles it can play, you think the frigate would be a better ship for some purposes. You have also said that a ship can't be all things for all possibilities. If I have quoted you wrong, please correct me.    How do you see the LCS, its current role, what it is expected to do? Can it meet those challenges? And, Admiral, you as well. I think the current budget from the President has decreased the number of LCSes that we are going to be purchasing. Do we need to maintain the number or even increase them? And just how do you see this fitting into our Navy operations today? Thank you.
