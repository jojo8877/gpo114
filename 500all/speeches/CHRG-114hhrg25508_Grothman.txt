    Mr. Grothman. Thank you.    In the past, the committee heard numerous accounts of line staff being punished for minor infractions while high-level managers went unpunished for significant abuses. Is there a double standard if a TSO employee can be fired for picking up a pen during integrity tests but senior officials who retaliate against their subordinates or engaged in serious misconduct such as lying to the police about a DUI are allowed to keep their job?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Next, this is more of a comment, and I want you to respond because I think Congresswoman Maloney said something I don't agree with. I obviously on this job fly a couple times a week. I have never seen a situation in which the pre-check line is longer than the regular line, and I think I can probably speak on behalf of most people. I wish you would put more people in the pre-check line because we would get things through quicker. And I do hear people complain, and I realize you have got a difficult job, but they wish they could go through the lines faster. So I don't know, you know, who she talks to, but just so you know there is another side to the story.    And I have got another question for you. TSA spent $47,000 on an app to randomly assign people to go right or left that anybody with basic knowledge of codes could do. Do you feel that app is worth what TSA paid for it?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Mark Livingston, the former deputy assistant administrator, testified that a watch floor transformation that was supposed to cost $3-3.5 million cost approximately $12 million because it was performed improperly. Do you want to comment on that? Are you familiar with that?    Mr. Grothman. We will give you one more thing that Mr. Livingston said. He said there is a still a half-million dollars worth of equipment sitting in a box in the office. Do you want to comment on that? Are you familiar with that?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. I will yield the remainder of my time.
