    Mr. Grothman. Thank you much.    Chairman Taub, one of the objectives of the current system and any new system that comes out of the rate review is to make sure we have high-quality service standards. And right now, there is some indication that we are struggling in that regard. If the Postal Service continues to have problems in that area, what action do you think the Commission will take?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. I have a question for Ms. Brennan here. You know, we talked a lot about how the volume of mail has dropped over the last 10 years from 213 billion to 154 billion. And we use 2006 as the base year. But do you know what it was like 10 years before or 20 years before that?    Mr. Grothman. Was it going up? I mean, the point I am trying to make is it ----    Mr. Grothman. So it might have been 154 billion in 1986 or 1990? Two thousand and six was the high point in terms of total volume in the system.    Mr. Grothman. So what I am getting at here is I wonder if you are creating kind of an artificial cause for a problem by grabbing the higher at 213 and say we are at 154 so of course we are going to have a crisis? Maybe we were at 154 in 1980 and you weren't having a problem. You know what I am saying?    Mr. Grothman. But you don't know the answer?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. One of the biggest capital investments you have--and we had a hearing on this before--is replacing the aging vehicles. What is the current status of that situation?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Last time you guys were in here on this topic you said you were going to buy 120,000 vehicles. Is that still the plan?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. So you are going to try to spread it out maybe ----    Mr. Grothman. Pardon?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. So if I get a job--and I know you have got to work part-time in the first place. If I get a job as--I don't know that you start out as a mailman or not, but what do I expect starting as far as my pay?    Mr. Grothman. How about a career employee?    Mr. Grothman. Twenty-five dollars an hour, plus--do those people get overtime? Do you have overtime?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. And is that common?    Mr. Grothman. What's your average mailman make right now?    Mr. Grothman. Yes.    Mr. Grothman. Okay. My time is up. I will yield the remainder of my time.
