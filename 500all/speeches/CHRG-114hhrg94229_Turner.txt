    Mr. Turner. The President's budget request clearly supports Uranium enrichment technology. In your opinion, do you find that maintaining the American Centrifuge capability is important?    General Klotz. A reliable supply of enriched uranium is required to meet U.S. national security requirements. Any enrichment technology used to meet these requirements, should the interagency determine that such technology is the best way forward, must be U.S. origin. Enriched uranium provided via foreign technology, even if located in the U.S., may not be used for national security purposes due to international peaceful-use assurances. The President's budget request maintains the operability of the centrifuge technology at the pilot plant in Piketon, OH, and the development and test facility in the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) Building K-1600. Maintaining these near-term domestic-origin technologies that could produce low enriched uranium unencumbered by peaceful-use restrictions is important while U.S. Interagency Policy Committee develops the best path forward to meet our national security requirements for enriched uranium.
