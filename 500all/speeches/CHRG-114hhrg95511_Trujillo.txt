    Ms. Trujillo. Thank you. Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Costa, and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to appear before you today on behalf of the Office of Inspector General for USAID, and we appreciate the Committee's interest in our work to improve the effectiveness in international food aid programs. Let me just start out by saying that elements of risk are inherent in all of USAID programs, including food assistance.    USAID works in environments that are very vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse, and working in fragile countries where there are weak operational and financial systems, there is insufficient capacity, deteriorating infrastructure, it makes it ever so critical that USAID manage and design its programs, and then in considering each one of these risk elements. And for that reason we conduct our audits and our investigations in a way where we focus on the higher levels of risk that surround USAID assistance programs.    In the last 5 years we have conducted 12 performance audits and reviews, and reported almost 100 recommendations to USAID to promote the effectiveness and the management of their food aid programs. Together with our investigative work and our audit work, our work has produced more than $18 million in savings and cost recoveries for the U.S. Government.    Now, our work has primarily addressed the controls and the performance surrounding the efforts in transport, storage, monetizing, and distributing food aid commodities, along with assessing the results of those programs that USAID is designing to deal with: hunger, malnutrition, agricultural productivity, and helping countries be more resilient to conflict.    Across that supply chain distribution, our audits and our investigations have identified risks in all areas, in how USAID manages its food programs with Title II commodities. For example, let us just start with shipping and transport. Just last month the Department of Justice reached an $836,000 settlement with a shipping company that is used by USAID for food transport. Our investigations concluded that that company had been billing USAID for higher prices than it should have, and that had been going on for about 4 years.    We have also reported weaknesses in internal controls at USAID implementers' levels critical to safeguarding those commodities. Through our direct observations and our validation of inventory, we have identified discrepancies with what the implementer is saying is on hand, and what we have been able to verify. And that is often because there are weak internal controls. There is poor record-keeping. There is improper segregation of duties. There is mishandling of commodities. There are poor storage conditions. And these weak controls also make food vulnerable to theft as well. For example, in East Africa U.S. commodities were siphoned off, and they had been sold for an extended period of time. And, as a result of our investigation, USAID actually had to terminate this $100 million program.    And we have also identified problems with USAID's management of the programs that are designed to help those populations in need. Our work in Madagascar, for example, noted that implementing partners had designed different distribution methods, and, as a result of inconsistency, some beneficiaries were not getting the rations that they needed when they needed them the most. In Uganda we found poor program management, where some individuals were getting commodities that were not part of the targeted population.    In Haiti we found that cooperating sponsors had failed to adopt demonstrated best practices, and, as a result, the program failed to reach the optimized number of mothers with infants. And also in Haiti we saw overlapping with Title II programs and USAID programs. As a result, a few beneficiaries get more than what they are entitled to, and some get less.    In Somalia we found inconsistencies on how USAID vendors and sub-recipients were using best practices, with regards to vetting their vendors and their sub-recipients. We have reduced assurance in those areas that USAID is making sure that they are examining whether all these groups have any ties to armed, or terrorist groups, or any other prohibited parties.    We also audited USAID's approach to pre-positioning commodities in the Horn of Africa, and there we noted that USAID had not compared the respective costs and benefits of pre-positioning food in the international ports, compared to what it would cost to ship them from the United States, despite the fact that there was an earlier analysis that had demonstrated that shipping from an international area could cost up to seven times more.    Lack of key monitoring is a key finding, frequent with all our findings, and that often explains why these problems have gone unnoticed, and other problems that we have identified. For example, poor data quality. We have identified a lack of financial oversight, which the GAO report also recognized. And also, not complying with branding and marketing issues. Because of lack of monitoring, these issues are not identified in a timely manner, or they are identified when the audits are performed.    Monitoring deficiencies are of particular concern to us in conflicted area settings. A substantial amount of food that USAID gives is going to these types of areas, and because of security concerns USAID--U.S. direct hires cannot get out--Americans cannot get out and actually see these activities. And, therefore, we take very seriously any thefts or reports, and we actively investigate those, like in areas such as Syria.    Now, I don't want to just leave this on a negative point, because, as Congressman Costa said, this is an important program, and we have seen successes in in-kind commodities. We have talked to direct beneficiaries, who had chronic health issues, and they have shared with us that they have received these commodities, and their health has improved. We have spoken with farmers who said they are seeing improved productivity. They are actually seeing that they are able to now use new technologies that they are learning under the Food for Peace Program. So this is a positive aspect of the in-kind commodity programs.    Moving forward, we plan to continue to execute our oversight plans----    Ms. Trujillo. I am so sorry.    The Chairman.--about 2 minutes over. That is okay. You can make it up during the answering of questions.    Ms. Trujillo. I apologize.    The Chairman. No problem. Mr. DeSmet?        STATEMENT OF RODNEY G. DeSMET, DEPUTY ASSISTANT    Ms. Trujillo. As I shared in my testimony, we have covered, in the last 5 years, 12 different audits and reviews. Looking across the entire body of work, monitoring has been an issue that we have identified as a cause for many of the problems that we have seen in the management of these programs.    So we have reported that as a program deficiency with USAID's oversight, and also too the oversight responsibilities that the different implementing partners are responsible to do as well. As part of their plans they are required to identify their monitoring plans. And we often find those plans lacking in implementation.    The Chairman. Well, as a natural follow up, could we not see the same, if not worse, problems with cash-based assistance?    Ms. Trujillo. And as I mentioned, there is risk that is inherent in everything that USAID does. Whether they are using any type of cash modalities, local regional purchases, or the in-kind, yes, if there are vulnerabilities, and USAID is not taking the appropriate actions to mitigate those vulnerabilities and those risks, we are going to see losses, and we are going to see a higher risk of loss in those areas. USAID works in the environments, as Congressman Costa said, that are vulnerable for fraud, waste, and abuse, so it is critical that those internal controls and those mechanisms are put in place for any kind of modality that USAID uses.    The Chairman. Mr. Melito, in our last hearing it was implied by USAID that delivery of immediate cash was very limited. Yet, as many of you know, during a full Committee hearing I sit almost up there at the witness table, I heard this firsthand. The USAID witness stated it is not cash in terms of $100 bills, it is vouchers. Now, is it true that cash assistance is only in the form of vouchers, or are you aware of cases where USAID is indeed handing out cold, hard cash for food assistance?    Ms. Trujillo. I have to echo Mr. Melito's comments. USAID has to make complex decisions on how they are going to balance that, and it is important that those----    Ms. Trujillo. One size does not fit all, correct.    Ms. Trujillo. Thank you for that question. Our investigators are very aggressive, as I mentioned, in following up with any allegations of criminal acts or fraud. In the cases where the investigations have concluded that a criminal act was done, we work with the Department of Justice, we work to get these cases----    Ms. Trujillo. Well, if it is an American-based implementer, we will be working through--with--notifying the embassy, but we are working largely with the Justice Department here in the United States to resolve these and take actions.    Ms. Trujillo. Yes.    Ms. Trujillo. Right.    Ms. Trujillo. Right.    Mr. Costa.--if you work with them as well.    Ms. Trujillo. We do have investigators that are actually posted overseas, and we cover USAID regionally through these overseas offices. These investigators do collaborate with the other law enforcement agencies that are there, so there is coordinated investigative efforts on any allegations of fraud, especially those that cut across the different agencies there, yes.    Ms. Trujillo. Thank you for that question. It is USAID's responsibility to identify up front, as part of their program design, what are those risk factors that they need to consider in doing exactly what you are talking about. When they set up a program in country--much of the Food for Peace programs are centrally managed here out of Washington, so Washington should be involved in that. They set up those metrics. They set up what those controls are, and they should be monitoring that. That is their responsibility. Our responsibility, as an oversight body, is to make sure that those processes and procedures are being followed.    Now, why did----    Ms. Trujillo. Why----    Mr. Yoho.--there. You are supposed to monitor and make sure they are being followed, but yet when I look at what Mr. DeSmet said, that FAS, since 1999--OIG recommended they make these changes, that is 16 years it takes. It sounds like the changes weren't made to be held accountable. Why is that?    Ms. Trujillo. Is this for Mr.----    Ms. Trujillo. Well, I just wanted to mention, our oversight effort is on the ground, as you mentioned. We are looking at the activity. So for every one of these examples that I gave you, we provided recommendations to address the cause for why monitoring wasn't happening effectively. It is USAID's responsibility, and we followed up with those actions that they have taken.    So for that one particular activity, we will go back, and we will look to see, have those actions been implemented? And often the case it hasn't. That has been one activity. USAID implements hundreds of activities. So----    Ms. Trujillo. Okay.    Ms. Trujillo. Well, that particular issue was discussed when we talked about data quality. Data is important. Data is what is used to make decisions. And in this particular case, an implementer is identifying to USAID and reporting that they have reached a certain number of beneficiaries. And when we go out and we verify the information that they have stored, their data, we identify that, no, they either misrepresented that number because of errors in their monitoring and evaluation system, so they are over-reporting what they have actually achieved on that one particular activity. And that is what we meant by that.    Ms. Trujillo. This was the situation in East Africa, where it was commodities--it was wheat that was siphoned off, taken to a milling factory, made into flour, and then sold internationally.    Ms. Trujillo. You know what, I don't have--forgive me.    Ms. Trujillo. Can I get back to you----    Ms. Trujillo. Okay.    Ms. Trujillo. When we design our audits to look at USAID's programs that are intended to reach individuals who have these nutritional needs, we look to that to see if the commodities, the food that they are getting, is being distributed in accordance with the way they intended to distribute it. If we were to identify in any situation that those populations were not getting that, that would be one of our findings in our report.    Ms. Trujillo. As far as coordination, I can't speak to that specifically----    Ms. Trujillo. No, I am just saying that, in the course of our oversight work, I mean, we conduct performance audits----    Ms. Trujillo. Yes, I can. I apologize for my technical vernacular. USAID uses one implementer, who then might be sub-implementing with other partners. Each partner has maybe a geographic responsibility. The concern, and what we have brought up many times, is that even though USAID is working with one partner, who is working with four partners, everyone is pretty much working how they see as it best fits their needs.    But sometimes there are best practices that could be adopted across all of the implementing partners to ensure that there is fairness and equity across all the distributions. We don't see that. Sometimes somebody is doing a practice that is much better than others, but it is not being effectively coordinated.    Ms. Trujillo. Yes.    Mr. King.--as well as sometimes it gets out of control. It is the----    Ms. Trujillo. Correct.    Mr. King.--nature of the beast.    Ms. Trujillo. So we see more efficient work in one area than we see in the other, and it is under the same program.    Ms. Trujillo. Well, that is what I was going to end with, before I ran out of time. Our ongoing effort, moving forward, we are going to be focusing on Feed the Future, and looking at exactly this. We are going to be looking at how USAID is implementing programs to improve agricultural value chains, to teach new technologies to farmers so that they can be more productive.    So this is going to be a focus not only with Feed the Future in Haiti, and in--I lost my train of thought on the next one. But anyway, we have our plan moving forward for 2016, and we have identified Feed the Future as one of our priority areas moving----    Ms. Trujillo. And as well, if I could just add, during the course of our work, as I said, we are on the ground. We will verify with the beneficiaries, asking them did they know, first of all, what they were supposed to receive, and did they receive it? And we try to verify what was the quality of it, and is it helping as it was intended to help?    Ms. Trujillo. And that is a very important question.    Ms. Trujillo. Yes, that is a very important question, yes.    When we do meet a lot of bad guys, and so we coordinate closely with USAID. We work to have either the individual or the company debarred, suspended, so that they cannot----    Ms. Trujillo. Well----    Yes. Well, all of these risks need to be considered in the actual procurement.    Ms. Trujillo. Where USAID operates, in the mission office, which they operate in close to 100 countries, there are contracting officers and agreement officers who have that responsibility to take proper due diligence, and ensure that, during the solicitation process and the award process, that there are decisions made, and they have gone through and determined if there are any individuals who shouldn't be receiving awards, they are not getting it. Now, is it foolproof?    Ms. Trujillo. You will----    Ms. Trujillo. Well, USAID, as you know, in Haiti they run a mission as well that has all the sectors. They work in agricultural and development, health, education. On those portfolios, where they are also trying to reach beneficiaries to help them with health issues, and with food issues, they are running programs. The Food for Peace office is running programs as well. And in these cases, where there is a lack of coordination between the two offices within USAID, we have seen where activities have actually gone on top of each other.    Ms. Trujillo. No. The policy is that they are supposed to make sure that they----    Ms. Trujillo. My experience, because I have worked in the field for many years, I have seen oftentimes, as you have, especially in an emergency situation like Haiti, where you have many implementers trying to get on the ground and roll out activities quickly, oftentimes coordination amongst the offices are hindered.    Ms. Trujillo. You know what, I am--I--let me----    Ms. Trujillo. I will----    Ms. Trujillo.--get back to you on that.    Mr. Conaway.--different issue. If you----    Ms. Trujillo. I don't want----    Ms. Trujillo. I will get back to you. Thank you. I appreciate your questions.    Ms. Trujillo. I understand.    Ms. Trujillo. And if I could share, as Tom mentioned, our work too is relatively new. We have more work planned for this next year, but we did conduct an audit of the Food for Peace activities that are being implemented for Syria. And the during the extent of our travels we too could not travel into Syria, but what we did is we looked at each of the implementing partner's controls. We looked to see how they were monitoring, and how they were validating to ensure that--and we were looking at flour that was being sent to bakeries, what they were doing to ensure that the flour actually got to the bakery.    And so they were implementing various different types of mechanisms, to have third party monitoring, volunteers in Syria to call back to the implementers to confirm delivery of the flour. But the biggest challenge is the fact that there is nobody from USAID who can go in and do that direct kind of monitoring.    Ms. Trujillo. And that----    Ms. Trujillo. Well, it is testing the controls that the implementers have in place. Working--trying to get access to these third--getting access to these third party monitors. The World Food Programme, their OIG, actually, was able to send people into Syria and do a much more thorough test of the controls of World Food Peace--World Food Programme's implementers.    Ms. Trujillo. And they identified very much similar issues that we have identified----    Ms. Trujillo. I don't know. I can't answer that question. I am----    Ms. Trujillo. Okay, I will.    Ms. Trujillo. I mentioned in my statement that, under the Food for Peace we have been looking at USAID's role in providing assistance to these farmers and teaching them new ways on agriculture. And in many cases we have spoken to these recipients who have seen positive results. They need to be seen on a much broader scale, so that when these countries do have conflict, they are resilient enough to get through it. And this is a large scale program that is a priority.    Ms. Trujillo. Yes. I----    Ms. Trujillo. Thank you for that question. Over the last 5 years, as Tom has mentioned, and you have read, in-kind is still the bulk of the food assistance that USAID is responsible for. The use of the cash modalities with Title II funding it is a relatively new concept. As the level of funding continues to grow, then we look at our work based on where is the highest risk?    And so as the level of cash modalities grows, the risk grows, and we will be then redirecting our resources to focus on that area of the management of the cash, and the controls of the cash.
