    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning.    We all are aware of the constantly evolving cyber threats to information systems, as seen by the many breaches that have recently occurred in both the private and public sectors. The Federal Information Security Management Act is another important piece of legislation that requires the agency and inspector general to assess the state of their information security management.    Dr. Harris, my committee, the IT Subcommittee, held a hearing in November on the Department's compliance with FISMA based on the IG audit report. We learned the Department heavily relies on contractors for its IT systems. We also heard that, although progress has been made on IT security, continued improvement is needed. You acknowledged this need for improvement in your opening statement. Can you tell me what your top priority is in this space?    Ms. Kelly. You might have answered this and I wasn't in the room, but do you feel like you have the staff and the resources that you need to complete your goals?    Ms. Kelly. And the reason I ask oftentimes people say they can't find the people to carry out the tasks because everyone is, public and private sector, looking for experts on cybersecurity, and of course government doesn't pay what the private sector pays. So are you finding that also?    Ms. Kelly. Okay. Thank you. And I just ask that you keep this committee updated as you continue to address the weaknesses in the Department's security systems identified by the IG. Thank you.    Ms. Kelly. Yes, I will.
