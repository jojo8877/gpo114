    Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. The U.S. trade promotion agencies play a critical role in boosting U.S. exports. They provide the bulwark against foreign governments that heavily subsidize their own domestic industries. In my western New York community, the Export-Import Bank has supported over $100 million in exports and more than 600 jobs.    Furthermore, the Export-Import Bank is self-sustaining and has generated more than $7 billion in excess revenues to the United States Treasury. Failing to undertake a long-term reauthorization of the Bank would only serve to hurt American businesses and workers. I look forward to the discussion today. Thank you for being here.
