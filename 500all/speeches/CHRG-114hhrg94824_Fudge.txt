    Ms. Fudge. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you all for being here and for your testimony.    Mr. Chairman, here we are again. We are here at the same place we were before talking about states' rights. Here we are again, moving back in time to a place where we want to ignore established law, we want to once again put states in a position to make a determination as to who should work and who should not. We have come to a point where we are disproportionately once again affecting populations who are poor and populations of color.    I listen to the governor talk about what happened back in 1953. Mr. Mix talked about what happened in 1944. That was before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It was before the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It was before nondiscrimination labor laws. So let's not talk about the past. Let's deal with established law.    Professor Bruno, you talked about, or gave us examples of workers who are costing the government more money because they are in right-to-work states. Could you expand upon that, please?    Ms. Fudge. So basically then you are saying that you have data to prove that people who are on government assistance are not just lazy, just don't want to work? We are talking about working people; correct?    Ms. Fudge. Just wanted to make sure about that.    Ms. Fudge. Thank you very much.    Ms. Gould, could you please elaborate on the institute's findings that over the last 10 years, there has been a lost--it has been a lost decade for American workers?    Ms. Fudge. Professor--oh. Let me go back to Ms. Gould.    In a resent paper, the Economic Policy Institute states that productivity grew by 74 percent since 1973 while hourly compensation of a typical worker grew just 9.2 percent. How has collective bargaining played in that, one way or another?    Ms. Fudge. Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
