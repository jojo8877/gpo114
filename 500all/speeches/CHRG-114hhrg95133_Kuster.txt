    Ms. Kuster. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for appearing before us today. My question is maybe in a small corner of the world, but it is important to my State of New Hampshire. I have heard concerns from American dairy farmers including those in the Northeast about the potential for increased imports into our country of New Zealand dairy products and about a potential unfair advantage posed by New Zealand's largest dairy cooperative which controls over 90 percent of that country's dairy market. And I am interested in your opinion about the impact that this anti-competitive market structure could have on America's small and family-owned dairies and again, I said particularly in the Northeast but maybe in other parts of the country.    Ms. Kuster. And what in particular, with Canada, what would that look like? How would you anticipate that playing out? What would the actions that would happen--    Ms. Kuster. Sure, and you can appreciate the concern from Members of Congress trying to make these decisions. I will end here, but just to comment, it is becoming more and more difficult to even be in the business of dairy in small family farms which are critical for us in the Northeast. I have talked to dairy farmers. We are in a very, very brief drought. It doesn't hardly happen in New England and it is particularly unusual this time of year. And they just have said to me recently, this is too hard. We can't be giving it away. So you can imagine the impact of these types of decisions. So thank you so much. I appreciate your testimony. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back. Mr. Thompson, 5 minutes.
