    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. King, thank you for joining us today.    I wanted to focus my question on higher ed. The district I represent in the north country in New York State, I consistently hear from students, financial aid administrators, concerned parents that our financial aid system is overly complex and nonintuitive. And I believe that instead of confusing students, our aid system should enable individuals to quickly attain the skills necessary to work and to contribute to our economy.    Which is why last year, along with my colleagues, Mr. Curbelo and Mr. Hinojosa, I introduced the Flexible Pell Grant for 21st Century Students Act. And I thank you for your positive comments on the year-round Pell bill. And I also want to thank my colleagues, Ms. Clark and Mr. Polis, for their positive comments on year-round Pell, and I encourage them to cosponsor this bill.    Not only does this bill encourage students to complete their degrees at an accelerated pace, but the bill also directs the Secretary to provide annual financial aid reports to Pell students to help them make the right financial decisions for their unique situation.    So my question for you is, in the year ahead, how do you intend to ensure that we are providing all students with the necessary counseling, especially those most in need as they navigate postsecondary education with a very complex student loan repayment program?    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you very much. I look forward to working with you and the administration on this issue to simplify a very complex program that is causing significant heartburn to students and parents and administrators at our higher ed institutions. Thanks.    I yield back.
