    Mr. Mullin. No, thank you.    Mr. Mullin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And just so I don't mess up your last name, Paul came and introduced himself to me earlier. He is from the great State of Oklahoma, went to Bishop Kelley in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I guess your parents still live in Bixby?    Mr. Mullin. And so it is always good to see a friendly face in town.    My first question would be for Mr. Malta. We just heard the conversation about our attorney generals, and so I am going to kind of stay on that focus. My own State of Oklahoma has laws specifically against abuse of patent demand letters. I want to make sure that my constituents are also protected from these type of letters, and if our committee drafts legislation prohibiting these types of letters, should attorney generals be able to enforce those laws?    Mr. Mullin. My next question is for Ms. Self. What if Qualcomm was hit from a law suit, let us say, from Oklahoma's attorney general then Vermont's attorney general, then say Illinois' attorney general, should a company be exposed to liability from every State enforcement agency? If not, why not?    Mr. Mullin. Thank you. And I will try to be quick on this last question for Mr. Malta. The Realtors that you represent are exactly the type of small businesses that are near and dear to my heart. Could you please tell us specifically the type of information that needs to be included in a demand letter that would allow businesses that receive them to understand what they are accused of, and to what extent they need to take legal action on?    Mr. Mullin. Thank you.    I yield back.
