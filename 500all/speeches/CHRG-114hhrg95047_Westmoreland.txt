    Mr. Westmoreland. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. Basically, FHA is a mortgage insurance company, correct?    Mr. Westmoreland. What percentage of the mortgage does FHA guarantee?    Mr. Westmoreland. For a normal mortgage insurance company, what percentage of the value do they insure, typically?    Mr. Westmoreland. Well, not necessarily. But what would they go up to?    Mr. Westmoreland. They guarantee 80 percent of the mortgage?    Mr. Westmoreland. Okay. So if the mortgage is, if the house is $100,000--    Mr. Westmoreland. So if you have a $100,000 house, with an $80,000 mortgage, the private insurance company will insure the whole $80,000?    Mr. Westmoreland. FHA, what is that number?    Mr. Westmoreland. Of the mortgage amount?    Mr. Westmoreland. And what percent does that private mortgage insurance company--    Mr. Westmoreland. Okay. So you all--you insure quite a bit more, correct?    Mr. Westmoreland. I am a little confused here about a couple of things in your testimony. I am a builder. I was a builder, and a real estate agent. And in your testimony, you said that home building had doubled. Since when?    Mr. Westmoreland. Could you get me where you saw that information--    Mr. Westmoreland. --because I want to share it with some people at home.    Mr. Westmoreland. Okay, thank you. And also, but you said home prices have rebounded about 20 percent in the last 3 years. Could you get me that data, too? Because I want to share that with my appraiser, so we can go over that.    The other thing you said in testimony is that the average fees I guess you will collect is $17,000, and FHA expects that the average loss from borrowers for these loans would be $4,700. So you are insuring 97 percent, or 95 percent of the loan, but if something goes south, you are only going to lose $4,700?    Mr. Westmoreland. Okay. Can you tell me how many mortgages you all insured in 2014?    Mr. Westmoreland. Do you know how many loans that you will insure in 2015?    Mr. Westmoreland. About 800,000?    Mr. Westmoreland. Okay. You were talking about how many loans that you did. How many of those loans in 2014 were refinance loans, and how many do you project will be refinance loans in 2015?    Mr. Westmoreland. Okay. But you don't know what dollar amount those loans are going to bring in, correct?    Mr. Westmoreland. And I know that you were mayor of San Antonio. Did you ever lower taxes?    Mr. Westmoreland. You lowered your taxes in town? Did your revenues go up?    Mr. Westmoreland. Okay, so you cut your taxes and revenue went up. Sounds like a good idea to me.
