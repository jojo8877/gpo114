    Mr. Lujan. Mr. Chairman, thank you so very much, and to Mr. Davis and Mr. Kennedy, thank you both for being here.    Mr. Kennedy, as you know, before the establishment of FirstNet, my home State of New Mexico was the recipient of a BTOP grant to support the development of a public safety wireless system, and it is my understanding the FirstNet and New Mexico have reached a spectrum licensing agreement in this space. Can you give us an idea if this is indeed going to be completed by September 30?    Mr. Lujan. Well, since you went there, Mr. Kennedy, I will jump right to that question that I had for you is--New Mexico is one of the many States that has a complexity of jurisdictions with local, State, Federal Government, as you named, and--namely being a border State, with Border and Customs as well. Has the dynamic presented any unique challenges that you have seen, or that you anticipated?    Mr. Lujan. And you have heard a lot of questions from those of us that represent rural States as well. What lessons learned in a State with geography like we have in New Mexico, where it is large and land based, as well--we have amazing mountains ski areas as well, so sometimes that gets in the way of transmission of some of the communications services, where you can drop service here and there, because it is so--such a big State. So what have we learned that we will be able to deploy in other States?    Mr. Lujan. And in your testimony, Mr. Kennedy, you also outlined the establishment of a tribal working group, and hiring a tribal liaison as well. Can you provide more detail on FirstNet's efforts to ensure robust tribal consultation? And, in addition to that, I understand that you recently had a session in Santa Fe, New Mexico. If you could let us know what the next steps are?
