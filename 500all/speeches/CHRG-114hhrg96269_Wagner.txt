    Ms. Wagner. The National Park Service is a Bureau within the Department of the Interior, and U.S. Forest Service, of course, is within the Department of Agriculture. We share many boundaries with the National Park Service. I can think of the Olympic National Forest as a good example on the Olympic Peninsula, which is surrounded by the Olympic National Forest. So the park and the forest are inextricably connected and connected with the communities that we serve, both on the forest and in the National Park. So we do a lot of collaborative work together.    We coordinate well together. We share resources. We have authority from Congress called Service First which allows us to provide seamless visitor services so when people come into an office, they will be greeted by somebody and get information on both the National Park and the Forest Service.    Our goals are a little bit different. The Park Service is focused on preservation and conservation. They interpret for visitors the scenic, cultural, historic values of a National Park. The National Forests are guided by the principles of multiple use management and sustained yield. So we like to think of the National Forests as working landscapes, as places where people not only get the benefits that accrue from having public lands called National Forests, but also they see them as working to provide things like wood fiber, livestock grazing, minerals development, energy development.    The Chairman. In terms of specifics, though, there is no real difference between a healthy forest on National Forest land and a healthy forest on a National Park. I understand the difference in what the Park Service is doing, but do they manage their forests to a healthy level the way you do?    Ms. Wagner. In the National Park Service they have a much more limited footprint in terms of active management of forests, though they do some hazardous fuels treatment and do manage forests to some degree by use of prescribed fire and natural fire in their parks. We tend to take a little bit more of a working stance on National Forests where we have timber sale contracts, stewardship contracts, as tools to help create resiliency in those forests.    The Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Peterson, for 5 minutes.    Ms. Wagner. It may be that with a situation that Hurricane Katrina brought on the landscape, we had provisions to deal with emergency treatment and----    Ms. Wagner. And so is it comparing emergency response to just basic forest management and forest restoration today that you are----    Ms. Wagner. Excellent question. We are very committed to using all of the tools available to us under the National Environmental Policy Act to act quickly, to be adaptive, to use the right kind of analysis for the right kind of situation. We found that in the last 4 years, we have actually reduced the number of NEPA analyses done and decisions done, so we are getting better at larger-scale, fewer decisions. And we are reducing the amount of time.    Now, that is nationally. I would be happy to follow up and get you some more detail relative to----    Ms. Wagner. Across all restoration, it is probably around 250,000 of mechanical treatment for timber sales.    Ms. Wagner. I might just add that timber harvest does increase despite the fact that our staff has decreased by \1/3\ since 1998. We are finding a lot of efficiencies to sell a board-foot of timber at reduced costs, so we found efficiencies internally.    With our National Environmental Policy Act efficiencies, we have also, based on scale collaboration, we have exciting ventures where we are using adaptive approaches with insects and disease where we are forecasting a future 5 to 10 years out without having to do additional NEPA.    Congress has also given us authority for the collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, 23 projects across the nation. They are accelerating the reduction of fire risk, improving forest health, eradicating noxious weeds and producing board-feet, creating jobs as well. So those are on track to meet their 10 year goals.    And the authorities through the farm bill, insects and disease authority, good neighbor authority, and permanent stewardship contracting authority. So we have a great set of tools, and we are making the most of the resources that we have.    The Chairman. I want to thank Secretary Bonnie; thank you, Chief Weller; and Chief Wagner, thank you. I think you have all so graciously agreed to meet with Members privately in 1306 while we transition. So, again, thank you very much for coming in today. I know it is a hassle. We appreciate it. If you all will go down to 1306, Members who want to have a quick conversation with you individually will do that, and then we will get the other panel in.    So we stand in recess while we swap out the panels. Thank you all very, very much.    The Chairman. Okay. Let's go ahead and start.    I want to welcome my third panel. The good news is, the Department of Labor's overtime rules aren't going into effect until January. So it probably wouldn't apply to you guys anyway. I think some of us are going to try to stop that anyway.    So anyway, I want to welcome our third panel. Thank you very much for being here this afternoon. We have today with us the Honorable Catherine Woteki, who is the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics, USDA. Thank you for being here.    We have Dr. Chavonda Jacobs-Young, who is Administrator at the Agricultural Research Service. Thank you; Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy, who is the Director of National Institute of Food and Agriculture; Dr. Mary Bohman, who is the Administrator for Economic Research Service; and we have Renee Picanso, Associate Administrator for the National Agricultural Statistics Service. So thank you very much for being here today.    Under Secretary, the floor is yours.        STATEMENT OF HON. CATHERINE WOTEKI, Ph.D., UNDER          ACCOMPANIED BY CHAVONDA JACOBS-YOUNG, Ph.D.,              RAMASWAMY, Ph.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE, USDA; MARY BOHMAN, Ph.D.,
