    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to holding this hearing. It's important that the citizens of our great country, whether they agree or disagree with the policies that come from Congress or come from agencies, that they can expect that we play within--within the boundaries of the playing field using the rules of play. So I appreciate this--this hearing.    Mr. Sullivan, the EPA inspector general confirmed that Moure-Eraso, Loeb, and Horowitz violated the Federal Records Act. Are you certain that you've determined the entire scope of their use of private email accounts?    Mr. Walberg. Well, based upon your investigation, were any other CSB employees or Board members involved in the use of private email accounts to conduct official business with Moure-Eraso, Loeb, or Horowitz?    Mr. Walberg. Have Moure-Eraso, Loeb, or Horowitz taken steps to ensure that their previous private email communications have been entered in the CSB records?    Mr. Walberg. At this time----    Mr. Walberg. OK. Mr. Moure-Eraso, have you taken steps to include all private email communications that you used to conduct official CSB business into the Federal record?    Mr. Walberg. Dr. Moure-Eraso, let me make it very clear, under oath, you are stating this----    Mr. Walberg. Let me move further on this. Is--is--you indicated that your personal email account to seek--was used to seek Mr. Loeb's legal opinion on draft communications as part of the communication that you had. Is that the only subject matter contained in these emails?    Mr. Walberg. Well, did--did you in fact use a personal email address to conduct almost all CSB business that involved Loeb and Horowitz?    Mr. Walberg. Mr. Sullivan, what is your understanding of the subject matter of emails exchanged between Moure-Eraso, Loeb, and Horowitz that violated the Federal Records Act.    Mr. Walberg. Is that the document that Mr. Moure-Eraso referred to?    Mr. Walberg. OK. Thank you.    My time is expired.
