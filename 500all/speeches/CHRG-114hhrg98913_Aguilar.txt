    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate the report and the work that you are doing.    Dr. Parker, you touched on this a little bit, and the chairman mentioned it, the coordination between DHS and DOD. Can you talk a little bit about that and the role within the biomedical advanced research groups and DOD as well, what more we can do to foster that? The chairman mentioned obviously the potential to have events abroad and here nationally as well. I represent the city of San Bernardino where the incident was last month, and obviously it could have gone a different way.    And so making sure that the coordination between local law enforcement agencies also exists within a DHS interface or DOD interface is something that I think our communities also want to see us take serious.    Mr. Aguilar. No, no, absolutely, and we wouldn't indicate that. But areas, specific ways that we can use the committee and use the work that we are doing to highlight those positive examples as well as areas of deficiency where we can continue to improve, I think is important.    Mr. Aguilar. Sure.    Mr. Aguilar. Mr. Wainstein, anything to add?    Mr. Aguilar. Mr. Chairman, I will yield back. Thank you.    Mr. Aguilar. Just one more question, gentlemen, since we have you and I get one more bite at the apple. And, Dr. Parker, you talked about leadership. And could you just describe to me the discussion and the decision by the panel to institutionalize and empower the Vice President as the kind of point of contact and the focal point within the report?    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you.
