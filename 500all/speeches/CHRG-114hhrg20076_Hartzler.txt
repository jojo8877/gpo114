    Mrs. Hartzler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    You know, one of the greatest privileges that we have as Members of Congress is to get to appoint or nominate young people for the service academies. And I know that there is a merchant marine academy. I have had the privilege of sending a young lady from our district there. She loves it. And she and her family can't say enough great things about it.    So looking at the shortfall that you are talking about here in manpower, can you just give me kind of an update? I haven't had the privilege yet of visiting, it is on my to-do list. But how many people are going through the academy, and if you think this might be a bright spot in helping meet these shortfalls?    Mrs. Hartzler. Do you see any opportunity or changes being made in your training and your recruitment of young people to help make up the shortfall? So if I heard you right, you need 70,000 new people by 2022----    Mrs. Hartzler . And you are only graduating about 900 a year. So what are some other programs that you have out there to try to meet the shortfall?    Mrs. Hartzler. Well, I commend you for thinking outside the box. I think especially targeting veterans, I think, makes a lot of sense. And if there is any help that we can provide to helping so that they qualify more easily, it just makes a lot of sense and I know we will be here ready to help.    Mrs. Hartzler. Thank you. I yield back.
