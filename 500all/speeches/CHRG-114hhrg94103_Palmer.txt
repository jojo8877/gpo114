    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    If you would, could we show the OMP--the OPM survey and the CSB worker satisfaction slide. Thank you.    Chairman Moure-Eraso, if you look at these statistics on employee satisfaction, they indicate an agency in turmoil. In particular, it would appear from this that the satisfaction of your senior leadership, which in this case would seem to be yourself as Chairman, your top staff, such as Mr. Loeb and Mr. Horowitz, why do you think these numbers are so low?    Mr. Palmer. Let me ask Mr. Griffon and the rest of the Board, but particularly Mr. Griffon, as long as you work with the Chairman, you might have some more detailed thoughts on this. Can you give us some insights into why you think these numbers are so low?    Mr. Palmer. Yes, sir.    Mr. Palmer. We already covered that, I think, earlier in the hearing.    Mr. Palmer. Go ahead.    Mr. Palmer. That's noted. Thank you.    Mr. Palmer. Mr. Griffon, would you please briefly explain Board Order 28. On January 28, there was a motion which rescinded Board Order 28 which established significant checks on the chairman. Would you explain that?    Mr. Palmer. Quickly.    Mr. Palmer. Do you believe that Chairman Moure-Eraso adhered to these, to Board Order 28?    Mr. Palmer. Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter Board Order 28 into the record.    Mr. Palmer. My time is expired. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, the witnesses.
