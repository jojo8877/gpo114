    Ms. CHAVEZ. I believe----    Ms. CHAVEZ. Thank you.    Ms. CHAVEZ. Thank you very much. My name is Marilupe Chavez. I am with JCJ Chavez. We are also a woman-owned small business in construction. I understand where Ms. Villa is coming from.    Ms. CHAVEZ. I am actually out of Ridgecrest, China Lake.    Ms. CHAVEZ. I just recently received my 8(a) certification, and there are a lot of areas. Part of it is bonding. I want to compete as a prime contractor. I have a past performance as a subcontractor. But the bonding, it is now my dilemma.    I have certain amount of bond, but in order for me to get a job contract or an IDIQ, I have to be at a higher bond. I believe that being a small business, and, again, I do not call myself a small business. I actually call myself a micro business still. I feel that there should be a cost set aside for companies like mine that are just coming up in the construction business.    Everything that Ms. Villa said, I am 100 percent there.    Ms. CHAVEZ. Yes. All the barriers that she talked about, I am facing all those barriers also.
