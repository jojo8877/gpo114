    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you for your being here today. I have a couple of questions, and I would like as short an answer as possible.    So, with regard to the one breach that involved the 4.2 million employees, those are actual employees and retirees. That is a closed system. We know how many that is.    With regard to the individuals whose information was in a system because background checks were being done with them, A, we don't know how many; B, every one of those individuals didn't ultimately get a job, so we have some people's information who aren't even employed by the Federal Government.    Is that yes--is that true, Ms. Archuleta?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Okay.    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Right.    So, in that second breach of that universe that is so large, that information was breached through a breach in the security of KeyPoint? Is that true, Ms. Archuleta? Is that----    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Someone who had credentials with----    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you.    Mrs. Watson Coleman. So who is trying to identify all the universe that has been compromised through the latter breach? Is it KeyPoint who is trying to clean up its mess, or is it----    Mrs. Watson Coleman. --OPM?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Okay.    So Mr. McFarland has made a number of observations and recommendations, and I believe that I was left with the feeling that he didn't believe that OPM was moving in the right direction, on the right path to get to where it needs to go. And so I was also informed that his recommendations or his findings are a result of auditors and specialists in this area.    So I have two questions for you, Ms. Archuleta. Number one is, are you using experts and the same kinds of skill sets that Mr. McFarland is using in looking at the same things that he is looking at, number one? And, number two, do you agree with his recommendations? And if not, on what areas do you disagree?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Okay.    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you. I kind of get the drift then.    Tell me what you think is the timeframe for the IG's office and your office--and, Mr. McFarland, you might weigh in--necessary to get to where we need to get. Not that all these things are going to be implemented, but that we agree on what needs to be done. Are we talking about 3 months from now? Thirty days from now? Six months from now? Do we have any idea?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Do we still have contracts with KeyPoint?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. And KeyPoint--this is to Mr. Hess, I believe.    How many contracts with how many departments do you have?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Okay. And so, are your contracts active contracts? Are they coming to an end? Or are you at the end of these contracts? What is the----    Mrs. Watson Coleman. They are all active contracts.    Mr. McFarland, should we be ceasing our relationship with KeyPoint?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. That we should. That we----    Mrs. Watson Coleman. That we should cease.    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Should not.    Ms. Archuleta, do you agree with that?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. So but my question is, should we cease contracting with them? Mr. McFarland says yes, and you said yes----    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Both of you said no. Okay.    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Okay. I am sorry. Thank you very much.    Mr. McFarland, last question to you. What are the three important things that we need to do just to get us back on the right track, and how long do you think it should take?    And that will be the end of my questioning, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much.    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you.    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
