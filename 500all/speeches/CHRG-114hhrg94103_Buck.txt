    Mr. Buck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Sullivan, what's the purpose, in one sentence or less, if you can, for me, what's the purpose of the Federal Records Act?    Mr. Buck. OK. That's two sentences but still good.    Tell me who is responsible for that.    Mr. Buck. Why do we have a Records Act?    Mr. Buck. OK.    What would happen--how does someone set up a private email system on their public computer, on their office computer?    Mr. Buck. OK.    My understanding is that there is a policy that was issued by the President of the United States that would prohibit private emails on government computers, Federal Government computers.    Mr. Buck. OK. So say it--say that again. What is the directive?    Mr. Buck. And if someone used a private email account on their government computer, they're sending that email, typically, to other people in government.    Mr. Buck. But if they did, would there be any responsibility of other people in government to report that fact?    Mr. Buck. But you can see clearly on the email account where it's coming from.    Mr. Buck. You can see that it's not coming from a government agency.    Mr. Buck. Coming from a Yahoo account or----    Mr. Buck . Coming from some other kind of account.    Mr. Buck. OK.    So, just hypothetically, if a Secretary of State, for example, were using a private email account and sent out emails to individuals--other individuals in government, those individuals would know that that Cabinet-level official was using a private email account.    Mr. Buck. And at least as it pertains to other Cabinet-level officials, those folks would know that the President had issued a directive that would have told others not to use private email accounts.    Mr. Buck. And, certainly, Cabinet-level officials know it.    Mr. Buck. And do people in government get training on what is right and what is wrong as it pertains to either ethics or the use of private emails and other appropriate uses of----    Mr. Buck . Resources?    Mr. Buck. OK.    I yield back. Thank you.
