    Mr. Mica. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Throckmorton, there is no generic available for competition to the EpiPen, or is there?    Mr. Mica. Do you have under consideration, I guess it would be public knowledge, anyone producing, attempting to produce generic competition?    Mr. Mica. You would have to approve them. Do you have any being considered for approval now?    Mr. Mica. No, but do you have applications now?    Mr. Mica. How long have you had the applications?    Mr. Mica. You can't tell us.    Mr. Mica. Because we need to know. I mean, one way to bring the price down is to have competition. Wouldn't that be correct?    Mr. Mica. Can you let the committee know for the record how many applications you have--you don't even have to tell us the name--and how long you've had them and how long you've been processing?    Mr. Mica. I can't--that's not acceptable, to come here on this subject and not have that answer.    So the pen is available, and I understand under the Affordable Care Act there is some exceptions to that. Is that correct?    Mr. Mica. Under the Affordable Care Act, is the EpiPen available?    Mr. Mica. How long would it take to get a generic approved and on the market?    Mr. Mica. I want to know how long you've had any applications. You can't tell me----    Mr. Mica. Thank you.    Ms. Bresch, in a media interview, you said: ``As the health insurance environment has evolved, driven by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, patients and families enrolled in high-deductible health insurance plans, who are uninsured, or who pay cash at the pharmacy, have faced higher costs for their medicine.''    Is that correct?    Mr. Mica. And the chairman talked and the staff had talked about the ingredients cost about a dollar. Is that correct?    Mr. Mica. $69.    Mr. Mica. For two. Is this your major profit center for the company?    Mr. Mica. Is this your major profit center?    Mr. Mica. Is it your major profit center?    Mr. Mica. It's your major profit center.    Mr. Mica. And one of the things that concerns us, some people can't get this for their family, their kids, the prices are high. There isn't competition, and then it's also reported that the top five executives within your company earned a collective $292 million from 2011 to 2015. Is that correct?    Mr. Mica. Is that correct?    Mr. Mica. Okay. Well, what's your salary, what was your salary last year?    Mr. Mica. About $18 million. Sounds like you're doing pretty well on this.    How does your compensation compare to peers in the industry?    Mr. Mica. It's in the middle. So there are some with even bigger salaries?    Mr. Mica. Okay. Were your payments or executive compensation packages tied to the result of EpiPen sales?    Mr. Mica. My time is up, but I have other questions I'll submit to the witness.
