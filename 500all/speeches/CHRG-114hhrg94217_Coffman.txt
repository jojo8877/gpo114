    Mr. Coffman. No, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Okay.    Thank you, all, for your patience. A vote came just in time.    And so we appreciate both of you and the challenges that you face in sorting through a very difficult, messy situation in the Central Command area of responsibility.    Thank you again for being here today, and we will look forward to further discussions.    With that, the hearing stands adjourned.
