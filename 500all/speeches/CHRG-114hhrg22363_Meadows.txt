    Mr. Meadows. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Seymour, let me come to you, because there seems to be some conflicting information. Before this committee, on April the 22nd, you had indicated that it was the adversary's modern technology and the OPM's antiquated system that helped thwart--in your words--thwart hackers at the first OPM attack. Is that correct?    Mr. Meadows. Okay.    Last week, you testified repeatedly that it was the OPM's antiquated systems that were the problem and the chief reason that the system was not secure and you didn't do just the basic cybersecurity measures of encryption and network protection.    So, I guess, my question to you, Ms. Seymour: Which is it? Is it the fact that the old system helped you or the old system hurt you? Those are two conflicting pieces of testimony.    Mr. Meadows. So you caught them immediately is what you are saying?    Mr. Meadows. Well----    Mr. Meadows. Okay.    Mr. Meadows. Well, you say you didn't wait once you found the problem, but is there----    Mr. Meadows. Hold on.    Mr. Meadows. Let me ask the question. Is there, in the security IT/cybersecurity technology chief operators, is there anyone who would apply for a job who would suggest not to do encryption of sensitive data?    Mr. Meadows. I didn't ask that. Is there anybody in your job or a similar job who would come in and say, ``We are going to protect everything; let's leave it unencrypted''? Can you think of anyone? Because I have been asking all over the United States. I can't find anybody.    Mr. Meadows. So you are saying that this was a volume problem, not a management problem.    Mr. Meadows. Because you are under oath----    Mr. Meadows. --and that is concerning, because you are saying that you just didn't have the resources to handle the large volume of information?    Mr. Meadows. So they are not encrypted today.    Mr. Meadows. So they are not encrypted today?    Mr. Meadows. I agree, we need to focus on the----    Mr. Meadows. --sensitive information.    So what do we tell the millions and millions of Federal workers, that now, because their system has been breached, now you are going to encrypt it? Do you feel like you have done your job?    Mr. Meadows. Well----    Mr. Meadows. Okay. Well, both of you all came in----    Mr. Meadows. --in 2013. You both came in in 2013.    Mr. Meadows. How long did it take you to buy equipment to start encrypting?    Mr. Meadows. Simple answer.    Mr. Meadows. All right. So you bought equipment in June of 2014.    Mr. Meadows. So when did you start encrypting?    Mr. Meadows. A couple out of how many?    Mr. Meadows. Well, and that is my point.    Mr. Meadows. All right.    Ms. Archuleta, let me come to you. When you applied for the job and you were going through your Senate confirmation, you said that you would make IT, technology your number-one priority. Again, in this committee, you said that it was your number-one priority.    Can you explain to the Federal workers and all those that have had their personal information breached how making it your number-one priority when you were confirmed in 2013 is still to be believed? Or was it just what you said during a confirmation hearing and you really never intended to act on it?    Mr. Meadows. All right.    Mr. Meadows. I appreciate that.    And I appreciate the patience of the chair.
