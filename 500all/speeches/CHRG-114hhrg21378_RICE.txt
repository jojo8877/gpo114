    Mr. RICE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Could you put the slide back up with the surplus that we have right now?    Everybody agrees that that surplus over time will expire unless we do something. Is that correct, sir?    Mr. RICE. And those reserves will be gone in what year?    Mr. RICE. And that is not long-term solvency, is it? The year 2034 is 17 years away.    Mr. RICE. And for many people who are currently already retired or certainly approaching retirement, it will have a dramatic effect on their retirement income, correct?    Mr. RICE. How would you define long-term solvency? How long do you think we should be planning in advance for expiration of these reserves? What would be a comfortable margin for you?    Mr. RICE. So you don't look for something that will be maintained for 75 years or 50 years, those aren't objectives for you?    Mr. RICE. And right now you are saying we are solvent for the next 17 years, but we are not solvent after that?    Mr. RICE. Okay. And the problem is this demographic wave that we face, correct?    Mr. RICE. When will that wave recede? It is not forever. It is not eternal. Do you have any projections on when that wave will recede?    Mr. RICE. And they are continuing to drop. So you don't see this wave receding within the 75-year window?    Mr. RICE. Okay. Thank you. I just have very limited time. I hate to rush you, and I am sorry.    What specific proposals has the Administration made to give solvency to the Social Security trust fund for the next 75 years?    Mr. RICE. Well, what specific proposals has the President made?    Mr. RICE. So that is chained-CPI you are talking about?    Mr. RICE. That was a specific proposal. What other specific proposals has he made?    Mr. RICE. Comprehensive immigration. That doesn't really deal directly with Social Security, that deals with immigration.    Mr. RICE. So the only proposal he has made is to cut the cost-of-living adjustment? That is it?    Let me ask you this. How long would that make the Social Security trust funds solvent? How many years would that add? I know you have run those numbers. How many years would that add?    Mr. RICE. Two or 3 or 4. So instead of it being 16 years from now that the trust funds go broke, we are talking about 20. That is not exactly long-term solvency of the program, is it?    Mr. RICE. But we haven't seen any proposals from the Administration other than that one of cutting the cost-of-living adjustment? Is that right?    Mr. RICE. Okay. All right. What would you suggest, do you have any suggestions for us on how we fix this? I mean, it gets more expensive every year to fix it, correct? What suggestions do you have? I mean, you have limited options, because you have revenues decreasing and you have expenses increasing, and the expenses are going to pass the revenues by 2020, right?    So you really have limited options. You either have to increase revenue or you have to decrease expense, right? So what would you suggest? What specific ways would you suggest to fix Social Security, besides the chained-CPI?    Mr. RICE. Yeah, but you are an actuary. You can do this on the back of your hand.    Have you seen the AARP marketing about tell the Presidential candidates to take a stand? Have you seen that?    Mr. RICE. It has been on TV a lot. It says tell the candidates to take a stand.    I want to know what specific proposals you would make for long-term solvency, solvency for 75 years.    Mr. RICE. Seventy-five-year solvency.    Mr. RICE. Okay. See, my friend, here is what I think the American people are upset about: We keep telling them what the problem is, but we are not offering solutions for them. The Administration has offered one, and that is cut the COLA. I am asking you for solutions.    Mr. RICE. You guys are waist deep in the swamp. You know this better than anybody else.    Mr. RICE. Thank you, sir. Thank you.
