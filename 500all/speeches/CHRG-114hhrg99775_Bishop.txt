    Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your attention to this matter, bringing this before the Committee, and thank you to the panel for being here today and providing your testimony.    Mr. Brady, I was interested in hearing all of this testimony. It is amazing to me what is going on here and how pervasive it is across the government and the economy. We hear the same concern in just about every section of the economy that is regulated by the Federal government.    Your testimony highlights some of the safety concerns that engineering controls create, such as water sprays on a tile roof. It seems to me that we might be solving a problem and creating another. Can you explain how the final rule fails to adequately address the safety concerns?    Mr. Bishop. Maybe it is just me, but that seems like a pretty obvious problem. Was that ever taken into consideration?    Mr. Bishop. Okay. Thank you very much. So many questions. Ms. Herschkowitz, I noted your discussion about the respirator and some of the protective equipment that is out there. Has the quality of that equipment changed over the years? I know this rule has been kind of lingering since, what, 1990. Has it changed over the past couple of decades?    Mr. Bishop. I would assume that the current respirators are far better at doing what they are supposed to do than the previous iterations.    Mr. Bishop. Okay, great. Mr. Chajet, did I pronounce that right?    Mr. Bishop. Thank you. We were just talking about personal protective equipment. OSHA seems to dismiss the use of personal protective equipment as an effective way to protect employees from silica exposure. Is that true? Can you share with me your thoughts on that?    Mr. Bishop. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
