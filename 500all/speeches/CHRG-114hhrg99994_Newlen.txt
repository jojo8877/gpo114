    Mr. Newlen. Go ahead.    Mr. Newlen. I think Dr. Mazanec covered the concerns that Congress needs to think about. You hit the nail on the head in terms of options. That is making the least impact on CRS analysts and any kind of outside pressure that they might experience. You suggested that the House would work with CRS.    I think these are all options worth exploring, we should outline those options that are most cost efficient, have the least impact on CRS, and provide you with the kind of information and analysis that you need.    Mr. Newlen. Mr. Chairman, could I just make one remark.    Mr. Newlen. I just wanted to thank Ms. Wasserman Schultz for bringing up the Rosa Parks Collection today, because this is just a recent example of what our talented and dedicated staff do so well: acquire, preserve, and make accessible rare and unique material. And this is a wonderful, wonderful example of that.    Mr. Newlen. Exactly. So thank you for bringing it up.
