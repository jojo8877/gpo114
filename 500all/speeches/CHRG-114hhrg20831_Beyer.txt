    Mr. Beyer. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    I'd like to begin by thanking the Chairman and the Ranking Member for having this hearing. This is great fun. I love this job just for what we get to learn, and I'd like to welcome the students from Oakton High School from northern Virginia. Welcome. It's great to have you guys here.    I feel like I'm in Bern, Switzerland, in 1905 or the United States in July 1969. This is just so exciting. And I have some---forgive me--nerd questions for you guys, and I'm not quite sure who to send them to.    So we have the strong nuclear force with the glue on and you have electromagnetic force with the photon and the gravitation force is supposed to have the graviton, gravitational waves and graviton wave particle, so tell us about the graviton.    Mr. Beyer. Will you be able to find something like the photoelectric effect with the gravitons?    Mr. Beyer. Okay.    Mr. Beyer. Okay.    Mr. Beyer. Does the gravitational waves go at the speed of light?    Mr. Beyer. So we didn't know that these black holes existed or were about to collide until we saw the gravitational waves from then, and imputed that backwards?    Mr. Beyer. Very cool. So Einstein spent most of his life hating quantum mechanics and trying to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity, reconciling gravitation force with the electromagnetic and the strong force. Does this help?    Mr. Beyer. But will--Dr. Crim, will the reconciliation between quantum mechanics and general relativity come about?    Mr. Beyer. The cosmologists try to look as far in time in possible and, you know, we have that initial thousandths or millionths of a second that we can't see. Does gravitational waves help us to get back to there?    Mr. Beyer. Dr. Reitze, one last question. String theory, yes or no?
