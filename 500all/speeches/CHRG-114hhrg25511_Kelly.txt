    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to address two issues affecting the ability of the FDIC to keep the financial system safe.    First I'd like to ask about the FDIC's orderly liquidation authority. The Dodd-Frank Act permits large and complex financial institutions that are failing to be resolved through a process known as ``orderly liquidation.'' Mr. Chairman, can you please explain what that is and how is it different than bankruptcy    Ms. Kelly. If another financial crisis were to occur today, we hope not, could a failing financial institution be resolved through bankruptcy?    Ms. Kelly. Professor Johnson, do you agree with that? Is bankruptcy a feasible way to resolve a failing institution at this point?    Ms. Kelly. Our chair of Financial Services has recently proposed legislation to rescind the FDIC's orderly liquidation authority.    Professor Johnson, are you familiar with that?    Ms. Kelly. And what would be the effects?    Ms. Kelly. The chairman also has the CHOICE Act, which will require FDIC to calculate and weigh the costs and benefits of new regulations.    Professor Johnson, again, in the financial services arena, how credible are quantitative cost benefit analysis?    Ms. Kelly. Thank you. Chairman, I won't you to ask you to comment on that, but can you tell us if the FDIC currently conduct any analysis of proposed regulations, benefits, and costs?    Ms. Kelly. From a nuts-and-bolts perspective, how would a quantitative cost benefit analysis affect the FDIC's ability to put forward new rules, especially in the midst of a financial crisis?    Ms. Kelly. Yes, sir.    Ms. Kelly. I was wondering. Okay. Thank you
