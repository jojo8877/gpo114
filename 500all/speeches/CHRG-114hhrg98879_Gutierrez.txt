    Mr. Gutierrez. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. I appreciate the gentleman from Missouri yielding to me. And welcome, Mr. Weiss.    I just want to use this intervention to say that we have talked about fiscal mismanagement in Puerto Rico. You have talked about transparency in the budget. You said that promises need to be kept, reduce spending, and pay its obligations.    Where are the jobs? Where is the economic opportunity? Where is the possibility for the people of Puerto Rico? And I would simply suggest with the 50 seconds that I have that one of the things that was recommended is that--you said it, Mr. Weiss--visit, talk. You said you have been down there. When are we going to go down and listen to the people of Puerto Rico, and have a hearing there, front and center, so that we can hear what their dreams and aspirations are, so that we can see their lives?    It is good to go down to Puerto Rico to fill our campaign coffers and war chests, but we should also go to Puerto Rico not simply for partisan political reasons, to fill our campaign coffers, but we should go down there to fill our minds with their ideas, their aspirations, and their dreams. Because otherwise, I would suggest, Mr. Chairman--and I thank you--these hearings are simply seen as a way to humiliate the people of Puerto Rico, instead of lift them.    The Chairman. First, you came in late--I am going to give you a chance to catch your--let me go back to Mr. Labrador, you have been sitting here in No Man's Land again--and give you a chance to ask questions. Then we will catch up with some of the others who have been here.
