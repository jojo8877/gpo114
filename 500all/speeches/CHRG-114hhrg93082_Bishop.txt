    Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would like to take a moment to thank everybody that has come today. My heart goes to all of you for what you have been through, and I hope that this hearing is a reflection of the fact that inasmuch as it looks like there is some infighting here, that there is a true effort to try and make the system better and address some concerns. And I, for one, am grateful for you being here today. I am grateful for the panel to be here today to share their experience as well.    Mr. Vari, I have heard varying degrees of testimony today with regard to double dipping, and I am wondering if you might be able to--I have heard that it does not exist. I have heard that it does exist. I assume that it is somewhere in the middle, but if you could share with me your experience.    Mr. Bishop. Thank you very much. I also have a question for Mr. Scarcella. Sir, I appreciate your testimony, and wonder if you might expound a little bit on the portion of your testimony where you talked about the discrepancy between disclosures made in State court and the asbestos bankruptcy system. It is a lot of nuance, and I am wondering if you can share with me the difference between the two systems.    Mr. Bishop. Either, or, whatever. I know both of you have ample knowledge in this area. It was to you, sir, but either one would be fine.    Mr. Bishop. Yes, sir, thank you.    Mr. Bishop. Thank you, sir. I yield back my time.
