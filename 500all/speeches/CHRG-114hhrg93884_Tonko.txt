    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Madam Chair.    The traffic to the federal government health insurance website was up 58 percent compared to the same time last week in a week-to-week measurement. That was some 275,000 individuals that signed up, making it the busiest enrollment period of the past two months, and the comparisons from last year to this year are ``as an experience, pretty dramatic.'' What is your reaction to that?    Mr. Tonko. Does it indicate any sort of comfort zone with the website?    Mr. Tonko. Um-hum. And it seems like over the past 10, 20 years the expectations of privacy have diminished dramatically. Do you think that that is true and what can we do to ensure that private personal data stay private?    Mr. Tonko. Um-hum.    Mr. Tonko. Ms. De Mooy, one of your recommendations that would address the wider problems beyond HealthCare.gov was to strengthen legal incentives for companies to better safeguard data. Can you speak more directly to this and what it would look like and why it is necessary?    Mr. Tonko. And are there steps that you believe can be taken by private industry or commercial companies, internet providers to help limit the amount of personal data these enterprises collect?    Mr. Tonko. Um-hum. Is there a point where that could become unrealistic?    Mr. Tonko. Um-hum.
