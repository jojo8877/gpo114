    Mr. Brady. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Thank you for holding this meeting. I have a longer statement for the record, but want to underline the important work this Committee does in making sure public funds and other official resources are used properly. I would also like to commend Ms. Lofgren and Mr. Davis for taking the lead on behalf of the Committee on this project.    I very much appreciate the work of the bipartisan staff that has happened here. Their work has produced some overdue changes to our regulations and will give the taxpayers greater transparency on how our tax dollars are spent.    Madam Chairman, I would like to submit my full statement for the record, and thank you again for having this meeting.    Mr. Brady. No.    The Chairman. All right.    Would any member like to offer an amendment to this resolution?    Mr. Brady. Yes.    The Clerk. Mr. Brady votes yes.    Ms. Lofgren?
