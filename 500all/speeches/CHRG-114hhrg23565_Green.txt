    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank you and the ranking member for the service that you are rendering in hosting these hearings. I would also like to thank the witnesses for appearing today, and make one observation. Looking at and judging your body language, you are all very resolute. You really have come to conclusions that you absolutely believe in. So I want to just compliment you on being so strong-willed, if you will, with reference to what you said.    Now, I will tell you, when I heard $972 for a plastic bucket, that got my attention. My question to you, sir, is, is this commonplace or a rarity? Because I understand what you mean about the value of transfer. How frequent do we have these occurrences of buckets, or a cattle for $20. You did say cattle for $20.    I am from Texas. From time to time, I wear a big hat. But I have no cattle. In Texas, that means you are really not very much of a cowboy or rancher. But when you tell me that you are selling cattle for $20, even I understand that there is a problem.    How is it that you are able to acquire this intelligence? And I am not sure whether you are implying in some way that others know about it, but they are not acting on it.    Mr. Green. If you can do it really briefly, I probably spoke too long myself. But I had to get that point out. I want to hear some others.    Mr. Green. Let me ask, as we go to another area quickly, would legalizing drugs have a positive or a negative impact on this illicit trade? Yes, sir?    Mr. Green. Let me get one more question in, please. If we do some of the things that I contemplate doing, my suspicion is that we will have some legitimate business persons who will give a little bit of pushback. I am being a bit euphemistic with my terminology. What would you say to the legitimate business people who will voice their concerns in a legitimate way?    Mr. Green. Can Mr. Cassara respond? I see that he wants to, Mr. Chairman.
