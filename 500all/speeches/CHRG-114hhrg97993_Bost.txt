    Mr. Bost. I will yield.    Mr. Bost. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I sit here quietly, and I have tried as a state legislator to help, as was spoken a while ago, our veterans. And when you see the amount of bureaucracy they have to deal with, and I understand as I listened to everyone that we are trying to reduce and get that opportunity so they can receive benefits quicker.    Just listening from this panel, and that is why I passed, Mr. Chairman, on asking a while ago, we can't even figure out what the amount of, level of bureaucracy that we have to climb through, through your agency as elected officials. How devastating is that to our veterans as they try to move through this process? I see that you are trying, and I am glad to hear on the computer system and that we are trying to update that.    Is it our fault as Congress over the years that we created this, in your opinion? Or is it the fault of the agency in the case that they themselves have created intergovernmental rules that make it so difficult? I know we, you know, are going to try to answer, ask questions that go on the record, but this is the type things that my constituents want to know.    How do we straighten it out? How do we lighten it up? These people have served us. They have claims. They need the process to move fairly quickly, and we are talking three years, five years, ten years. You work with it every day. How do we lighten it up, speed it up, and how do we work with you to achieve that?    Mr. Bost. Thank you.
