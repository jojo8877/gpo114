    Mr.  Green. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    And I thank the witnesses.    And, of course, I always thank the ranking member for her leadership on these issues.    I lived through Katrina. And it is inappropriate to say I lived through it because I wasn't actually there--    Mr.  Green. Excuse me. This may be the President calling.    I wasn't actually there.    It is not the President. Okay. So, I won't take the call.    I wasn't actually there. But I arrived shortly thereafter, and I saw the tragedy that was left behind. I went to Sri Lanka after the tsunami. I was in the Philippines after Haiyan. And I know what this looks like, the aftermath, and it is not a pleasant sight, to say the very least. And I am being quite euphemistic.    Here is the question that I have for you, dear friends: Are you indicating that, if we had this system in place pursuant to H.R. 2901, that we would not have expended the billions of dollars that we had to expend after Katrina, that this would eliminate the necessity for the Federal Government to step in? This is an important question for me and my constituents.    Yes, sir, if you would?    Mr.  Green. On the question of the billions that we currently find ourselves indebted to, I suppose the Treasury, would we still have that $23 billion debt if we had H.R. 2901 in place?    Mr.  Green. Thank you.    I will yield back the balance of my time.
