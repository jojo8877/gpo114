    Ms. Matsui. Thank you very much, my fellow colleague. Got the wrong thing here. In 2012, with strong bipartisan congressional backing, the Administration's position was strengthened in re-affirming the current multi-stakeholder approach that has allowed the Internet to flourish here in the United States and around the world. Congress must stay united moving forward. I am pleased to hear that the Administration will not support any proposal that undermines the openness of the Internet. With over two billion users, we all know the Internet has become a necessity, and not a luxury. It plays a dominant role in the world economy. We need to continue to promote innovation and openness of the Internet around the globe. That has been the hallmark of U.S. policy. I believe the multi-stakeholder approach must continue to define Internet governance, and I yield back the balance of my time.
