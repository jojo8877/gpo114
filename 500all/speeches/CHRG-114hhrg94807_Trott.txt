    Mr. Trott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to thank all the witnesses today for being here.    And Commissioner Magee, a couple questions. So you opposed H.R. 2315, correct?    Mr. Trott. The model would be, in your mind, a national solution, though. Correct?    Mr. Trott. What happens if a state doesn't adopt the model? You are looking to Congress to adopt the model in lieu of state solutions. Correct?    Mr. Trott. So states have been known to tweak the models. So what happens then in terms of the simplification?    Mr. Trott. But you would agree, though, if we are going to do a model that is going to be adopted by 50 states, we are not going to end up with a simplification. I mean isn't that a fairly logical assumption given how states tend to enact legislation?    Mr. Trott. So you know you say 50 W-2s is extraordinary. I had businesses where we routinely had 20 or 30. So 50 may be extreme but I mean 20 or 30 is still a burden for folks, wouldn't you agree?    Mr. Trott. Still, 50 different states.    Next question, though. One of the concerns you have with H.R. 2315 is the voluntary recordkeeping. I wonder if you could speak to that and I wonder if you could explain how the recordkeeping would differ under the model that you advocate?    Mr. Trott. But because of that, the employer is still going to have some of the same problems they have today under the model. Is that a fair statement?    Mr. Trott. We had several people here today complaining about it. I mean maybe they haven't gotten your address in Alabama but we have people here today complaining about it.    Mr. Trott. Yes and unfortunately the electronic world hasn't eased the regulatory burden on businesses. But thank you for your comments.    I yield back.
