    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And just in reference to statements made earlier by a member of our committee concerning several senior-level administrators leaving under the guise of the challenges of doing the job here, remember some of those left under a rather dark cloud pleading the 5th under potential impeachment, et cetera. So we do not need to forget that also.    Mr. Milholland, you mentioned that when finding out that your direct orders for preservation were disregarded, you were blown away. Coming from your experience in the private sector, extensive experience and background in the private sector, I would assume that orders like that would not have been disregarded clearly without significant consequence. So I do want to go back to a question made by a colleague of mine, Mr. Jordan, and just get a more direct answer. Do you know of anyone who was reprimanded for not following the preservation notice? Reprimanded or worse.    Mr. Walberg. But the leadership team, any one reprimanded?    Mr. Walberg. But no other consequences beyond that.    Mr. Walberg. I doubt that in the private sector it would have been as simple as that. Let me move on. Let me move on. The taxpayer advocate recently released a report on the IRS future state plan that stated the IRS's intent to move all taxpayer filing and help systems to an online platform.    In the last 9 months, the IRS has experienced at least two electronic data breaches surrounding taxpayer P-2s. This includes the May 2015 breach that exposed more than 100,000 taxpayers' sensitive information. The taxpayer advocate also found that roughly 1 in 5 taxpayers who were victims of taxpayer identity theft had their IRS files closed. Despite unresolved issues remaining, taxpayers, in other words, still had to wait an average of 6 months before the negative impact of taxpayer identity theft was addressed.    Mr. Tribiano, in light of these breaches, why does IRS feel that now is the best time to roll out a more expansive and pervasive online tax system?    Mr. Walberg. How do you propose to protect them, though, online?    Mr. Walberg. Walk me through that, some of the means by which you can stop the breaches that could very clearly come that has taken place in person, but it could take place extensively online.    Mr. Walberg. I appreciate this getting on record of what you are doing, and that down the road we will not be blown away by mistakes that come, but I want to make sure that this is taken care of. That is part of our oversight, and we want to make sure that you are doing oversight as well. I yield back.
