    Mr. Beyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Weiss.    Representative Pierluisi spoke eloquently of the disparate treatment that Puerto Ricans have now under Federal law. And you talked about the oversight board, the fiscal restructuring. Can long-term fiscal stability come to Puerto Rico without addressing Medicare, Medicaid, EITC, and other stuff?    Mr. Beyer. I am told that, without really even looking at Medicare, you are going to be permanently structurally imbalanced for the long term, putting Puerto Rico back in the same position.    Mr. Beyer. You talked about $70 billion in debt, the declining population, and an aging population--2\1/2\ percent lost just last year. Is there any possible way to support $70 billion, even restructure, without significant haircuts to existing bondholders?    Mr. Beyer. So, it is imperative that some of the existing debt be written off in order to get it to a balanced----    Mr. Beyer. Yes. You talked about the oversight board, but also maintaining the local government autonomy. Can you talk about the dangers when there is not local government autonomy? And all of us are painfully aware of what happened in Flint recently, so----    Mr. Beyer. One question has been brought up a number of times, especially by my friends in the Majority, that the prospect of Puerto Rico really re-entering the bond market in a meaningful way after the write-offs, after whatever--if not Chapter 9, some type of fiscal restructuring. Are there examples in the past, other places, of successfully re-entering the credit markets after a restructuring?    Mr. Beyer. Thank you. Mr. Chair, I yield back.    The Chairman. Thank you.    Mr. Westerman.
