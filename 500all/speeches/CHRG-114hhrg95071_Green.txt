    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And I thank the witnesses for appearing as well.    And, Mr. Chairman, I am very much concerned about the notion that we should follow the money, but I am also concerned about following the counterfeit money, what is called ``supernotes.''    This currency is so finely tuned that sometimes it is very difficult to be detected but for some sort of special technology. As you know, the dollar is the reserve currency for most of the world, and there is a war for currency supremacy.    My concern--or maybe I shouldn't be concerned, and I will let you tell me--is whether or not these supernotes flowing in and out of our country and into other countries can pose some sort of threat to security in this country in the long run.    I do understand that we retooled our currency, but I am still concerned about nationals larger than terrorist organizations, countries, if you will, that can play a role in devaluing and creating mistrust in our currency.    Does anyone care to respond?    Mr. Green. Mr. Asher, if I may, I appreciate your answer. I do want to interrupt for this reason. I have one other question for you. This one relates to knockoffs. I want to move to a more pedestrian level now, if I may.    Knockoffs: we see a lot of it on the streets. And the question is, to what extent are these knockoffs related to either networks of criminal activity--not just as individuals, but networks--and, also, the possibility of being linked to terrorism? You talked about cars.    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the time. I yield back.
