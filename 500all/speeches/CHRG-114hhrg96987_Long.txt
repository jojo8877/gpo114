    Mr. Long. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And K-e-h-l, how do I pronounce that?    Mr. Long. Kehl, OK. That is what I thought it was. OK. I thought I heard that earlier, but I don't always hear things correctly. But, Ms. Kehl, what if the transition doesn't go through? What is the downside?    Mr. Long. Say that again, now, on that last part? It is unlikely that what happened?    Mr. Long. As they say, there is many a slip between the cup and the lip, so during this handoff, there is some chances of some pretty bad things happening also?    Mr. Long. Anyone want to dispute what she said? I saw a lot of heads nodding in agreement. Anybody dispute what--yes, sir, Mr. Shears.    Mr. Long. Mr. Schaefer?    Mr. Long. Well, shouldn't .mil, .gov, shouldn't those be exclusive, perpetual, and at no cost? Are we going to be able to do that?    Mr. Long. You believe what now?    Mr. Long. Yes, I heard what Mr. DelBianco said earlier, but I just wanted to kind of figure out how to tie it into what you were saying. So, with that, I don't have any time to yield back, but if I did, I would.
