    Mrs. Torres. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning. My questions are around the board, and in the specific bill, I think that we are pretty prescriptive as to who appoints the seven-member board. However, it lacks the same type of prescriptive way of who actually can be appointed.    While the bill states that individuals must have knowledge and expertise in finance, municipal bond markets, management, law, or organization, or operation of business or government, seven board members could come from any one of those subgroups, but not all, correct?    Mr. Weiss, I apologize if I put you on the spot there.    Mrs. Torres. I understand the conflict of interest. However, my concern is still that all seven members could come from any one of those specific backgrounds, and I think that the board should be a diverse board that represents the interests that are being proposed here or talked about here, not just with financial interest but also that look like the people of Puerto Rico.    Mrs. Torres. In the early 1980s, as a young 16-year-old, I started my first job earning minimum wage. Back then, it was $3.35. Fast forward 35 years, we are asking 25-year-olds and under in Puerto Rico to live within about 90 cents higher than the minimum wage of early 1980s. How is that not going to negatively impact the workforce of Puerto Rico? And is this going to create a two-class type of employee where the older employees may be the first ones to be laid off or fired under this restructuring of wages?    Mrs. Torres. These are the two issues that I am very concerned about, and I don't believe that today I have heard an answer that has satisfied my concern.    Thank you, and I yield back my time.    The Chairman. Mr. Benishek.
