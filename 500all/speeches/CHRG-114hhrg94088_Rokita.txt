    Ms. Rokita. I thank the Chairman. I thank the witnesses for their testimony and their leadership on this issue. It is really appreciated.    I want to focus some of my questions around the bureaucracy, maybe in these programs generally and what you do and maybe even if you see some waste, fraud and abuse.    But, Mr. Storen, starting with you, you mentioned bureaucratic inefficiency in your testimony. Can you give me some specific examples?    Ms. Rokita. Is your mike on? Are these mikes on?    Ms. Rokita. But, Mr. Chairman, they are run by the same--it is the USDA in both cases in your example, right?    Ms. Rokita. Thank you, Mr. Storen.    My time is limited so let me go on to Ms. Bauscher. Thank you, again, for your leadership.    Obvious constitutional issues aside for a second, one of our duties is to ensure the programs we are authorizing are actually running effectively and in accordance with the law. You mentioned cost, I believe, in your testimony, especially with the new regulations. But do you see or do your members see any pattern, waste or fraud going on or abuse of any kind in these programs?    Ms. Rokita. Are you looking for it?    Ms. Rokita. How?    Ms. Rokita. Are all the sign ups legitimate? Is the eligibility`--    Ms. Rokita. How?    Ms. Rokita. What does that mean?    Ms. Bauscher.--which means that they are receiving certain other types of federal assistance, including Medicaid, some forms of Medicaid we can automatically, categorically qualify the students in the household for free meals, and that decreases the errors.    Ms. Rokita. In that situation, the school would be out of the business of pushing the application out to the parents or whatever. You drill into a database of some sort--    Ms. Rokita. Oh, so the school is still pushing applications?    Ms. Rokita. Thank you--    Ms. Rokita. Do you think that is a good policy?    Ms. Rokita. Why?    Ms. Rokita. I am out of time. Thank you.
