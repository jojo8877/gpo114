    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Lidback, in your testimony you mentioned that the marketplace is already sorting out some of the non-GMO labeling without legislative mandates. I wanted to just get your feeling and your perception and that of your peers I suppose on the Whole Foods discussion, that in 2018 they plan to have all their products in the United States and in Canada labeled.    Can you give the Committee your views on these kind of private-sector driven initiatives?    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you. I appreciate the answer.    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you. Mr. Policinski and maybe Mr. Clarkson can also handle this next one. Sir, you mentioned earlier that there are some industry components. What I heard you say was there are some industry components within possible legislation that you could support, such as the definition of natural, you mentioned, in addition to the voluntary labeling that we have heard extensively. What are some other policy components that you feel industry can get behind showing consumers as you mentioned more about where their food comes from?    Mr. Aguilar. Sure, but one of the panelists just said that it was deceptive. So you are saying that we might gravitate toward that, but one of the panelists just mentioned that those efforts were deceptive.    Mr. Aguilar. Right.    Mr. Aguilar. Mr. Clarkson, do you want the last comment?    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you so much. Thank you for your answers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Mr. Allen from Georgia.
