    Mr. Davis. Thank you, Madam Chairman.    Thank you to Ranking Member Brady and this entire Committee.    As somebody who used to actually file the vouchers as a member of the congressional staff for one of our colleagues, these updates I think are overdue, and I think they are going to go a long way in ensuring that the House processes more closely resemble documentation standards in the private sector.    So thank you all for your assistance. I would like to especially thank Ms. Lofgren for helping us go through this process just a few short months ago.    I yield back.    The Chairman. I certainly want to thank both Mr. Davis and Ms. Lofgren for all of the work that they did on this. It was many, many hours, and I think the institution will be so much better for it.    I recognize the gentlelady.
