    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Madam Chair.    This hearing shines a light on a difficult but indeed important issue and I appreciate my colleagues' focus on the ethical and legal issues surrounding this new technology.    I'm also assured to see that experts in the medical and scientific community are coming together to debate this issue and to discuss potential policy implications. However, as we explore the boundaries of what science is capable of and what is ethical and what should be legal, we should also take a moment to appreciate just how remarkable these advances are. We recognize that these new gene editing technologies, including CRISPR, are the outgrowth of decades of fundamental research supported by federal agencies, including the National Science Foundation.    So to Dr. Doudna and Dr. McNally, could you please speak to the importance of federal investments in fundamental research, especially the need to support research that may not have any known commercial application at the time?    Mr. Tonko. Well, the Reader's Digest version.    Mr. Tonko. Dr. Dzau, I think you wanted to respond to that, too?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you.    Dr. McNally, in your testimony you mentioned how these technologies may be able to be used in somatic or mature cells to treat and potentially cure diseases such as sickle cell anemia and muscular dystrophy. Can you please elaborate on this possibility and what is that range of therapies and cures that we might only imagine?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you so much.    Madam Chair, I yield back.    Chairwoman Comstock. Thank you.    I now recognize Mr. Palmer for five minutes.
