    Mr. Polis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We all know that this is the third hearing we have had regarding the Puerto Rican debt crisis. Frankly, I am disappointed we have not gotten to the point where we can have meaningful discussions about imminent action that needs to occur with regard to the financial crisis occurring every day in Puerto Rico, with over $70 billion in public debt. I think we are obligated to have an open dialogue about the use of Chapter 9 or other innovative options. We need to consider restructuring the debt in a responsible manner for any of these growth scenarios to be able to take hold.    Mr. Weiss, since this is the third hearing on the Puerto Rico debt crisis in our committee, can you speak to the urgency of taking immediate action for the people of Puerto Rico?    Mr. Polis. And speaking of the urgency, whatever the restructuring, the rebuilding, and the recapitalization steps that occur, do they get easier or harder if Congress continues to delay?    Mr. Polis. There is no ability to delay. Thank you.    I want to also talk about a lot of the testimony that was about ideas for growth and how we can grow the Puerto Rican economy. One of the pillars, of course, promotion of economic measures aimed at growth. But the only economic measures specifically I have heard from you relate to the EITC, which you mentioned earlier. There is also the treatment of Medicaid benefits.    I fear that those are far too mild for what we actually need to encourage economic growth in Puerto Rico. Would the Treasury consider exploring additional growth options, like using the tax code to provide incentives for new corporate investments in Puerto Rico? I would certainly be willing to work with you on those kinds of proposals. Are those the kinds of things that you would be open to?    Mr. Polis. I thank you, and I yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Pierluisi from Puerto Rico.
