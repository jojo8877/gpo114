    Mrs. Lummis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to followup on Mr. Lieu's line of questioning.    Mr. Ehrlich, why did you put forth, as part of that late-night motion in California, why did you move to close out pending investigations at Silver Eagle and CITGO and Horsehead?    Mrs. Lummis. Who provided you----    Mrs. Lummis . With that information?    Mrs. Lummis. So the staff told you, ``We're done''?    Mrs. Lummis. So why a late-night motion that wrapped a whole bunch of Board procedures, chairman duties in with this?    Mrs. Lummis. OK.    Mr. Moure-Eraso, did you agree with this, this closing out the pending investigations?    Mrs. Lummis. OK.    So, Mr. Griffon----    Mrs. Lummis . Did you agree?    Mrs. Lummis. I'm sorry. You just said yes. I got my answer.    Mrs. Lummis. Mr. Griffon, did you agree with closing out those investigations?    Mrs. Lummis. So what are the implications of closing these out without the effort to go forward?    Mrs. Lummis. So do you believe these investigations were closed because investigators have left the agency? Or did that have nothing to do with it?    Mrs. Lummis. And do you think that that evidence might have a bearing on public safety, they might inform or instruct public safety in the future?    Mrs. Lummis. Mr. Engler, any idea why this--why eliminate this?    Mrs. Lummis. Yes.    Mrs. Lummis. Yes. I think----    Mrs. Lummis. Yes. We share your frustration.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
