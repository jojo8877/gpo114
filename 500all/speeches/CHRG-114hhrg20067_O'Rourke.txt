    Mr. O'Rourke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, last week, we were able to listen to testimony from Acting Secretary of the Army Murphy and General Milley. And Secretary Murphy said, to continue this line of questioning on risk begun by Mr. Turner, said something to the effect of this budget places the Army at high risk. And prior to that, General Milley had made that connection explicit between risk and the loss of the service members' lives who we will put in harm's way. We reduce risk, we reduce that loss of life. So there couldn't be anything more serious or grave for us to make a decision on.    My question for you is, is that level of risk comparable in the other service branches? And what is your guidance to us as a committee going into the NDAA as a Congress that might look in the near future at supplemental funding to further mitigate that risk in this upcoming budget year?    Mr. O'Rourke. Let me ask two followup questions to clarify. One, are we doing all we can do within this budget request to mitigate that risk? If not, what do we need to do? I would be happy to join my colleagues and you in making the necessary changes too. My understanding is that risk is a term of art in terms of what the service chief submits to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. And what I would like to know, is what we heard from the Acting Secretary and the Chief of Staff of the Army reflected in the other service branches? Yes or no, if we have less risk in those others, are there more resources to pull to address the high risk, which I understand is a term of art, that was disclosed to us in the hearing last week?    Mr. O'Rourke. This is as much as we can do.    Mr. O'Rourke. Thank you. I am out of time.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Mr. Rogers.
