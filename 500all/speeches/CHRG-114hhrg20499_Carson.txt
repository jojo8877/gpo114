    Mr. Carson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to hear from everyone. What are your views regarding an additional physical barricade outside of the cockpit? I have heard proponents point out that this measure could be effective and not especially expensive, but we have also heard objections, as you know.    So, I offered an amendment to add a secondary barrier to all U.S. passenger carriers manufactured going forward. What do you guys think of this idea, or concept?    Mr. Carson. OK.    Mr. Carson. Thank you, thank you. Secondly, how does the explosion of drones into our national airspace factor into air traffic control staffing and management? Some have suggested that the possible use of geofencing or even other techniques to keep airport approaches and takeoffs safe and unimpeded by amateur drone operators--to keep them out of our airspace.    But what is the safety plan to avoid drone accidents that could easily hurt people on the ground, or even interfere with other operations? And won't air traffic controllers be needed to keep drone operations safe? How do you guys see this being factored into our proposal today?    Mr. Carson. Thank you all.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
