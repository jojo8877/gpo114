    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. Thank you all for being here, and I met with a group--a physician group yesterday and they were asking a lot of questions about alternative payment models and so forth, and my point to them was if--you know, if a few dozen people or so sit in Washington, DC in a room and design all of this it's not going to be successful. It's got to be from physicians up--from practitioners moving up so that we can take it into account.    So this panel is important and I appreciate the opportunity to have you guys before us and eagerly look for your input as we move forward because that's how it's going to work.    But we're also eagerly awaiting the proposed rule but I want to know about the proposed rule what are you guys most excited about? I'll just open it to the panel. I'll start to my left and start with Dr. McLean. What are you the most excited about by the opportunities that MACRA offers?    Mr. Guthrie. OK. Do you want to add? That was a pretty comprehensive answer but we'll--go ahead, I'll let you guys----    Mr. Guthrie. OK. So let me ask another question. We'll start with you, Dr. Bailet, and we'll work back the other way this time.    So when we passed MACRA we envisioned it as a means to provide greater flexibility for physicians and not impose new burdens. Can you speak to the current burdens associated with quality programs in your practices and how you believe MACRA can lower the administrative burden while focusing on quality?    Mr. Guthrie. Go ahead.    Mr. Guthrie. Yes, as long as the chair----    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. I do have more questions but I'm out of time so I'll yield back.
