    Mrs. Lummis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for holding this hearing on the safety in offshore energy production. As has been said, this marks the 5-year anniversary this week of the horrific tragedy aboard the offshore oil platform, Deepwater Horizon, where the explosion took 11 lives and devastated families. The ecological damage was extensive. The tragedy was like a shot heard 'round the world, in terms of how we look at offshore energy safety, and rightly so.    Fixing the safety shortfalls that led to the explosion isn't just the right thing to do for those workers, their families, and the environment. It is a necessity, going forward, because offshore energy production is a necessity. Offshore energy production is essential for the United States to achieve lasting energy security, which also brings about economic security, national security, and job security for the men and women in the offshore industry.    So, the answer is not to hold up offshore energy production. The answer is to make offshore energy production safer than it has ever been in history for both the people and the environment. We must proceed deliberately and responsibly toward safety improvements, relying on science, innovation, and measurable results. We need to encourage creativity and innovation that is ingrained in American culture and tradition.    I thank our panels for coming today to discuss strides made both by industry and the regulatory community since Deepwater Horizon occurred. We must make sure the Federal regulatory framework that was developed in response to the tragedy stays nimble and keeps pace with the technological innovation that has occurred since then. Striking this balance between worker and environmental safety and our energy security will be an ongoing challenge, but America is up to the challenge, as I believe today's panel will begin to reveal.    Thank you. Mr. Chairman.
