    Mr. Upton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This hearing does continue the subcommittee's thoughtful and necessary oversight of the President's healthcare law. Today, the three-and-half-billion-dollar question is why CMS is now diverting taxpayer dollars to insurance companies without any legal authority to do so.    Health law statute plainly states that a portion of the contributions to the reinsurance program must be given to the U.S. Treasury. Still, CMS has chosen to violate the law by prioritizing reinsurance contributions to health insurers rather than allocating the required portion to the U.S. Treasury.    Initially, CMS followed the letter of the law and according to its final rule issued on March 11th, 2014, and similar to its rule the prior year, CMS planned to allocate contributions to the reinsurance program between the health insurers, the Treasury, and administrative costs. Less than two weeks later, however, on March 31st, 2014, CMS switched gears and issued a different proposed rule completely reversing their previous position.    Rather than allocating a portion of the contribution to the Treasury as dictated by law, CMS instead prioritized reinsurance contributions to health insurers and finalized the rule two months later. So why, the question is why the sudden reversal to redirect billions away from the taxpayer?    Legal memorandum released earlier this year by the nonpartisan CRS found that the statute does not permit CMS to prioritize reinsurance payments to insurers. In fact, the Congressional Research Service found that CMS' actions appear to contradict the plain language of the law.    I would like to think that you have come to provide us some answers to those questions today as we look to understand the who, what, when, where, and why of that decision. The American public deserves answers and we look forward to that discussion. I yield back.
