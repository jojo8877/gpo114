    Mr. Royce. Thank you, Mr. Salmon.    I think we should start by thanking Cal Poly Pomona for opening up this hall to so many people here today. We had an opportunity not too long ago to have the director of USAID out here in this very hall, and Cal Poly Pomona gave us a forum to talk about the challenges about rebuilding after Tacloban, and specifically about legislation that this committee, my committee had passed that I had authored that allowed aid to go immediately, and food to be purchased locally with respect to our USAID efforts in the Philippines.    But today I am particularly appreciative of my colleagues here from Congress, and the State Department and USAID being here again. Director Shaw I thought did a great job. We had a town hall meeting here last time. This time we are doing this in the form of a hearing in order to get into an issue that I think is very, very important, and that is what can we do to help change this phenomenon of land grabbing and the dislocation of people that are being pushed off of their land by government policy around the world, and specifically some of the new programs that USAID is championing in the Philippines and elsewhere in order to achieve this goal.    I did want to mention my wife Marie used to be a professor here at Cal Poly Pomona, so I have had the opportunity to be up on the campus a number of times for international programs. But in this case, we are looking at how we can best promote not just the rights of people in parts of the Philippines right now where, because of the Marcos legacy, they do not really have a tradition of land title. This was one of the things that President Aquino was trying to change and is trying to change. But locally, as you go into certain parts of the Philippines, Marcos' practices of seizing land and transferring that land into the hands of people who are well connected locally, has created an environment where, you can see by the concern of the community here, you can see that people, frankly, are losing their property.    Land title reform is a big part of the solution here, and that is what we are going to talk about today, and we are going to hear from witnesses.    We had had some successes, but as we aim, frankly, to deepen our engagement in Southeast Asia and transform our aid so that it supports sustainable economic growth, we have got to consider whether the underlying conditions exist to realize that growth. In countries where citizens are denied basic protections under the law, including the right to secure property and the right to basically have title, those conditions don't exist.    So if I could just speak to Cambodia for a minute, Chairman Salmon, over half of land holdings are held informally there, without legal title. It would help enormously if we could put into effect a change that would give land title to those who are farming that land, because as the Cambodian economy has developed, many Cambodians have been displaced by the Hun Sen government. The government and domestic and foreign businesses are responsible for seizing much of this land. The government has appropriated lands and homes forcibly, often for agricultural use or mining or logging.    According to testimony that I am going to submit for the record here, the Cambodian Government of Hun Sen maintains its political and economic power, and I am going to quote Meach Sovannara here, his words. He is a U.S. citizen who is being held in prison right now in Cambodia for speaking out about land reform and other issues like this. I am going to quote him:        ``They maintain economic power through the control and         harsh repression of anyone who stands in the way of         their economic enrichment and political control, and         anyone criticizing their policies and actions.''    His family is with us today, Jamie Meach, who is with us, and her children, their children.    Chairman, could I ask if they could stand in the front row?    Mr. Royce. Jamie, could you and your family stand? I am going to put your husband's statement in the record here today with the support of Chairman Salmon.    Mr. Royce. Thank you.    So he has been imprisoned. We are also going to be talking with the State Department about doing what you can to get those American citizens back who are held overseas because they are speaking out specifically about human dignity and freedom and this issue of land grabbing.    According to the Cambodian League for the Promotion of the Defense of Human Rights, three-fifths of arable land in Cambodia is controlled by foreign agribusiness companies. Foreign investment--it can be beneficial--but it has to be rules based. It has to be above board. These large plantations fail to provide stable employment and adequate income for local residents who formally farm that land.    In some areas of the Philippines, land ownership is informal and narrowly disputed among local elites and clans. Tens of millions of Filipinos work as lease holders or rent-paying sharecroppers. Outdated land administration laws and an inefficient land administration system have resulted in fraudulent, overlapping land titles and widespread land grabbing. The perpetrators are politicians and foreign investors. Besides insecure land rights, over 12 million families in the Philippines do not own the rights to their own homes. So there is a desperate need for proper titling, which would unlock vast wealth for Filipinos, as noted economist Hernando de Soto has testified before our committee.    President Aquino has made considerable efforts to reform and clean up politics in the Philippines, but his few years in office cannot undo the years of damage done by President Marcos and the legacy President Marcos left, especially in some regions in the Philippines.    Last February I led a bipartisan congressional delegation to the Philippines where we were able to observe the destruction done by Typhoon Yolanda. Several members of this committee were there with me, and I appreciate very much, Brad, you and Matt, and all the engagement in the Philippines. I was glad to see such a strong U.S. humanitarian effort. In the aftermath of natural disasters like this, on top of losing their homes, victims can also find themselves without a shred of proof to the rights to their property.    In the Antipolo region, I was personally prevented, at gunpoint--and this was on a trip I took prior to last year. It was 2 years ago. We took a delegation out there. I was prevented, at gunpoint, from accessing the property of a constituent by what appeared to be a member of a local security force. He had closed off the road. He closed off access of a public road to people in that area that owned their property. In my meeting with President Aquino I pressed him on the importance of protecting property rights. Filipinos as well as Cambodians have great economic potential. We should be working to unlock that potential.    President Aquino is working to unlock that potential, but USAID needs to help us find a way at the local level to make sure that local governments do this as well.    Today we will hear from victims of land grabbing. Because property rights are essential to stability and economic growth, we have to do all we can to encourage nations to offer these protections to their citizens. This would dramatically improve the lives of Filipinos, Cambodians and others in Asia, while improving our economic well-being and security.    So again, I thank you, Mr. Salmon, and I thank our ranking member here as well.    Mr. Royce. And that is despite--if the gentleman would yield?    Mr. Royce. That is despite the fact that her husband went to the other campus.    Mr. Royce. Chairman Salmon, let me yield to Brad Sherman, if he would like to go at this time.    Mr. Royce. I think one of the reasons it is the number-one concern is the testimony that I think, James, you mentioned, Hernando de Soto's work. He did a lot of work in the Philippines, and part of that was to try to determine how we could get those building blocks down so that people could borrow against property and create economic growth and how you would really have the fundamentals necessary. His work is still a best seller. ``The Mystery of Capital'' is the name of it, especially for students here. ``The Mystery of Capital, Why It Succeeds in the West and Fails Everywhere Else.'' It is a book on economics by the individual who helped do land reform in the Philippines, by this economist Hernando de Soto.    When we look at the situation after Tacloban, and our committee was there on Tacloban, we asked questions at the time about what could be done to ensure that individuals did not lose their land after the consequences of being displaced. I recently saw a story in the Philippines Enquirer that indicated that on the neighboring island of Sicogon there were 6,000 families who were prevented from returning to their homes by a company that claimed that it owned the underlying rights. It was a developer. The developer says, well, I own the underlying rights to the land on which the families lived. And, as they say in the press, these reports may be the first signs of the onslaught of an age-old problem fundamental to many conflicts in disaster- and poverty-stricken areas--access to land.    So if we could follow up on that case, I will be in contact with you.    Second, I understand USAID conducted an assessment in the Antipolo region in the Philippines and identified numerous challenges in the land tenure and titling system there. What were those challenges, quickly, if you could explain them, and I will ask USAID this question, Jonathan. How can they be addressed? And what, if anything, can USAID continue to do to help address these problems?    Mr. Royce. One of the other things that struck me when I was out there is that local security forces, private security forces seemingly, have a role or have taken a role through use of force in asserting claims by developers. I wondered, have these security forces been held accountable for such acts? And how often, in what circumstances, and at what level are these cases being raised by the U.S. Embassy in Manila? I have raised the issue on three occasions, but I just wondered in terms of the Embassy itself, do you have a dialogue going on? Maybe James could speak to that issue.    Mr. Royce. My time is almost up, but I would ask one other question along this line. How is it possible, taking Hernando de Soto's theory, that the reason we have created such incredible opportunity here in the United States is because of our ability, something we don't really understand, our ability under land title to borrow against that property? Therefore, any of us can basically start a business. Is it possible with the situation as it is in parts of the Philippines, where people do not have access to clear title, is it possible for them to go out and borrow against that home or that farm in order to raise the capital to have collateral, to have that access to the capital that they are going to use to develop something or to build on the land? What is that circumstance like in these areas where this is still a gray area?    Mr. Royce. Therefore to economic growth, to development.    Mr. Royce. To opportunity for the next generation. That is why it is so important.    But I have exceeded my time, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.    Mr. Royce. I will defer to Mr. Sherman.    Mr. Royce. Thank you, Chairman Salmon.    To pick up on the comment that Mr. Sherman is making, this is somewhat like the situation that you might hear about in the United States in some small town where, regardless of what the Federal Government does, you have well-connected developers who decide that they want a certain piece of property and then manage to manipulate the local political system in order to gain that and to push people out of their property.    So what you have in the Philippines right now is a circumstance where President Aquino has this as part of his reform program, and you have USAID on the ground trying to push this reform program, but we have a legacy problem here, as explained to me at least by some of the experts who have looked at this. This legacy problem goes back to Marcos and the decision that Marcos made, back when he introduced corruption at such a massive level.    What he did, what he decided to do, was to reward well-connected generals and commodores and those who were connected to him politically by going in and destroying part of the titling process so that he could transfer to his allies or put in motion a system where he could reward his political allies and family members and so forth.    The consequences of that is to reverse that now when it occurs at the local level you are going against something that has become, in some areas, apparently, habitual, where those who are well-connected in local government are used to being approached by developers, right?    How much is this costing the Philippines? De Soto spent a lot of time researching this problem on the ground. He put that cost at $130 billion worth of human capital, as he calls it ``dead capital.'' This is the anchor on real development in the Philippines because of the inability to get over this problem, the corruption at this local level, which then prevents people from taking the decisions they would otherwise make because of the anarchy that has been created there.    So the question I was going to ask Mr. Quinto, on my trips to the Philippines to address other issues and this issue of land grabbing, one of the things I have found is that it is the local governments that are not enforcing the law. What more could be done in order to try to make certain that the local government enforces the law and cleans up the registry in terms of land title?    Mr. Royce. Thank you.    I had one last question, and that goes to Mr. Rogers, and this goes to your issue of forcible transfer of populations. When we look at the fact that so much of the violence that is perpetrated leaves in its wake young Cambodians that are often susceptible to trafficking, I think you made the observation that we are talking about more than one crime here. By moving 800,000 people out of having any means of support, you have left them in a position of extreme vulnerability in a part of the world where trafficking is not only a practice, but my chief of staff, Amy Porter, has been twice over to Phnom Penh on this trafficking issue of underage girls, and it turns out the mayor of the city was apparently involved because the police chief--I don't know about the mayor. I know the police chief was directly involved because he owned the brothel, okay?    So you have, again, someone in Hun Sen, a Hun Sen police chief. When you have that level of corruption--and I will just give you this example. Four thousand residents surrounding Boeung Kak Lake, as you know, were evicted from their homes to make room for a company owned and controlled by a senator of the Hun Sen party. Residents who protested their homes being seized and destroyed were beaten with electric batons, according to the press. Several mothers and grandmothers were arrested and tried during a 3-hour trial. So that is the court system going to work against the local population.    So, what is the status of the individuals that were affected by this seizure of property? I was going to ask you how typical this incident is and tie it into the fact that so many of these younger people can end up in trafficking.    Mr. Royce. Thank you, Mr. Rogers.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
