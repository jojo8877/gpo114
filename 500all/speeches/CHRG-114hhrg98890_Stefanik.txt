    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the witnesses for your testimony today.    I want to address my first question to Ms. Huck and Ms. Goldberg to further delve into the impact on military families. So I represent Fort Drum, where the military resale benefit is such an important fabric of the military community.    You, Ms. Goldberg, talked about, very articulately, that the goal should not be maximizing revenue; the benefit are the savings for our military families. What are the secondary and tertiary effects that weren't included in the BCG report or weren't included in the panel today of the impact of this proposed reorganization?    Ms. Stefanik. Ms. Huck.    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you. I also wanted to just note that I think one of the most significant statements that has been made from the panel is what Ms. Goldberg said, that these savings account for a 2 percent to a 9 percent pay raise for our military families. That is significant in these challenging economic times.    I want to turn to Mr. Gordy and Mr. Nixon. BCG, obviously one of their proposals was a private label. And Ms. Huck pointed out the fact that DeCA does not have the experience, the expertise, let alone the logistics capabilities. Can you elaborate on that and the challenges that would provide and the logistical issues that we would have to overcome to make that transition?    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you. My time has expired.
