    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the panel for being here.    And Mr. Dodaro, I wish you could have talked about comprehensive tax reform a little longer. And as I sit here and listen, I am constantly brought back to the fact that maybe just per chance we've let the Federal Government get too large, but I appreciate the work you're doing in looking into what's going on.    Relative to FOIA review process, DHS has the largest backlog of any Federal agency. How does the duplicative processing like with USCIS and ICE where USCIS process certain requests, and then sends requests to ICE which processes them a second time? They had a different working relationship earlier on. How does that duplicative processing of requests contribute to the backlog?    Mr. Walberg. Why weren't they able to come to an agreement like they had in the past? What kept them from that?    Mr. Walberg. Do we see any movement that direction?    Mr. Walberg. Okay. Ms. Cobert, in GAO's 2011 report found that tracking undisbursed balances and expired grant accounts could facilitate the reallocation of scarce resources or returning funding to the Treasury. Per GAO's recommendation, OMB has instructed executive departments and agencies to take action to address undisbursed balances and expired grant accounts.    GAO's 2011 report highlighted issues related to undisbursed balances and expired grant accounts. OMB implemented GAO's recommendation and the action is considered fully addressed. What made this instance different from the other cases that OMB has not yet addressed?    Mr. Walberg. So there is follow-up between----    Mr. Walberg. Are agencies responding?    Mr. Walberg. Well, I wish you success, and----    Mr. Walberg. --I yield back.
