    Mr. Cook. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I am going to be very, very brief. I just want to mention a hearing that I had this morning. I am also on the House Armed Services Committee, and we had an individual by the name of David Ignatius. He is actually a reporter for The Washington Post. And the subject was about ISIS. We talked about Paris, obviously. I thought the focus was going to be primarily on the military. But after listening to him, because he was talking about the history and the origins and everything else, which you really, really need to understand, where ISIS has been and where it is going and objectives and some of the things which the chair talked about.    It was an outstanding hearing. And I came away from it that I said maybe sometimes we have got to actually have a combination, like we did on that hearing that you had last week with Homeland Security, and where sometimes in the House Armed Services we are only focused on the military and we don't understand a lot of the foreign policy implications, the history, the religion, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, something that was talked about.    But, anyway, I recommend that in the future. Maybe if we could do this. I was just shocked how at knowledgeable this individual was. His father, by the way, was the former Secretary of the Navy many years ago, probably when I was coming into the Marine Corps as a second lieutenant. As I remind everybody, the most dangerous weapon in the world is a second lieutenant with a map and a compass.    But it was a great hearing. And I look forward to the witnesses that we have today. The French, now more than ever, are one of our strongest allies and we have to make sure we stand with them.    Thank you.
