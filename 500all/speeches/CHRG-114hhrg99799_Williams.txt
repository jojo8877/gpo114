    Mr.  Williams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And I thank all of the witnesses for your participation today.    Mr. Birnbaum, you heard I am from Texas. In your testimony, you specifically state that private insurers can offer flood insurance and can do so more efficiently and effectively than the NFIP. I am going to agree with you 100 percent on that. And I believe the Federal Government has gotten way over its head on this issue like it does with a lot of things.    But you also state that H.R. 2901, of which I am a cosponsor and proud to be one, will not address the longer term problems with the NFIP, will not promote private market participation in the sale of flood insurance, will create bigger problems in the future when flood events occur, and will eliminate State regulatory oversight. So three questions. Number one, how can H.R. 2901 totally eliminate State regulatory oversight?    Mr.  Williams. Number two, what is your assessment of the State regulatory system in light of your statement on page 19, meaning do you have a lack of faith in the State regulatory process?    Mr.  Williams. How would the State regulation of flood insurance differ from the State regulatory process for homeowners insurance or other insurance lines?    Mr.  Williams. I am a private-sector guy. I am in the retail business. And I can tell you, in the counties I represent in Texas, we have had a lot of flood problems, and the way to get it right is turn it over to the private sector. Let the private sector compete. Let the consumer drive the industry, not the Federal Government. And I think you will see prices will be right, and service will be better.    And I am happy to be on H.R. 2901.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.
