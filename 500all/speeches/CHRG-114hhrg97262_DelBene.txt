    Ms. DelBene. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    And thank you, Director Comey, for being here and for your service. I know as Acting AG, you demonstrated a commitment to the Fourth Amendment and protecting Americans' privacy, despite enormous pressure to do otherwise, and you mentioned in your original testimony and in other comments that the rule of law and the Fourth Amendment is the spine of the FBI, and so I appreciate that commitment. I'd like to ask you a few questions about the FBI's use of aircraft.    The FBI deployed aircraft over Ferguson last year in response to requests from local law enforcement. Is that correct?    Ms. DelBene. Does the FBI respond to these types of requests frequently?    Ms. DelBene. And what criteria have to be met for the FBI to send aerial resources to assist local law enforcement, or who makes that decision?    Ms. DelBene. And what are the criteria that you use to make that decision?    Ms. DelBene. Okay. Thank you. I'd appreciate that information.    Your staff also acknowledged that the FBI ``routinely uses aviation assets in support of predicated investigations targeting specific individuals, and when requested and appropriate, in support of State and local law enforcement.''    Why is it so important to stress this distinction when it appears that it's kind of more generalized type of surveillance?    Ms. DelBene. The distinction that you have in the feedback from your staff that you use aviation assets in support of predicated investigations targeting specific individuals when in these cases of local law enforcement, et cetera, it seems to be more generalized type of surveillance.    Ms. DelBene. And do you feel that warrants are necessary when you're targeting specific individuals, especially when you have aircraft equipped with new technologies like high-resolution cameras?    Ms. DelBene. But now that there are technology changes--I think even the most recent court case, you know, Florida v. Riley, was in 1989--there has been a lot of changes in technology, and so it's not just what you might see with the human eye anymore. So are there other types of technologies, and do you think warrant standards should be in place when you have other types of technologies that might be used on this aircraft?    Ms. DelBene. So what led to the decision to seek court orders when aircraft are equipped with Stingray technology?    Ms. DelBene. You said you decided. Do you feel like that you're required by law to do that?    Ms. DelBene. Thank you. My time has expired.
