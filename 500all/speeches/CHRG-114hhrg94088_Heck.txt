    Mr. Heck. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you all for being here.    I represent the Clark County School District in Southern Nevada where about 58 percent of its almost 320,000 students are on free and reduced lunch.    We are fortunate in my community to have the Three Square food bank organization that provides a lot of services to our students, including backpack for kids, so they go home on Friday with a backpack of food to carry them through the weekend. They participate in feeding for America's Kids Cafe and they also provide summer feeding services.    Mr. Storen, you have mentioned that too many eligible children can't participate in some cases during the summer months because the program has not been updated in 40 years. What types of updates are necessary so that more children can participate?    Mr. Heck. You also talked about, you know, the importance of public-private partnerships, several of you did. In your experience, is there a specific model that seems to work better than another or a specific model that is fraught with peril and doesn't work out as well?    Mr. Heck. And I think what I have taken from most of the answers to several of the other questions is that the underlying request is really to have increased flexibility that will allow you to accomplish many of these goals and in an environment that is not as restrictive as current law.    Mr. Heck. Right, well, Mr. Chair, unlike yourself, I will yield back the balance of my time.
