    Mr. Grayson. Oh, don't be afraid of that, please. I wouldn't want that on your conscience, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary----    Mr. Grayson. Mr. Secretary, the Authorization for the Use of Military Force offered by the White House says in section 2(c): The authority granted in subsection (a) does not authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces in enduring offensive ground combat operations.    In that context, Mr. Secretary, what does ``enduring'' mean?    Mr. Grayson. Okay. So 3 days is not enduring, from what you said; 10 years is enduring.    Mr. Grayson. Well, I think maybe we should. What about 2 months?    Mr. Grayson. Would 2 months be enduring?    Mr. Grayson. Two years?    Mr. Grayson. Offensive ground combat operations.    Mr. Grayson. I am asking whether this authorizes that.    Mr. Grayson. Okay. Good let me ask you another question. Are there any geographical limitations to this AUMF?    Mr. Grayson. For instance--no. Okay. So this would authorize military action in Jordan?    Mr. Grayson. And also in Libya and in the Sinai and wherever else anybody who associates with ISIL might be. In fact, you are talking about a world war. Isn't that true?
