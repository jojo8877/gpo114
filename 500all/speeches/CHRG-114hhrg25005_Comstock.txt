    Mrs. Comstock. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the committee for holding this hearing.    You know, when my constituents, seeing as I'm in Virginia and have many Federal employees also, were notified by OPM on July of these large premium increases, they were understandably concerned, and we certainly did hear a lot from them. And that's why I had joined folks in requesting the hearing. So I appreciate you all being here and taking a look at this issue.    Walt Frances, a health economist and an expert on these programs, is quoted in the Washington Post as saying, quote, ``This never should have happened. The long-term care estimate should have been actuarially sound and accurate, taking into account far more carefully both the possibility of low interest rates, the low rate of return on premiums invested in bonds, and thirdly, the average selection by persons most likely to need long-term care.''    Could Mr. Doughty and Mr. O'Brien address the industry assumptions that were here as well as just the general statement? And maybe some others would like to join also, but why don't we start.    Ms. Comstock. I think you've addressed it a little here, but would the premium increases shorten the contract period if it went from like 7 to 3 years? Would that help? Is that something, OPM, that you're looking at?    Ms. Comstock. Okay.    Mr. Thissen, did you want to--did you want to comment at all?    Ms. Comstock. Okay. I see my time is about to expire. So thank you.    Mrs. Comstock. I just have one more question, but what percent of policyholders--I'm sorry if missed it--have dropped their policy since this increase this summer? And what percent cut back on their coverage in some way?    Mrs. Comstock. And could you--what exactly was the reduced benefit?    Mrs. Comstock. Okay. But half of them reduced their benefits?    Mrs. Comstock. Okay. Thank you.
