    Ms. Sanchez. Understanding an East Coast missile defense site will cost $4 billion (not counting manning and other Army costs), should we begin construction on such a site? What are your priorities to strengthen defense of the East Coast?    Ms. Sanchez. What improvements can and should be made left-of-launch?    Ms. Sanchez. Can you successfully execute the increase in FY16 funding for GMD?    Ms. Sanchez. Are we ahead of the threat now? Will we be ahead of the threat in 2020? And in 2025?    Ms. Sanchez.

Understanding an East Coast missile defense site will cost $4 billion (not counting manning and other Army costs), should we begin construction on such a site? What are your priorities to strengthen defense of the East Coast?    General Mann. We support the Missile Defense Agency's ongoing efforts to complete the environmental impact studies. These studies are a work in progress designed to streamline implementation should a decision occur in the future. While an East Coast site may increase capacity, battlespace, and geographic dispersion, the Warfighter's priority remains sensor architecture and ground-based interceptor reliability improvement.    Ms. Sanchez. What improvements can and should be made left-of-launch?    General Mann. It is my view that defeating tomorrow's threat will require the ability to combine active, passive, defensive, and offensive capabilities in a coherent strategy. Advancing our ability to strike left-of-launch is essential to outpacing the threat. Engaging the ``archer'' will require improved and persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. We must also continue to pursue technological development efforts related to non-kinetic defensive capabilities, such as cyber warfare and directed energy.    Ms. Sanchez. Can you successfully execute the increase in FY16 funding for GMD?    General Mann. With input from the Warfighter, the Missile Defense Agency is responsible for executing the research, development, procurement, and fielding of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System. I defer to the Missile Defense Agency to respond regarding execution of Fiscal Year 2016 funding.    Ms. Sanchez. Are we ahead of the threat now? Will we be ahead of the threat in 2020? And in 2025?    General Mann. The Ballistic Missile Defense System is currently ahead of the threat and provides the capability to defend the homeland against a limited ballistic missile attack from either North Korea or Iran. We continue to partner with the Missile Defense Agency, the Combatant Commands, and the Services to ensure we address, in a fiscally responsible manner, future ballistic missile threats.    Ms. Sanchez. What studies are underway in response to the General Odierno/Admiral Greenert memo, what do they include, what are the timelines for the studies, do they cover costs and value provided, and do they cover all the questions posed in the memo?    General Mann. Late last year, the Chief of Staff Army and the Chief of Naval Operations sent a memorandum to the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) suggesting a more holistic approach to the nation's Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) strategy. In his response, the SECDEF outlined several ongoing studies, to include the Strategic Portfolio and the Patriot Global Posture Reviews, which will shape future requirements and inform out-year budget submissions. In addition to these reviews, an update to the Joint Capability Mix (JCM) Study is currently underway. Led by the Joint Staff, JCM IV will update previous capacity and capability missile defense balance assessments within the various combatant command theaters. JCM IV is scheduled to conclude later this year. These studies, along with continuous collaboration amongst the Joint Staff and the Services, will outline a refined approach that is operationally more effective than the current method of matching specific active defense platforms against the various ballistic missile threats. They will address cost aspects, outline enhanced capabilities, and set the Department and the Services on a joint path to achieve the most efficient and effective mix of homeland and regional missile defense priorities.                                 ______
