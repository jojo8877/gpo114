    Mr. Hurd. Madam Chairman, thank you. Ranking Member, it is always a pleasure.    One of my jobs when I was in--as an undercover officer in the CIA was--my cover job was stamping visas. So I am very familiar with this program. I would like to--you know, my denial rate was pretty high. So I was pretty tough.    One of the purposes of this hearing is to examine the programs and mechanisms that are in place of the Visa Waiver Program and which strengthens homeland security and help us us identify foreign fighters. My first question is to you, Mr. Frey. You talked about these DHA audits. What other controls are there to determine that the countries participating in this are following, you know, the rules and regulations of the Electronic System for Travel Authorization?    Mr. Hurd. So to be clear, you can't just wake up--I am a Frenchman, I wake up one day, I want to go to New York City. I just can't go to the airport and jump on a plane?    Mr. Hurd. That type of audit, how often does it happen?    Mr. Hurd. For France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, are you aware of whether this review has been done in the last 6 months?    Mr. Hurd. Okay. All right. Thank you.    Dr. Bucci, this question is for you. I guess compare and contrast the information sharing that happens between countries that are part of the Visa Waiver Program and not part of that.    I would welcome, Dr. Frey, your insight and the other gentleman on the panel's insight on this question too.    Mr. Hurd. Thank you. Thank you.
