    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. DePriest, President Obama issued two executive orders, 13563 and 13610, as well as related memoranda to help reduce regulatory burdens on small business. Advocacy has provided counsel to the administration on these measures. In your view, have these executive orders made any difference in reducing regulatory burdens to small businesses?    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Okay. Mr. DePriest, under Dodd-Frank, the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau became subject to the Small Business Advocacy Review Panel process. Given that the CFPB is a newer agency, can you comment on Advocacy's experience in establishing the panel process there?    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Well, one of our concerns is we don't want for regulations to hinder the ability of small banks to provide access to capital for small businesses. So this is why it is so important that you work with the CFPB to make sure that consideration is taken when they issue regulations regarding the cost of credit for small businesses.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.    I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. I have no more questions, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
