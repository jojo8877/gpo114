    Ms. Cunningham. Sir, I will help Dr. Yehia with that.    In our current Choice law, the additional enhancements that were given to us in the May law, we were able to define the unusual or excessive burden. We implemented three of those provisions in June. The last provision required us to further define in regulation, we did that in the beginning of December and then rolled that out to our facilities.    And we looked at that providing either the ability for clinicians to make a medical determination that the person's condition required them to get care closer to their home or we identified things that were just the nature of simplicity or the frequency of the services.    So earlier during the VSO testimony, there was some discussion of getting, for instance, eye exams or audiology exams in the community because they are simple in nature. And those are actually some of the examples that we use when we talk about the simplistic nature of the type of service and being able to get that care under the unusual-or-excessive-burden provision.
