    Mr. Shimkus. Well, that is OK, because I am very curious about the response and some of my questions were involved with that. Because, I think, following up on Mr. Pallone's questions, sometimes, in essence--I don't know the right terminology--but an advocate or someone else who could give some advice on the options from a practical application. The challenge is you are given a list, pick one, and you don't have anybody to help you through that.    So, I am on the flip side. I am not sure that it costs more. I think it may save more in time, effort, energy, and frustrations, with more information as someone who is doing that on a day--someone who is doing that on a day-to-day basis.    I think the challenge of folks our age with older adults is that we don't have the experience, and then we get thrown into it based upon an event and we are still juggling our lives, too. So, do you want to--and you were going to answer and follow up on that so go ahead.    Mr. Shimkus. Oh, this is the Energy and Commerce Committee. We like that.    Mr. Shimkus. Right.    Mr. Shimkus. No. And I understand that.    Mr. Shimkus. And I appreciate that.    The other part of the questions that we have had before is about necessary data, how long do you wait before you start moving forward. What data do you think is necessary and needed for additional reform before additional reforms are adopted? So what data is not out there that you think you need to have?    Mr. Shimkus. So let me follow. I mean, you are right. It is like we choreographed this a little bit, which we did not----    Mr. Shimkus . For the record.    Mr. Shimkus. But how should CMS or Congress, then, accomplish the recommendation of this? I mean, so you are saying we should, so how should we or CMS?    Mr. Shimkus. Right. Right.    Mr. Shimkus. No. Good.
