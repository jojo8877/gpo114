    Mr. Babin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, witnesses, for being here today.    Dr. Volz, it's my understanding that NOAA relies on data from the three distinct polar orbits, early morning, midmorning, and early afternoon, which are all being filled by different partners, NOAA, DOD, and the European satellite program, EUMETSAT. How important is each orbit?    Mr. Babin. Okay. So the data from each orbit is weighed equally when integrated into numerical weather models? Is that the way that works?    Mr. Babin. I see.    Mr. Babin. Okay. What would be the degradation of our weather forecasts if there was a gap or if a partner decided not to fill a certain orbit?    Mr. Babin. Well, if you can't provide exact figures, can you commit to this committee to do the appropriate research and studies to determine the exact benefit, importance of each separate orbit?    Mr. Babin. Okay.    Mr. Babin. Okay. Thank you.    Mr. Babin. And then I'd like to ask several of you, as with most other government satellite acquisitions, weather satellite acquisition efforts consistently have experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays. Why is this so, and what can be done to your knowledge? Has anyone met cost schedule and performance goals with their weather satellite acquisition efforts? And I would say, Mr. Powner, if you would go first.    Mr. Babin. Okay. And how about Colonel Stoffler if you don't mind?    Mr. Babin. Okay. And then we probably have enough time for one more answer between Ms. Chaplain or Dr. Volz, whichever one.    Mr. Babin. Okay. That's great. Did you have something you wanted to say, Dr. Volz?    Mr. Babin. Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is expired.    Mr. Babin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.    Colonel Stoffler, one question I hear that I have for you, let me read you a portion of the national space policy signed by President Obama in 2010. The Secretary of Commerce through the NOAA Administrator, the Secretary of defense through the Secretary of the Air Force, and the NASA Administrator shall work together and with their international partners to ensure uninterrupted operational polar-orbiting environmental satellite observations. The Secretary of Defense shall be responsible for the morning orbit and the Secretary of Commerce shall be responsible for the afternoon orbit. Are you familiar with this national policy?    Mr. Babin. Currently, does the DOD have a plan and money in the budget for maintaining the morning orbit? If not, why is DOD going against national policy?    Mr. Babin. Okay. All right. I understand that NOAA--this is for you, Mr. Powner, I'm sorry. I understand that NOAA needs to launch the first polar satellite, JPSS-1, as well as the follow-up JPSS-2 to have a more robust system. We've mentioned earlier this morning. After that when does NOAA need to launch the remaining two satellites?    Mr. Babin. Okay. Thank you. Is NOAA and the federal government actually saving money by building satellites now?    Mr. Babin. Okay. And then one more question for Dr. Volz in regard to the SNPP and the ATMS instrument onboard, if the ATMS instrument fails on SNPP, what would be the backup for its measurements until JPSS-1 is operational?    Mr. Babin. Thank you, Dr. Volz, and I'll----    Mr. Babin. Thank you.    Mr. Babin. You bet. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just had one question for Mr. Powner concerning the fly-out charts and schedules annually published by NOAA. Do they accurately depict the state of our satellites in orbit, these fly-out charts?    Mr. Babin. Okay. Thank you. Why is NOAA fiddling with the estimated life span? Is it to make it appear that we are not facing a data gap?    Mr. Babin. Yes.    Mr. Babin. Okay. Mr. Chairman, that's all I had this morning. And thank you, witnesses, too. Thank you. I yield back.
