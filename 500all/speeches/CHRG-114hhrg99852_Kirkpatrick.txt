    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you. I just have a couple of questions, if the Chairman doesn't mind.    The Chairman. Sure. Absolutely. You are recognized for 5 minutes.    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. I represent a very large rural district in Arizona, vast portions of which still don't have electricity or running water. And so my question is, we talked a lot about the lease payments for oil and how that helps the farmers. But do you have any information about other energy sources, like wind or solar, or new transmission lines and how that affects our farmers? Any data on other sources?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Okay. Well, I think that is a focus that we could redirect that would be beneficial to some of the rural areas, especially in the West where transmission lines are old. The grid is not very solid and can't take on new energy sources like wind or solar. So it is a big problem for us in rural Arizona.    My other question is, besides royalty payments and additional tax revenue, talk to me about other benefits drilling brings to the farm community and other ways that industry engages at the community level.    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Are you at all familiar with the rural electric co-ops?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. That is right. And do you see any threats to that segment of the energy production?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. I have four coal-fired plants in my district. And we have converted a couple of plants in Arizona to natural gas. Do you have any thoughts about incentives that we can introduce--anybody on the panel can address this--to speed up the conversion of those coal fire plants to natural gas?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you. My time is running out. I appreciate your perspective and will give that some thought. So thank you very much.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back.    Ms. Lujan Grisham, for 5 minutes.
