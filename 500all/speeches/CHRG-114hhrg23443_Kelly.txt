    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Today, SIGAR released a report looking back at 6 years of DOD reconstruction projects in Afghanistan. Reports such as these, as well as those by various inspectors general and GAO, are critical to our ability to learn lessons from problems today and improve our efforts in the future. In fact, although U.S. forces in Afghanistan were critical about parts of SIGAR's report in their comments, they highlighted, ``the value of this report lies in consolidating lessons which may benefit organizations charged with construction efforts in similar environments.    Mr. Sopko, how else would you suggest DOD ensure lessons such as these are incorporated into their mission? And I have a cold. Excuse me.    Ms. Kelly. Okay. Thank you.    Ms. Kelly. Sure.    Ms. Kelly. You kind of answered--I was going to ask you questions about that, but I wanted to give Mr. Brown and Mr. Strickley a chance to describe how their experiences in Iraq have impacted contracting efforts in Afghanistan.    Ms. Kelly. Can I add ----    Mr. Strickley.--be a little more skeptical.    Ms. Kelly. Being overly optimistic, how much money did that cost being overly optimistic?    Ms. Kelly. Thank you. I know my time is up.
