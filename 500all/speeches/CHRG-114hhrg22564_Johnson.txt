And if they do, what are the key areas, what are the implications of that possibility, and also comment, the risks and benefits associated with NASA collaborating with China in space activities? So let me start with Mr. Shea, but I'd like each panel member to comment on that.    Ms. Johnson. Thank you.    Ms. Johnson. Thank you very much.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
