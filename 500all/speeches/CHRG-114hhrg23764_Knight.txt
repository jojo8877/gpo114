    Mr. KNIGHT. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Some of the challenges with the HUBZone program were first identified by the GAO years ago and have persisted. From your knowledge of what SBA is now doing to address these challenges, do you believe they will be resolved soon? And can you tell us some of the methods that are being used to resolve these? Mr. Shear?    Mr. KNIGHT. And I understand that. I come from one of the fastest-growing areas in the country. And, in fact, we lead the country when our economy is expanding and we are growing at a good rate. Always reaching out and making sure of the new programs and making sure that we are giving the most information is one of the hardest things for either one of us who represents these areas or one of you who is trying to reach out to the firms or to the businesses. It is always the biggest challenge in making sure they are getting the right information.    Can you tell me, over the last maybe 5 or 10 years, as the advent of new type of innovative ways to reach out, have you found one that has done more than others? Or have you found that just the same kind of walking, doing the site visits, doing all those types of things are still the most important thing?    Mr. KNIGHT. Thank you very much. I yield----    Mr. KNIGHT. Sure.
