    Ms. Chu. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Dr. Atkinson, you state that several countries around the world are limiting free trade in data, and you argue they are motivated by privacy and security concerns, national security and law enforcement concerns, and the desire for economic growth. The European Court of Justice recognized that the U.S. lacks an adequate level of protection for EU data amongst other privacy concerns.    Within this context, can you tell me how the EU views individual privacy and data security, and to what laws or principles do they have in place and what do we have in place here in the U.S.?    Ms. Chu. So what, then, do you think should be done by Congress or by the Administration in these ongoing negotiations with the EU to ensure that we're providing adequate privacy protections for our citizens, and for those whose data travels to our country from across the Atlantic?    Ms. Chu. Can you describe which countries have the most stringent regulations when it comes to setting limitations on data flowing in and out of their country? And what effect does that have an American companies' ability to compete?    Ms. Chu. Ms. Espinel, you argue that as a result of that invalidation of the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor, many routine commercial dealings between the U.S. and European countries have now been disrupted. Can you give us an example of this?    Ms. Chu. The disruptions that are occurring today?    Ms. Chu. Thank you. I yield back.
