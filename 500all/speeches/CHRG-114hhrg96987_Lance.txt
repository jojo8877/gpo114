    Mr. Lance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good afternoon to you all, and it is a pleasure to be with you. Mr. DelBianco, you have emphasized the need to stress test various proposed ICANN reforms. I certainly agree with that, and you have not suggested such tests for the technical operations of the domain name system. Can we assume that this is because they have not been tested in a real world setting for quite some time?    Mr. Lance. Thank you. Ms. Plonk, you are nodding your head. I would certainly be interested in your comments.    Mr. Lance. Thank you. To the panel in general, whoever would like to respond, in your experience, what is the international perception of the U.S.'s role in the operations and oversight of the Internet? Is there a solution that is acceptable to the international community without risking the future of the Internet? Mr. Shears?    Mr. Lance. I didn't write it, the staff wrote it, so----    Mr. Lance. Thank you. Others on the panel who might wish to comment? Yes?    Mr. Lance. Thank you.    Mr. Lance. Yes.    Mr. Lance. Yes.    Mr. Lance. Yes.    Mr. Lance. Yes.    Mr. Lance. Well, thank you very much, and California is a great state. I yield back 17 seconds.
