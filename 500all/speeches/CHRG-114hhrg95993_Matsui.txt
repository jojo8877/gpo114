    Ms. Matsui. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Dr. Miller, thank you very much for your testimony. This is somewhat similar but not really talking about hospitals here to Dr. Murphy's questions.    Under the current Medicare payment systems, there are no financial incentives for hospitals to refer patients to the most efficient or effective setting so that patients receive the most optimal but lowest cost care. Whether a patient goes to a home health agency or a skilled nursing facility, for example, seems to depend more on the availability of the post-acute care settings and their local market, patient and family preferences or financial relationships between providers.    Now, putting aside what Dr. Murphy was concerned about, and I think we all should be concerned about that, but if we proactively look at this, since patients and also, too, the hospitals have a role in this because they don't want the readmittance either, so look at that, too, but since patients often access post-acute care after a stay in the hospital, how can we best harness the hospitals to help ensure patients receive care in the right setting after a hospital stay?    Ms. Matsui. Right.    Ms. Matsui. Partners.    Ms. Matsui. Right.    Ms. Matsui. So we are taking those steps now to have the responsibility sort of be more than implicit in a sense.    Ms. Matsui. Exactly.    Ms. Matsui. The devil is in the detail.    Ms. Matsui. That is what I was----    Ms. Matsui. Yes, going toward. I have quickly, another question. What about those beneficiaries that access post-acute care without a hospital stay?    Ms. Matsui. Yes.    Ms. Matsui. OK.    Ms. Matsui. Sure.    Ms. Matsui. OK. Well, thank you very much, Dr. Miller. My time is up. Thank you.
