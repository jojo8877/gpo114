    Mr. Garamendi. Does the dilute and dispose option entail any concern over criticality as the MOX contractor is arguing? And now that the Department of Energy has terminated the program, is it still worth doing a new funding baseline for MOX?    General Klotz. Sandia National Laboratory has reviewed the recent assertions of the risk of criticality issues at WIPP and concluded they are unfounded. According to Sandia, while burial at WIPP would increase the amount of weapon-grade plutonium several fold, criticality of down-blended and packaged Pu-239 cannot result. The assertion that Criticality Control Overpacks (CCO) would become crushed resulting in criticality is simplistic and not credible. The salt formation would squeeze the disposal rooms and waste, but this process cannot separate the Pu from the diluting materials to form an undiluted critical mass.    The FY 2016 NDAA requires the Department to submit a revised Performance Baseline. Therefore, the Department is in the process of updating the performance baseline.    Mr. Garamendi. How much work are you doing in FY17 or how much capability are you retaining specifically to support the Interoperable Warhead (IW1), which was deferred at least 5 years in 2015 into 2020 or beyond?    General Klotz. NNSA plans to restart the IW-1 Phase 6.2, Feasibility Study and Design Options, in FY 2020 to support an FY 2030 first production unit. NNSA is continually developing technologies to support a variety of options for future nuclear weapon alterations (Alts), modifications (Mods) and life extension programs (LEPs), including IW-1. As those technologies mature, individual weapon programs assume funding responsibilities to further develop those technologies to full maturity for program-specific applications. As the B61-12 LEP and W88 Alt 370 move to full scale production, NNSA will transition staff and other resources from those programs to the IW-1 program.    Mr. Garamendi. Does NNSA need to produce any pits to support the current and planned life extension programs?    General Klotz. There is no requirement to produce pits for the current life extension programs (W76-1, B61-12 and W80-4). NNSA may need to produce pits to support the first interoperable warhead (IW-1). NNSA remains committed to meeting the NWC requirements for plutonium pits and we are making progress on the fabrication of a development pit using existing materials. This will help exercise our plutonium capabilities and critical skills and is a major step toward reaching pit manufacturing goals.    Mr. Garamendi. In terms of the funding profile, when does NNSA start seeing a bow-wave for funding the life extension programs?    General Klotz. Current funding in the FY 2017 Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP), specifically for life extension programs (LEPs), increases from $1.340 billion in FY 2017 to $1.919 billion in FY 2021, with significant increases occurring in FY 2018 (+$266 million) and FY 2021 (+$281 million). Beyond the FYNSP, the nominal cost of the LEPs, as reflected in Figure 4-33 of the FY 2017 SSMP, plateaus, varying between $1.8 billion and $2 billion per year. Effectively, we will have climbed the ``bow wave'' during the FY 2017     It is important to note, however, that only the W76-1 and B61-12 LEPs currently are baselined, and the W88 Alt 370, while baselined for its original scope, is being re-baselined to reflect the addition of the conventional high explosive refresh. The estimates for all other LEPs being performed over the next 25 years (W80-4, IW-1, IW-2, IW-3, and B61-13) are based on planning estimates, as described in the FY 2017 SSMP, whose cost should be viewed as a cost range. These estimates are done in advance of the 6.2/2A studies that will establish the specific scope for each LEP and are subject to change once those studies are completed. For the period FY 2022-2041, this cost range varies by about +/-$300 million per year around the nominal values described above.                                 ______
