    Mr. Sherman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I am very old. I was around when Reg D was the new thing. And we were so impressed to think that, well, we are not the accredited investors' incomes of over $200,000. That was a tiny group of people who must be incredibly smart to be making that amount of money. Now it is an amount of money scarcely more than Congressmen and Federal Judges make.    Now we are here--you--for the most part, relaxing standards, letting--providing less protection to investors so that we can provide an easier path to providing capital for business.    If Reg D made sense back in, what was it, 1982, then it can't make sense now, and vice-versa, because if it made sense to put the limit at $200,000 then, then the income level should be $600,000 to $700,000 now.    I know that there has been discussion of indexing going further, but, Mr. Beatty, have we opened the door too much by deciding that $200,000 or $1 million in assets, excluding a home, is the definition of an accredited investor who can afford to lose a lot of money?    Mr. Sherman. Mr. Beatty, was it more of a proxy for ability to absorb the loss without--    Mr. Sherman. --or a proxy for knowledge, or at least the ability to hire it?    Mr. Sherman. And does it make any sense--if it--if those were supposed to be the limits then, what should the limits be today?    Mr. Sherman. I realize that some people who make an awful lot more are unsophisticated, and some who make an awful lot less are very sophisticated. But we still have a rule based on income and assets. If we are going to have a rule that talks about accredited investor and looks at income and assets, where should we draw the line?    Mr. Sherman. Oh, more than that, but go ahead.    Mr. Sherman. Mr. Atkins, do you have any comment? And is it enough for us to just index these numbers from 2016 forward, or do we need to index them from 1982 forward?    Mr. Sherman. Let me just--
