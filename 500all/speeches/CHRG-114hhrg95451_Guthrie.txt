    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you.    You said replace an engineer with a lawyer. Aren't you both an engineer and a lawyer? So Mr. Pompeo has a good perspective.    Mr. Guthrie. Not a practicing--I will yield to you, not a practicing lawyer.    I have a question on spectrum. I have gotten involved with Ms. Matsui on the government spectrum. Hopefully free up more spectrum from auctions, so I was just going to tie into that, just some budget questions on that. And specifically the process of retaining auction revenues and how it works in practice----    Mr. Guthrie . And I am interested in what happens when the FCC is authorized to retain a certain amount to offset the cost of the auction administration in a certain year, but auctions in that particular year raise less than the threshold. I believe that this happened in 2008-'12, where in no year did the FCC reach the $85 million threshold. So my question then, when the auction failed to raise more money than the FCC is permitted to retain, how is the difference made up to cover the expense of the auctions?    Mr. Guthrie. OK.    Mr. Guthrie. Yes, the general process I am interested in.    Mr. Guthrie. Yes.    Mr. Guthrie. So can it be carried over from previous years and previous auctions, and if so, can you carry over to the future auctions and are there restrictions?    Mr. Guthrie. Yes.    Mr. Guthrie. So they can go from one year to the next, as long as they are within the cap.    Mr. Guthrie. OK. But----    Mr. Guthrie. So when it goes above the cap, well, it depends on the appropriations process you said.    Mr. Guthrie. It would revert to the deficit reduction at that point.    Mr. Guthrie. And on a related note, given that there are no significant trenches of spectrum in the auction queue beyond the broadcast incentive auction scheduled for next year, and hopefully we can do some government auction eventually, and considering the request for an increase in the cap on retention and spending of auction proceeds, because I believe in this budget request there is an increase in the cap on--in the cap on retention and spending of the auction fees.    Mr. Guthrie. So should we expect the FCC to identify additional bands that could be brought to auction during the time after the incentive auction, which would require funding to support these activities?    Mr. Guthrie. Yes.    Mr. Guthrie. Perfect. Well, I appreciate your answers in this and your forthrightness.    And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
