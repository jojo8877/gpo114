    Mr. Rokita. Thank you, Chairman. I appreciate having this hearing. Mr. Chajet, you have practiced law, you have experience practicing administrative law, correct?    Mr. Rokita. This was an informal rulemaking?    Mr. Rokita. Why?    Mr. Rokita. And you have no idea why? Have you ever experienced that in your practice before?    Mr. Rokita. In just a couple of seconds, try to explain for the record the difference between an informal rulemaking and a more structured formal rulemaking or negotiated rulemaking, and how this is different, and why in the world given the nature of an informal rulemaking you would be cut off from your testimony.    Mr. Rokita. That did not occur here?    Mr. Rokita. We have a rule with some kind of proceeding, sounds like a kangaroo court, based on untruths, half-truths, lack of transparency, facts that were not allowed to come into evidence, and testimony that was literally cut off. Is that accurate?    Mr. Rokita. They admitted to secret data? What do you mean?    Mr. Rokita. I used the pronoun, I hate doing that. I used ``they.'' Who is ``they'' again?    Mr. Rokita. Excuse me. I used the pronoun ``they.'' Who is ``they'' again? I said ``they used secret.''    Mr. Rokita. All right. Thank you very much. Ms. Herschkowitz, I appreciate your personal story, that of you and your family. Can you go into detail on how OSHA has failed to take into account public perspectives like yours, and how this is harmful to a free Republic?    Mr. Rokita. What do you mean ``ignored?''    Mr. Rokita. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, without objection, I would ask for inclusion of the document Ms. Herschkowitz was referring to into the record.    Mr. Rokita. My time has expired. I yield back.
