    Mr. Aderholt. Well, good morning. The subcommittee will come to order.    I want to welcome all of you to today's hearing, and the intent, of course, of the hearing is to examine the Food and Drug administration's fiscal year 2017 budget request.    And in addition to this committee's review of the budget request, the Members of the committee will seek information on the agency's use of current and past resources, including activities, policies, practices supported with appropriated funds.    Our witness today is Acting Commissioner of the Food and Drug administration, Dr. Stephen Ostroff. He is joined by Mr. Jay Tyler, the Chief Financial Officer for FDA. I would note that we are pleased to see the Senate confirmation of Dr. Califf yesterday in the permanent position of the FDA Commissioner.    During the transition period between Dr. Ostroff and Dr. Califf, I believe we are in good hands today. So thank you all, both you and Mr. Tyler, for being here today and for your presence.    As I mentioned, in previous hearings we have established basically four primary goals for this subcommittee as we progress through the fiscal year 2017 hearings, which we are right in the middle of now.    The first goal is increasing oversight, efficiency, and the need for effective outcomes.    The second would be keeping rural American vibrant.    Number 3 would be supporting American farmers, rankers and producers.    And No. 4, protecting the health of people, plants, and animals.    Given the myriad responsibilities assigned to the FDA by the Congress, there is a constant need for this body to increase our oversight. Our oversight not only covers the expenditure of resources, but also the corresponding activities, the efficiency in delivering those services, and the degree in which the agency delivered or failed to deliver meaningful outcomes.    At the end of the day, our constituents demand that limited resources are spent wisely. For example, the fiscal year 2016 Omnibus bill provided FDA's full funding request to continue the implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act, which we call FSMA.    Your fiscal year 2017 budget request proposes a total increase of $212 million for food safety, yet the committee is still in need of the proper accounting for food safety expenditures for the current and past years.    While you have provided us with more detail on your spending plans than in the past, we will continue to require regular updates on your use of these funds and what you are accomplishing.    FDA's fiscal year 2017 request includes a modest increase in budget authority, and that actually more closely reflects the debt crisis that is facing our nation. Our Nation is over $19 trillion in debt, as most of us know, and it requires us to trim government spending where we can and to decrease the growth of government at a minimum.    FDA is proposing discretionary increase of $31.2 million and reductions in the amount of $21.1 million, for a net increase of $10.1 million.    It is worth noting that the total resources in this request represent a 21 percent increase above the fiscal year 2012 budget request.    In looking at the proposed user fees, FDA is, again, proposing to collect and spend $202 million for new, unauthorized programs. While there is a time and certainly there is a place for user fees as demonstrated by the success of most of FDA's user fee programs, FDA provides no evidence to demonstrate that current efforts are effective in assisting the intended beneficiaries and that the resources requested for the new user fees will actually result in better service for the customers.    In addition to the President's fiscal year 2017 budget request, Congress received the administration's request for approximately $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations in response to the spread of the Zika virus. I want to echo the remarks made by Chairman Rogers of this committee and also two of our other subcommittee chairmen that the most expeditious way to respond to the disease is by the use of unobligated funds that were previously provided for the Ebola response in fiscal year 2015.    In fact, in January of 2016, FDA had far more unobligated funds left over from the Ebola appropriation than the total request for the Zika virus. This is yet another example of a situation in which the administration should utilize existing resources rather than coming to Congress for more money, which in the end compounds the nation's debt.    Another goal for the subcommittee is protecting the health of people, plants, and animals, which is also the main mission of the Food and Drug administration. The United States has one of the safest medical product markets and one of the safest, most highly productive food and agriculture sectors in the entire world.    The United States Government plays a unique role in ensuring that all of these sectors maintain their current vitality. We must continue to explore ways in which the FDA can fulfill its public health mission successfully, but do so in a way that gives regulated industry clarity on the rules of the road and they are not burdened with unnecessary regulation.    Since FDA is informing Congress that the food safety, the medical product safety, and rent and infrastructure needs are the highest priorities this year, it is incumbent upon FDA to prove to Congress that such priorities cannot be funded out of the base resources, first and foremost.    In addition, the agency must demonstrate that all efforts have been made to review current operations for any additional savings and efficiencies.    Lastly, the subcommittee and the American public need assurance that the agency is coordinating and not duplicating other efforts across Health and Human Services, USDA, and elsewhere to ensure the most efficient means of accomplishing its mission.    We hope to touch upon each and all of these issues more in detail as we move forward with the questioning portion of this hearing.    The Food and Drug administration must also tighten controls for areas subject to large expenditures which have unclear results and where performance tasks or milestones are not met, such as information technology.    In closing, I want to note that the work you and your colleagues perform at the Food and Drug administration touches the lives of every American, and we appreciate your dedicated service. Without question, you have no shortage of work to do at FDA, and there are many challenges facing your agency, from food safety, to opioid abuse, to antimicrobial resistance, and that is just to name a few.    We look forward to hearing from you today as we proceed with the remainder of this hearing and about your funding proposals for the future and for what you are doing with available resources in the current year.    So with that, let me ask the Ranking Member of this subcommittee, Mr. Farr, for any opening remarks that he might have at this time.    Mr. Aderholt. Sounds good. Dr. Ostroff, also I want to say thank you for your work. In your interim time at FDA, you have been certainly a pleasure to work with and always very reachable, and thank you for also reaching out to me on many occasions as you have done your work over there.    So without objection, your entire written testimony will be included in the record, and we will recognize you for any statements that you want to make before we go into the question portion of the hearing.    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you, Dr. Ostroff, for your testimony.    On a lighter note, before we get into some of the issues, you mentioned about the transition between you and the new Commissioner, Dr. Califf, who has been confirmed. When does that transition actually take place officially?    Mr. Aderholt. OK. That is what I wondered, if a time had been set. But regardless, as I said in my earlier testimony, we are in good hands either way.    Mr. Aderholt. We look forward to working with him, but certainly we have enjoyed working with you, and as you continue in this role, we know you will do a tremendous job.    Mr. Aderholt. Good. My first question deals with the GMO safety labeling. When Secretary Vilsack testified in front of this subcommittee two weeks ago, we touched upon two critical issues relating to GMO foods.    As background, Secretary Vilsack recently brought the two major sides together, those for mandatory labeling and those that are against mandatory labeling, and his attempt was to try to forge a compromise on the matter.    Over the past few years each side has shown great passion, as I am sure you well know, about their positions, and the current state of things, the GMO labeling debate has created much confusion on the part of consumers. My question would be, and just to the bottom line: does FDA believe that GMO products are safe for consumers?    Mr. Aderholt. Can you give us some reasons why FDA decided not to mandate labeling and the agency decision to approve the settlement?    Mr. Aderholt. Vermont's mandatory labeling law goes into effect in July, and Secretary Vilsack was quoted yesterday as saying that it will, ``create chaotic circumstances,'' for the food and agriculture industry.    As the lead agency for the labeling of 80 percent of the food supply, can FDA support preemption of menu labeling and not preemption for GMO labeling, especially if we end up with a patchwork of laws covering GMOs?    Mr. Aderholt. What would be the implications for consumers and the farmers and the food manufacturers out there with this?    Mr. Aderholt. Well, regarding GMO products, I understand the information is important to consumers, and I certainly respect that. But if GMO products are safe, then my question would be: why are FDA or even sister agencies not doing more to educate the consumers that these products are perfectly safe?    I am concerned, and I think many are concerned that some parts of the administration have not done enough to get in front of this debate and really use the influence and the information that you have to assure the public there is nothing to fear about GMO products, which as you know and as you have said have been deemed safe for decades.    So I would hope that would be something that the agencies and sister agencies could be more engaged with, and to assure the public if they are so concerned.    Mr. Aderholt. Yes. Well, the take-away, like I said, we would just encourage you to try to communicate that so the public will have an assurance that there are no safety concerns with GMOs.    Mr. Farr.    Mr. Aderholt. Dr. Harris.    Mr. Aderholt. All right. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Rooney.    Mr. Aderholt. Hold on just a second. We need to just get unanimous consent to allow the testimony.    Is there any objection?    Mr. Aderholt. Proceed on.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Bishop.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Yoder.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Palazzo.    Mr. Aderholt. Are you finished?    Mr. Aderholt. OK. At this time I would like to recognize the Ranking Member of the full committee on Appropriations, Mrs. Lowey.    Mr. Aderholt. Certainly.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Valadao.    Mr. Aderholt. Ms. DeLauro.    Mr. Aderholt. Thanks. Mr. Young.    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you, Mr. Young.    During the FDA hearing two years ago, Members on this panel raised concerns about the potential negative impacts from an FDA proposed rule on label changes to generic drugs that had the potential to allow different warning labels in the marketplace at one time. Members also raised questions about the motivation for this proposed rule after it was revealed that FDA met with a trial lawyer group prior to the FDA's issuing of the proposed regulation.    This proposal that we are talking about is against the backdrop of an environment, and I know you are well aware of it, in which many in the public are concerned about the rising cost of prescription drugs. By some estimates, the proposed change would increase the cost of the generic pharmaceutical industry by as much as $4 billion annually.    FDA, in spite of receiving more than 23,000 comments on the proposed rule, has never met with the industry representatives to discuss the rule, nor has the agency made any effort to provide a realistic estimate to how the rule would have an impact on prescription costs and access.    My question: How can the administration tell the public they are concerned about rising cost of prescription drugs on one hand, and then on the other finalize a rule that could add another $4 billion to the cost of prescription drugs?    Mr. Aderholt. Well, I just want to point out the inconsistency because the cost of drugs is a very real concern I think that the American public is concerned about. And then, of course, adding another $4 billion of costs would be something that would be inconsistent with the concerns.    During Dr. Califf's confirmation hearing over on the Senate side, he was asked about the status of finalizing the labeling rule. In response to that question, he said that finalizing the rule was a top priority, and added that FDA needs to make sure that if there are problems with generic drugs that come up later, and they do with a better surveillance system, that is a way of making sure the labels are up to date and consistent across similar products.    I believe that the pending rule would require the generic company that identified the adverse event to unilaterally change their drug label information prior to the review and approval of the FDA. But it would not require the remaining generic companies or brands to change their labeling, this continuing to allow for a lack of consistency or a lack of sameness.    In light of your desire to assure consistency and timely updates of information across similar products, why do you believe this proposed rule is necessary?    Mr. Aderholt. So when do you anticipate making a final determination on whether to move forward with this rule?    Mr. Aderholt. Do you have any evidence or data to suggest that generic drug manufacturers are not compliant with the current reporting requirements?    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you.    Mr. Farr.    Mr. Aderholt. Dr. Harris.    Mr. Aderholt. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Palazzo.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Bishop.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Young.    Mr. Aderholt. Ms. DeLauro.    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you. We have talked a little bit about tobacco and youth access and the deeming issue. Premium cigars have also been an issue. It does not have that youth access issue, and they are only sold in adult establishments. The goals of the Tobacco Control Act were to limit youth access, as you know, and prevent negative health effects from habitually used products. Neither apply, in my understanding, to premium cigars.    The question is, should FDA leave this category out of the regulations?    Mr. Aderholt. They are used for ages over 18, though. Right?    Mr. Aderholt. We have seen some situations in the past where the administrations in the past have decided to release controversial, unpopular regulations in the last few months of an administration that is not returning to power. And I guess the question would be to you is, could you inform the subcommittee if there are any regulations that are a priority to FDA that may be released before President Obama leaves office? And even if there are no specific plans for release of regulations, what might be on FDA's agenda toward the end of the year?    Mr. Aderholt. Many of our domestic producers are concerned that they are disadvantaged when it comes to treatment of imports, that they would be on the same comparison level. The regulated industry has very strong concerns as it relates to the implementation of the FSMA regulations.    According to FDA's 2010 report to Congress, the agency estimated that there were over 300,000 facilities in a hundred different countries that produce products that enter the United States at over 300 ports of entry. Despite significant funding increases from this Congress, FDA increased foreign inspections from 1,339 to 1,357, or about 18, between 2014 and fiscal year 2015.    Foreign inspections in general are often impeded by exporting countries, such as we saw in China, a country that exports quite a few food and medical products or ingredients to the U.S. The Chinese government has not been completely cooperative when it comes to granting timely work visas for our inspectors, and of course, the fear of the inspectors we have in place, the fear of inspections that they can perform.    Once FDA puts staff on the ground, they seem to have different rules for notifying the firms of FDA's plans to inspect the facility. Does FDA give notice to facilities in the U.S. when it plans to conduct an inspection for all products under its authority?    Mr. Aderholt. I think the concern is probably China. And do we have different standards in place for places like China than we do in the United States?    Mr. Aderholt. Well, as it was mentioned last year, in China investigators posted in-country generally provided a few days' notice for routine inspections unrelated to a public health emergency. And if there is a potential significant public health risk, in-country investigators can perform an inspection within a day, and unannounced when necessary. So it seems like there is maybe a different standard.    Mr. Aderholt. Have you experienced any delays in receiving visas from the Chinese government or----    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Farr.    Mr. Aderholt. Without objection, I have got a letter that I would like to submit for the record. It is signed by 109 Members regarding the development and treatment of a rare disease called Duchenne muscular dystrophy. And I would like that for the record.    Mr. Aderholt. And just in closing, when we did the fiscal year 2016 Omnibus bill, there was a restriction in there regarding the editing genes in human embryos. An advisory committee on ethical practices regarding genetic engineering of human embryos, at the request of FDA and in conjunction with the National Academy of Science, recently gave a green light to ``go forward, but with caution,'' with certain forms of genetic engineering. And I understand that the main focus of the committee was due to the eventually dream of trying to eliminate terminal diseases and also debilitating diseases.    But the fear among many, on this panel and of course constituents, and I know there are different opinions on this, but the risk of unintended consequences with genetic modification has a potential to create new defects and/or disease.    Given that FDA requested this advisory committee's work last year prior to the congressional restriction being in place, it makes some wonder whether FDA is actually engaged in the process. Can you confirm that the provision in the fiscal year 2016 Omnibus will prevent FDA from accepting applications at this time?    Mr. Aderholt. And what is FDA's position--well, clearly, based on what the restriction is, then I think that speaks for itself.    Mr. Aderholt. So with that, let me----    Mr. Aderholt. I think it went beyond just designer babies. I think it went to toying around with embryos.    Mr. Aderholt. Well, thank you, Dr. Ostroff, for being here today, and of course, Mr. Tyler, for your assistance as well. And we wish you the best. I know you will be very active, so we look forward to seeing you and continuing to work with you in one facet or another. But thank you again for your service here in this acting time.    Mr. Aderholt. Right. Well, that is what I say. We look forward to working with you.    Mr. Aderholt. Just with a little bit different hat on.                                           Thursday, March 3, 2016.                       Introduction of Witnesses    Mr. Aderholt. Well, good morning. Sorry for the delay in getting started this morning. We had votes called about 5 minutes before the hearing was to occur. So thank you all for your patience this morning, and we are probably going to have votes called in another hour, hour and a half. It just depends on how long the debate actually goes.    So what I am going to do is to hold to the 5-minute rule pretty steadily. I try to generally, but sometimes people are in the middle of an explanation and I do not want to cut anybody off, but we will try to adhere to 5 minutes so we can go through as many questions as possible and as many Members as possible.    But I want to welcome all of you to the hearing today. It is good to have all of you here. We are pleased to begin review of the fiscal year 2017 budget request from the agencies of USDA's Marketing and Regulatory Programs mission area.    And I would like to welcome to the subcommittee Mr. Ed Avalos, USDA's Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs.    Also today, Mr. Kevin Shea, Administrator for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or better known as APHIS.    Ms. Elanor Starmer, Acting Administrator for the Agricultural Marketing Service, and your first time here before us. Welcome. We are glad to have you here.    And Mr. Larry Mitchell, Administrator for the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards administration, or better known as GIPSA.    And Mr. Mike Young, USDA's Budget Officer.    So welcome to all of you.                    Opening Statement--Mr. Aderholt    I have emphasized in previous hearings that really there are four goals that we have for the subcommittee, and let me just briefly go through those.    First, of course, increasing oversight efficiency and the need for effective outcomes.    Second is keeping rural America vibrant.    Third, supporting American farmers and ranchers.    And, fourth, protecting the health of people, plants and animals.    The Marketing and Regulatory Programs mission area is key to accomplishing many of these goals. Your agencies implement programs everyday that support U.S. producers with domestic and international marketing opportunities, address agricultural threats to safeguard animal and plant health, and ensure fair practices in the marketplace, all of which have made rural America great and a world leader in agriculture.    USDA is requesting a total of $1.03 billion in discretionary resources for fiscal year 2017 for the MRP mission area and a modest increase of $8 million from the 2016 enacted level.    For AMS and GIPSA, the requests maintain current activities with only requested increases for pay costs. However, APHIS increases for animal health and emergency preparedness are mostly offset by decreases to the popular and beneficial programs that receive bipartisan support.    For example, APHIS has requested an increase to enhance implementation of the Lacey Act provisions. There is some concern, I will have to admit, about supporting such an increase at the expense of higher priority and more effective animal and plant health programs, many of which the agency has proposed to decrease.    It is this subcommittee's responsibility to ensure that the additional funds being requested for several initiatives are not to the detriment of the critical and successful programs.    As the request is analyzed, we will be looking for evidence that current efforts are effective, and I would like to know what industry and public support exist for the expanded efforts.    Last year at this hearing, we discussed the importance of your mission area, establishing a long-term strategic infrastructure plan that is crucial to moving products domestically in order to expand trade and marketing opportunities. USDA has been reacting to market disruptions like those at the ports and railroads instead of having a proactive plan in place.    The fiscal year 2016 Agriculture Appropriations Explanatory Statement directed USDA to develop an infrastructure plan that will benefit American producers, and we look forward to receiving that report.    In recent years, we have provided additional funding for APHIS to address significant agricultural threats, and just let me add we are very appreciative of your work with the private sector to address citrus greening and other threats to plant and animal health, such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza.    As you know, in the Fourth District that I represent, we have quite a few poultry producers, and the Alabama poultry industry employs over 85,000 people and generates about $15 billion annually.    In the event of an avian influenza outbreak in the northern part of the state of Alabama, our folks could face billions of dollars in losses. That is why I greatly appreciate APHIS working with its partners in the public and the private sector to prevent, control and eradicate this disease.    I know all of us will appreciate hearing more from you on the lessons that APHIS has learned in combatting this disease and how the request supports your efforts as we move forward.    Today and in the coming months, we expect to have an ongoing dialogue with your agencies in order to develop a fair and responsible budget for the next fiscal year. We will have tough allocation decisions to make, and again, I want to be sure that we maintain funding for the most critical and the most successful programs.    So at this point let me recognize Mr. Farr, Ranking Member, for any opening remarks that he may have.                      Opening Statement--Mr. Farr    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you, Mr. Farr.    Mr. Avalos, without objection, your entire written testimony will be included in the record, but I want to recognize you for your opening statement and any comments you would like to make. So go ahead, and then we will proceed with the questions.    So the floor is yours.                     Opening Statement--Mr. Avalos    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you, Mr. Avalos, and we appreciate, again, each of you being here today and for helping us get through a few questions that we wanted to pose to the panel.    I wanted to start with the discussion of highly pathogenic avian influenza. I first want to say thanks to all the folks at APHIS who really have done a tremendous job working on that program to try to combat highly pathogenic avian influenza over the past few months and working with the states and the poultry and layer industries to not only prevent but to combat and contain the disease.    As I mentioned in my opening statement, there are a lot of poultry growers and producers in the district down in Northern Alabama. So we have been closely watching the Department's response on this disease.    Second, I want to hear your thoughts on the Secretary's use of emergency authority to access $1 billion to respond to this outbreak. Previously the funds covered indemnity payments for producers as well as cleaning and disinfecting the birdhouses.    Lastly, I would like to hear from you on the lessons learned and how the fiscal year 2017 budget can help prevent future outbreaks.    My first question would be regarding the Nation's poultry sector having lost nearly 50 million birds last year. Between the Federal dollars and the losses in the private sector, this outbreak will cost well over $1 billion.    What could USDA have done differently to either identify the virus or contain the virus earlier?    Mr. Aderholt. All right. In keeping with the five minute rule, I am about down so I am going to go ahead and recognize Mr. Farr.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Yoder.    Mr. Aderholt. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Aderholt. OK. Thank you, Ms. Pingree.    The bells have rung. We have got a couple of votes coming up. So I think we will have time to go to Mr. Valadao and then we will come back and try to make sure everybody gets at least one round.    So, Mr. Valadao, you are recognized.    Mr. Aderholt. We will adjourn for votes. If you all will just bear with us for a few minutes, we will probably be back in ten or 20 minutes.    Mr. Aderholt. OK. subcommittee, come back to order. We'll recognize now Ms. DeLauro.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Rooney.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Valadao is back, so I'm going to go ahead and--you only used about half of your time, so I'm going to go ahead and give you the rest of your time on this first round.    Mr. Aderholt. You still have a little time. Go ahead if you've got--you need anything else?    Mr. Aderholt. OK.    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you. I want to ask a little bit about GMO labeling. And Mr. Avalos, and of course, anybody on the panel, I certainly need your input on this. Secretary Vilsack and the Acting Commissioner of the FDA were both here before the subcommittee. And I asked both of their opinions on the safety of genetically modified organisms, GMOs. Both of those individuals, Acting Commissioner and the Secretary, clearly stated that the science behind these products supported the federal government's position that these products are safe for planting and safe for human consumption.    He and I also spoke about the lack of information out in the public. And as you know, has been the case that we've been dealing with, regarding GMOs. And a great deal of the misinformation that is relayed in the public realm. Your mission area plays a lead role in the regulation of genetically engineered organisms, as it relates to agriculture. Correct me if I'm wrong on this, but essentially, APHIS will decide if a seed can be sold in interstate commerce, planted in the ground, or allowed to go to the market. How many years has the federal government been studying GMO products?    Mr. Aderholt. But you are responsible to go through and approve if different seeds or products can get approval, is that correct?    Mr. Aderholt. As far as what your role has been, in that limited role that you mentioned, do you have a rough estimate of how many different seeds or products have been approved by     Mr. Aderholt. Let me start out, let me go ahead and ask about one other issue that I'm aware that there are concerns from the organic egg producers about some of the requirements the National Organic Standards Board has recommended in regards to organic egg production. If implemented by USDA's National Organic Program, these recommendations would effectively ban the use of endorsed outdoor access areas that are called porches. It's already been said, and you know that we've just faced one of the largest or maybe the largest animal health event, with the outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza. It could cost over a billion dollars and result in the depopulation of nearly 50 million birds.    The egg laying industry has significantly been impacted by this. And a question, birds that are exposed to the outdoors run a much greater risk of being infected with avian influenza. Yet it sounds like the proposal would require organic layer hens to be outdoors. Has APHIS been consulted about this potential requirement, as they may have different thoughts on exposing all organic layer hens to outdoor elements?    Mr. Aderholt. So certainly that possibility is being looked at then? You're saying that they stand a much greater risk there for that to occur?    Mr. Aderholt. Yeah. Well, our hope, or my hope is that as you move forward, you would certainly carefully consider the threat of avian influenza and the devastation that banning porches could bring upon the organic egg layer industry as we move forward. So, Mr. Farr.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Valadao.    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you. I think Mr. Farr and I may have a couple of more questions as we close out. We've seen situations in the past where administrations have decided to release some controversial or more unpopular regulations in the last few months of the administration,--especially those that are not returning to power. Are there any regulations that are a priority within your mission area, that may be released before President Obama leaves office? And even if there's no particular plans to release, for release of regulations, what will be on your agenda for the end of the year?    Mr. Aderholt. OK. All right. Cervid health. As you know, in FY 2016, the Approps bill provided APHIS with no less than $3 million for cervid health activities and gave consideration to indemnity payments if warranted. Can you tell us how this funding is being spent and how much is being planned for indemnification?    Mr. Aderholt. Anything else that anyone wants to add to that? Regarding GIPSA, as your testimony notes, the budget includes a request to eliminate the limitation on inspection and weighing services. It's my understanding that this limitation has been in place for a number of years. Has the Federal Grain Inspection Service had to deny any requests for services under the limitation?    Mr. Aderholt. Without the limitation in place, how much funding would be available for grain inspection and weighing activities?    Mr. Aderholt. Well, either way. But you said $50 million would be--in the neighborhood of $50 million?    Mr. Aderholt. OK. Mr. Farr.                                          Thursday, March 17, 2016.                       Introduction of Witnesses    Mr. Aderholt. The subcommittee will come to order.    Good morning and happy St. Patrick's Day to everyone. Welcome everybody here to today's hearing.    Sorry for the little delay in getting started, but just before we were to begin the hearing, the vote was called. So we were delayed there, but we are back now. We still have another series of votes, but we are going to continue on and see how far we get before they call the vote. It sometimes can be longer than they anticipate. So we will just play it by ear.    So anyway, good morning, and it is good to have you here.    The primary goal of our hearing today is to examine the fiscal year 2017 budget submission from the Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services mission area and its respective agencies. This is the eleventh and our hearing for the fiscal year 2017 budget hearings. So we have had quite a busy month as we have heard a lot from your colleagues in the Department of Agriculture.    Joining us today are Ms. Alexis Taylor, the Deputy Under Secretary of the Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services mission area. We welcome you.    Mr. Val Dolcini, Administrator for the Farm Service Agency. Thank you for being here and welcome.    Ms. Suzanne Palmieri, who is the Administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service. Welcome.    Mr. Brandon Willis, Administrator of the Risk Management Agency. Welcome to you.    And, of course, welcome back Mr. Mike Young, the USDA's Budget Director. He gets to hear all of it, so he gets to know all of it.                    Opening Statement--Mr. Aderholt    But to begin with, I want to welcome Ms. Taylor for her first time to testify before the subcommittee in this current role. I also want to commend you and your team for achieving several key accomplishments over the past fiscal year, including opening new markets for American agricultural products, such as the South African markets, to American poultry, beef, and pork for the first time in 15 years; and the continued implementation of the 2014 farm bill; and also the reinstatement of marketing loan certificates as directed in the subcommittee's fiscal year 2016 appropriations bill.    We have emphasized in this subcommittee over the previous hearings that we have had over the last few weeks basically four areas that we try to focus on and to emphasize as we move forward. The first goal would be increasing oversight, efficiency and the need for effective outcomes.    The second is that we keep rural America vibrant.    Number 3, we support American farmers and ranchers.    And, fourth, protecting the health of people, plants and animals.    During the hearing today, we will have an opportunity to discuss the topics that include the Risk Management Agency's budget proposal to use mandatory crop insurance funding for its salaries and expenses account. We will highlight significant reductions in the U.S. commodities and maritime sealift capability supplied to food aid programs in recent years, and concerns this subcommittee has expressed in regard to the Modernize and Innovate the Delivery of Agricultural Systems Program, better known as MIDAS.    The Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services mission area plays a unique role at USDA and also within the United States economy. It implements the essential safety net for the American farmer through crop insurance. It maintains access to credit through farm ownership and operating loans and oversees numerous disaster, conservation, and supplemental assistance programs.    At the same time, the Foreign Agricultural Service is working in over 170 countries around the world to promote the products and the commodities American farmers produce.    The mission area also represents a large portion of America's humanitarian food assistance overseas, using American taxpayer dollars to send American food on American ships to feed those that are in need.    The President's budget request for the Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services mission area is $3.4 billion. This budget request uses a number of gimmicks and out-of-touch assumptions to achieve this funding level. For example, the budget shortchanges the food aid programs, including reductions of $116 million for the Food for Peace Program and $20 million for the McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program.    This comes at a time when our world is facing a global refugee crisis, one that directly affects us here at home. And I will be honest. The budget request continues in a worrisome trend we have found in many mission areas under this subcommittee: paying for discretionary programs with mandatory funding.    The President's proposal to transfer $20 million of mandatory crop insurance funding to the Risk Management Agency is simply a non-starter.    The budget also proposes to once again open up the 2014 farm bill and to cut the Federal Crop Insurance Program, which provides a crucial safety net for our farmers, our ranchers, and our producers across the country.    In 2015, USDA estimated that American producers would feel cuts of 36 percent in farm income. That is the lowest income rate in nine years.    Not only is this proposal hurtful to our agricultural economy, but also it is misguided by seeking to change a mandatory spending program through the appropriations process.    With regard to food aid programs, this budget request reflects a decline in support for key constituencies that have made up the backbone of the food aid program: the American farmers and the shippers. Changes to the traditions of these programs in recent legislation and the outright circumvention of the Food for Peace Act, largely led by this administration, have eroded the participation of these groups. This decline is reflected no more starkly than in the sharp decline in the tonnage of U.S. commodities and shipping activity in the Food for Peace program alone, a drop of almost 25 percent in metric tons since the reforms were enacted.    These reductions have been offset by the use of local and regional purchases and cash transfers backed by questionable legal interpretations. This subcommittee has been a strong champion of our food aid program and their 60-plus year tradition. Last year, this subcommittee included a one-time $250 million increase for refugees and other emerging crises around the world in the Food for Peace Program.    We have also discussed USDA's long-awaited response to the 2014 Farm Bill provision establishing an Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs. The study required by Secretary Vilsack is in its second year of delay. The fiscal year 2016 Omnibus reinforced the Farm Bill mandate and supports the establishment of this position and a new mission area. This new position would concentrate USDA's role in promoting U.S. agricultural exports, overseas imports, and supplying food aid overseas.    In closing, I would like to say that we are grateful for your mission area and the role they play in helping our nation's farmers and ranchers. I look forward to discussing these matters in a little more detail and getting your input and input from the subcommittee members as we move forward.    Before I recognize the Ranking Member, I want to say a word about a good friend and a colleague, the ranking member, Sam Farr. Sam, as you may know, has announced his retirement, and this is his last scheduled hearing to be the Ranking Member this year and this Congress, and he will be sorely missed.    He was first elected to Congress in 1993 in a special election, and he succeeded a young man by the name of Leon Panetta, and he went on to serve then on the Appropriations committee and on this subcommittee subsequent to being elected.    I believe I can speak for all of us on this subcommittee and all that know Sam that we really know that he has a genuine interest in looking out for those who are underprivileged. He has a real desire to fix problems that are in government, and we will miss his personal stories and also hearing about the Salad Bowl that he represents.    Sam, as you often do, you come and thank the Members and thank our witnesses for their service, but we do want to thank you.    I will tell you a little story. Right after I first got elected, I had the opportunity to travel on my first congressional trip with Sam, and we became friends on that trip. This was back in 1999, and we were able to go to Bosnia right after the war and see what was happening there trying to restabilize that region.    But one of the fun things about that trip is that my wife was about to have our first child, and she was 7 months pregnant, and we did not want to know if it was going to be a boy or a girl. We decided to let that be just a surprise.    But Sam predicted that it would be a girl, and he predicted that because every Member of Congress that was on that congressional trip, their first born was a girl, and Sam was right. It was a girl. Mr. Aderholt. I will always remember that. Sam, we do appreciate your service and your dedication to those not only in your district, but also California and the United States.    So let's give him a round of applause.    Opening Statement--Mr. Farrthis Sunday to Cuba. It is only 90 miles off our shore, and it imports the majority of all of its food, most of that from other Western Hemisphere countries, not from the United States, and I think we have a great opportunity to expand those markets for all our growers in the country.    You know, on a less positive note, Secretary Vilsack said here a couple of weeks ago that he described rural America as the heart and soul, not the glitz and glitter, and I do not feel that we are showing much heart or much soul in proposing cutting the Food for Peace Program. I disagree with the Chairman on the implementation of that program. I am not part of that. I think that we need to change it.    When you think about how we have to grow that food, harvest that field, transport that food, then to get on an overseas carrier, usually by ships, get it overseas, get it off those ships, distribute it to a center, then distribute it to the countries that are the recipients of that food, and then work it out in the local markets, that is the most expensive food in the world.    And what we are missing in that is we are not helping those countries invest in their agrarian economic development, not creating the opportunity to grow and create markets and investments in their own countries. I think that is why I am interested that we give some of that money to the local communities because I'm very supportive of doing that at home.    I think we need to expand. We need to invest in the Local and Regional Procurement Program. In my district right now the University of California at Santa Cruz has been challenged as have all University of California campuses to look at how you could reanalyze the markets, get all the public buying, all the buying that goes for school lunches, for universities, for jails, for hospitals, for everywhere you have these public feeding programs, and find out how much of that food is grown locally, and then if so, we just go right to those local growers and reach contracts with them.    What does that do? That cuts down on these incredible transportation costs. We are sending food away just to get it come right back, and we want to distribute that locally. So I think that is something we need to work on.    And there is some money in that for the first time, and hopefully we can keep that in there. So I think it is about smarter investments, getting a better bang for our limited buck at the federal level.    I think one of the interesting things and why most of us are on this committee, it is not just because of a commodity. Some people are on the Agriculture committee. When I got there and I told them that we grow over 100 crops in my district, they just could not believe it because they were growing corn or wheat or something like that.    I think what the Department of Agriculture is is really about all of America, the whole of America. When you think we have overseas offices, we deal with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. We deal with poverty programs. We deal with food commodity programs, specialty crops, insurance, the whole thing. It is just an awesome department.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for bearing with me for all of these years where I brag about my district, but I am not going to be representing it anymore, but I will still brag about it.    But thank you very much for giving this time to open in this last subcommittee meeting before this panel, and thank you again for your presence here today.    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Farr.    Deputy Under Secretary Taylor, without objection your entire written statement will be included in the record, but at this time we recognize you for any opening remarks you would like to make before we go into the question series of the hearing.                     Opening Statement--Ms. Taylor    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you.    Let me start out with the food aid reform issue. The President's budget, once again, proposes to slash spending for food aid, including a $116 million cut to the Food for Peace Program. The President is also proposing to transform these programs into a cash-based assistance program.    Reforms have already been enacted into law that undermine support for these programs by cutting them out of U.S. commodities and maritime sealift capability to use. I fear that the President's request has realized concerns of many past and current stakeholders about the unintended consequences associated with these proposed reforms.    As I previously noted, I know others in Congress are concerned that removing the American farmer and shipper from participation in this 60 year old tradition of the Food for Peace Program does not create intended efficiencies, but instead it will lead to cuts to the program due to simply a lack of support.    These reforms enacted for the Food for Peace Program have reduced overall commodity and sealift capability usage by almost 25 percent, as I had mentioned earlier. For example, in just the two years leading up to and following the enactment of these so-called reforms, purchases of U.S. grown rice fell by 65 percent. U.S. wheat fell by 56 percent, and U.S. soy fell by 100 percent. Even the demand for nonprofit groups seems to have drastically dropped off.    Proposals submitted to the Food for Progress Program, for example, have dropped by 76 percent in the last five years. Without the support and the participation of the American farmer and the shipper, it is hard for many of us to go back to our constituencies and justify spending more money on foreign aid programs at a time when our Nation's deficit is out of control.    In fact, when asked, the majority of Americans consistently choose foreign aid as the number one place to cut funding, and that is just a fact. I think we have to realize that.    Thankfully, this subcommittee won support in the fiscal year 2016 Omnibus for one-time additional funding of $250 million due to exceptional circumstances with the refugee crisis in the Middle East.    The budget claims that the cuts to the food aid programs are offset by efficiencies gained through the supposed reforms. Have we actually seen gains come about as a result of efficiencies enacted in the recent years, including those changes in the 2014 farm bill?    And are more people being fed now than before?    Mr. Aderholt. What feedback have you received from stakeholder groups that have traditionally been involved in the food aid programs, including the commodity groups, the maritime groups that you have dealt with, and also in regard to the reductions since these reforms have taken place?    Mr. Aderholt. Well, can you talk just a minute about the decline in the amount of U.S. commodities purchased over the past few years?    Mr. Aderholt. My time is up.    Mr. Farr.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Palazzo.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Bishop.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Valadao.    Mr. Aderholt. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Aderholt. Dr. Harris.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Yoder.    Mr. Aderholt. Mr. Young.    Mr. Aderholt. Let me talk a little bit about the trade. Under Secretary, in your written testimony, you talk about the importance of U.S. exports to the agriculture sector, and this is one of the few sectors of our economy that has a consistent trade surplus.    In order to keep this momentum and continuation at record levels, the 2014 farm bill mandated the creation of an Under Secretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs at USDA. The new position provides a focal point at the Under Secretary level for the in-the-trenches issues like the agencies that serve in the Foreign Agricultural Service, and it would establish a USDA proprietary role in providing international food aid overseas.    In the fiscal year 2015 Agriculture Appropriations Bill, money was appropriated to assist an independent study of this new position and how potential reorganization would occur.    USDA was required to complete this initial study, this reorganization, within 180 days of enactment of the farm bill. This study should have been completed August of 2014. It has been almost a year and a half, and we have still not received it.    Can you tell me a little bit about the delay and why it has been held up and what progress that you have actually made on it?    Mr. Aderholt. Well, the 2016 Agriculture Appropriations law directed USDA to complete a study by June 16th of this year, and this is the second law that has been passed that required a completion of the study.    I guess my question to you: can you personally commit that you will deliver us a report no later than that date?    Mr. Aderholt. Well, again, it has been over 2 years, and this is just a study. So what I will do is I would like to ask for your personal commitment that you will deliver that message and that you will do everything that you can when you get back to make sure that by June 16 that we have something.    Like I said, we understand the whole thing cannot be completed. We are just asking for that study to be turned into us by the 16th.    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you.    Mr. Farr.    Mr. Aderholt. All right. With that, you heard the bell. So we have got a vote on the floor, but we thank you for being here. We appreciate your service. We look forward to working with you, and we look forward to getting that report real soon.    Thank you.
