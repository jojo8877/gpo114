    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Welcome. Some of the recent major data breaches at Government agencies and Government contractors have specifically targeted personally identifying information, or PII. For example, the U.S. Postal Service data breach, over 800,000 of its current and former employees' personal information was compromised. USIS and KeyPoint contractors that perform background checks for the Federal Government suffered breaches last year also, potentially exposing tens of thousands of Federal employees' personal information.    Mr. Wilshusen, what are some of the challenges agencies face in working with contractors?    Ms. Kelly. Thank you.    Mr. Scott, what guidance is provided to agencies on ensuring the security and privacy of personally identifiable information?    Ms. Kelly. Does OMB guidance provide flexibility to agencies depending on the risk assessment of the PII it maintains?    Ms. Kelly. Do you think it is difficult for the Federal Government to recruit and retain qualified cybersecurity personnel?    Ms. Kelly. Well, is OMB doing anything special to help agencies find qualified candidates?    Ms. Kelly. I yield back my time.
