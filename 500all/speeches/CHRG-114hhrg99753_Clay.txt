    Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you to each of the witnesses for your insight and for your testimony today.    Much of our work in this subcommittee has been dedicated to finding common ground on regulatory relief. We have been partially successful in doing so, and today's hearing includes a number of proposals that provide real relief for Main Street, including H.R. 2473, as the chairman mentioned, a proposal that we have cosponsored.    I would caution my colleagues against proposals that have failed to attract bipartisan support and that undermine the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, like H.R. 2896 and H.R. 3340, or like H.R. 2287, which seeks to pressure the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) into shrinking its budget just as credit unions become more complex. Regulatory relief is a worthy objective, but it should always be balanced against broader considerations, such as ensuring the safety and soundness of our financial system, protecting the independence of our financial regulators, and supporting the implementation of Dodd-Frank.    Thank you again to each of today's witnesses. And I yield back the remainder of my time.    Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Stanley, could you describe the regulatory capture concerns that are created by a process where credit unions are shaping their regulators' budget?    Mr. Clay. So H.R. 2287, if adopted, sets a dangerous precedent for other prudential regulators?    Mr. Clay. What lessons did we learn from the financial crisis concerning the dangers of captive regulators and excessive industry influence on the budgets of prudential regulators?    Mr. Clay. Is there any reason to believe that the credit union industry won't seek the same kinds of reductions in the NCUA supervisory resources that they sought from 2001 to 2009 when the NCUA held predecisional budget hearings?    Mr. Clay. All right. At this point, Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions and I yield back.
