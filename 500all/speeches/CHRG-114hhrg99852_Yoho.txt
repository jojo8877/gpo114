    Mr. Yoho. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I appreciate you, all, being here.    Ms. Root, I see you are a cattle farmer. Congratulations. I am a veterinarian, worked on plenty of Herefords, and that is one of my favorite breeds.    What have the positive benefits been from the oil production in your area on ag, and what are the negatives that you have seen?    Mr. Yoho. Okay. And I appreciate that. You haven't seen the negative side effect, right?    Mr. Yoho. Okay. Thank you.    And I have seen that you have a tremendous amount of experience. You started off with just a few acres that you are managing, now you are manage over 200,000, is what I read.    Mr. Yoho. I appreciate that.    Ms. Sims, in your system you mentioned over-regulation as Congressman Davis brought up that do more harm than good. Do you have any specific regulations, and you cited the CDL, those are things that we are looking at, the tonnage of trucks. Are there any on the drilling side getting the permit, things like that, that you are running into from a Federal standpoint that we could look at maybe easing and turning it over to the states and let the states regulate it?    Mr. Yoho. What is the time for an average permit?    Mr. Yoho. Okay. We can get that. The other thing is, do you have NGO or environmental groups challenging you with what might be deemed frivolous lawsuits?    Mr. Yoho. Okay. And then, Mr. Causer, what are the documented or verified impacts to the residents, environment, or the ag community in your area of Pennsylvania that you have seen?    Mr. Yoho. Ms. Sims, you already answered this. So Mr. Causer and Ms. Root, have you seen any problems with wells in your area? I live on well water and it is very important to me. Have you seen a negative impact on wells from the oil production?    Mr. Yoho. It is.    Mr. Yoho. Right. I appreciate you guys and I appreciate what you do. Keep up the good work. I yield back.    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. Anyone else want a second round? G.T., you are up. G.T.
