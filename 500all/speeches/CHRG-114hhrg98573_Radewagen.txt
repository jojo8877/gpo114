    Ms. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I, too, want to thank all of you for being with us here today. My question is for all of you: Can you please discuss the most common barriers to success that student veterans encounter and what can be done to help students overcome these student barriers, especially those student veterans living in remote areas such as American Samoa, attending a local community college.    We don't have a local VA benefits counselor that can help them navigate these barriers. A benefit counselor comes from Hawaii maybe once a month or every couple months, depending on their availability, to help our veterans answer benefits questions. That is not adequate support for our veterans who are geographically and economically isolated and who live 2500 miles due south of Hawaii.    Ms. Radewagen. Thank you.    Ms. Radewagen. And I hear from Mr. Harrison.    Ms. Radewagen. That is very helpful. Thank you very much, my time is up. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
