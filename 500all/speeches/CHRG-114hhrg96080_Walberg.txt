    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Kellen, thank you for being here from your position as president of the Council 238. Could you just summarize the basics, the general approach, as to how EPA leadership handle cases of misconduct or harassment by management?    Mr. Walberg. What does the responsiveness look like, just briefly?    Mr. Walberg. Does that promote, in the culture of EPA, an effective, productive workplace?    Mr. Walberg. In your testimony, Ms. Kellen, you say that the managers are not held to the same standard as their employees. Elaborate on that a little bit more. Explain it to us.    Mr. Walberg. Right.    Mr. Walberg. I guess this is a crucial question for me to hear from you, because you have talked with your membership, other employees. What steps do you think leadership at EPA should be taking to address these management problems?    Mr. Walberg. And ultimately they listen to it.    Mr. Walberg. Okay.
