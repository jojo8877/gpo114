    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    In 1981 a professor of law at the University of Chicago described the difference between the parties as quite simple, while cautioning Republicans against the fervent pursuit of regulatory reform stating, Democrats want to run the country and Republicans don't want them to. Republicans seem delighted in the prospect of legislation that will make change more difficult. Where government action is needed by the private sector as it is for the licensing of new nuclear plants, the procedural safeguards and judicial review protections so carefully nurtured in other contexts by the corporate bar have proven to be a Frankenstein, affording licensing opponents, unlimited opportunities to impose costly delays.    The professor concluded that regulatory reform measures do not deter regulation, they deter change no matter the cost of inaction. That professor would go on to become an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court and his name, none other than Antonin Scalia. It is indeed rare for me to quote Justice Scalia in any context, let alone with approval, but I'm struck by the prescience of the Justice over 3 decades ago in describing the short-sighted nature of proponents of regulatory reform.    During today's hearing this Subcommittee will consider three pieces of legislation that do absolutely nothing to protect the public interest, grow the economy or create jobs. The only connection between these bills is their bold corporatism. H.R. 348, the so-called Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015 will result in widespread confusion and delay in the review and permitting process under the National Environmental Policy Act by carving out a separate environmental review process for construction projects, which the bill doesn't even define. And if an agency fails to meet the unrealistic deadlines mandated by H.R. 348, the bill would automatically green light a project regardless of whether the agency has thoroughly reviewed the project's risks.    This legislation is a solution feverishly in search of a problem. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported in 2012 that project approval delays based on environmental requirements are not caused by NEPA, but are more often tied to local, State and project specific factors, primarily local state agency priorities, project funding levels, local opposition to a project, project complexity or late changes in project scope.    I also have serious concerns with H.R. 712, the ``Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2015.'' Consent decrees and settlement agreements help ensure that agencies take necessary action by a certain date. The Government Accountability Office also reported in December of 2014 that there is zero evidence indicating that agencies collude with public interest groups in bringing these consent decrees that the Chamber has often claimed.    H.R. 712 would allow for nearly any private party to intervene in a consent decree revealing the legislation's true purpose of stacking the deck in industry's favor to avoid the enforcement of the law.    Lastly, H.R. 1155, the ``SCRUB Act'' is a one-way ratchet with the sole aim of prioritizing cost over benefits through the reckless elimination of rules without consideration of their benefits. This legislation would shift the cost of rules from corporations to consumers while posing substantial burdens and delays to agencies undermining public health and safety. It is indeed an act that should be scrubbed.    In closing, I strongly oppose each of these deregulatory train wrecks that comprise the subject of today's hearing.    And I yield back.    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I'd ask unanimous consent to insert the following materials into the record: a December 2014 report commissioned by the American Conference of the United States on Retrospective Review discussing the shortcomings of the square back, also testimony of Dinah Bear, the former general counsel of the Council on Environmental Quality in opposition to the RAPID Act.    The testimony of John Walke, clean air director for Natural Resources Defense Council, in opposition to the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. Also letters from the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, an alliance of more than 70 public interest consumer advocacy civil rights and justice groups in opposition to H.R. 712 and H.R. 1155, also a 2012 Congressional Research Service report on the NEPA approval process.**---------------------------------------------------------------------------    **Note: The submitted document from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) is not included in this printed record but is on file with the Subcommittee and can be accessed at: http://www.crs.gov/pdfloader/R42479.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Also, a 2014 GAO report entitled ``Impact of Deadline Suits on EPA's Rulemaking is Limited.''*** And last but not least, two reports by the Center for Progressive Reform on regulatory cut-go and the benefits of regulation.****---------------------------------------------------------------------------    ***Note: The submitted document from the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) is not included in this printed record but is on file with the Subcommittee and can be accessed at: http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/667533.pdf.    ****Note: The submitted documents from the Center for Progressive Reform (CPR) are not included in this printed record but are on file with the Subcommittee and can be accessed at:      http://progressivereform.org/articles/Regulatory_Pay----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Go_1214.pdf      http://www.progressivereform.org/articles/      RegBenefits_1109.pdf    Mr. Johnson. Thank you.    Mr. Kovacs, in your written testimony, it appears that you blame the delay in the Savannah River dredge project on the NEPA approval process, when in fact the delay was caused by funding that was not in place, and also a 2-year lawsuit by the State of South Carolina, which denied the permit to deepen the river channel. And that deepening had already been approved by the Army Corps of Engineers the lead agency overseeing the NEPA process.    So those things being true, how would the RAPID Act expedite the completion of the Savannah Harbor expansion project given the lack of Federal and State funding and the blocking of the project through the State regulatory action issues which were wholly unrelated to the NEPA approval process?    Mr. Johnson. How would it how would it--the Savannah River project, how would it----    Mr. Johnson. And so that decision would have to be made within the 2-year period regardless of what it was that was holding up the project moving forward, whether or not it be lack of funding, whether or not it be----    Mr. Johnson. But I mean, assuming you get through the environmental review process, if there is some another reason that hangs the project up, the RAPID Act would force approval of the project.    Mr. Johnson. Other than perhaps cause it not to be fulfilled.    Mr. Johnson. Well, and----    Mr. Johnson. And regardless of the cost to the--to the developer, there are some societal costs that would be incurred by failing to adhere to laws already in place, other laws that need to be followed, and the RAPID Act would be a super mandate that overrides all other laws imposing deadlines relating to project reviews by automatically approving any permit or license relating to a major Federal project if the onerous requirements are not met within 1 year. Isn't that correct?    Mr. Johnson. Well, let me ask Mr. Narang, then. Do you agree that that is correct, Mr. Narang?    Mr. Johnson. All right. Thank you.    I'll yield back.
