    Mr.  Ellison. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Ranking Member, for this hearing. I also would like to thank all of our panelists who have been so responsive and helpful to our understanding.    My first question is to Ms. Rosenberg. Ms. Rosenberg, on this Iran deal, you did publish an article, for which I want to commend you, and I thought it was well-written. One of the things you said is a successful agreement is by far the best way to reduce Iran's nuclear threat, but for any deal to work, Tehran needs to know that if it cheats, economic pain will turn in full force.    If you believe the deal, what we do have--there is a deal, there is a fair chance that there will remain one, how should we move forward given that we are going to have to monitor whatever--and have--provide oversight to how things are going? If we assume that the people who want to kill the deal are not successful, and that is a fair assumption at this point, what is your assessment on the day after, and what we should be doing?    Mr.  Ellison. Thank you. Let me ask you a question on a different topic.    About the IRS, in particular, the bank secrecy examiners at the IRS are critical in fighting against terrorist financing. How many BSA examiners work at the IRS, if you know? And I hate asking people how many because that is like an on-the-spot question. But if you know, good. If you don't, generally. Are there enough, and how many institutions are they responsible for examining?    I guess my real question is, do we have the kind of--do we have the complement of people that we need in order for the IRS to fulfill its mission under the bank secrecy examiners--with the bank secrecy examiners?    Mr.  Ellison. I wasn't trying to--    Mr.  Ellison. --put you on the spot.    Mr.  Ellison. I just want to say thanks for your great work, and I look forward to reading your next article.    I yield back.
