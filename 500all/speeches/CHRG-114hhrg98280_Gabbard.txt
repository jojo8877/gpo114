    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thanks, gentlemen, for being here.    You know, Mr. Solomon, you made a lot of references to the Cold War and some of the things that we were able to do then. Can you talk about the contemporary environment that we are operating in with both our advanced technology and others and either really what the differences are when you are talking about deception, between now and, you know, a previous generation?    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you.    Mr. McGrath, with the Distributed Lethality concept, what are the major points of resistance within the Navy to adopting this? And building off the chairman's question, how do those changes really come about?    Ms. Gabbard. I think the Navy Institute has a quote, saying that there are no leaps of technology required, no massive funding increases necessary. Do you think that that is accurate?    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
