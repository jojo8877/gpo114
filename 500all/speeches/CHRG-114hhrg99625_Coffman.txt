    Mr. Coffman. Please describe the importance of space capabilities, such as communications, missile warning, and reconnaissance is to your mission. Related, to what extent are you concerned with our posture to adequately respond to the growing Chinese counterspace threats?    Mr. Coffman. According to public reports, at a recent parade in North Korea, four missiles on KN-08 launchers were noticeably different than earlier missiles shown. Why? Are these the same missiles as previously seen or did we see in a new variant of these missiles in October?
