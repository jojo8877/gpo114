    Mrs. Hartzler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Admiral.    Just wondering when you talked about the workforce and how you are plussing up the number of people that you are hiring to make up for the backlog. So what is the shipyards doing to address the relative inexperience of this workforce?    Mrs. Hartzler. I am a former vocational teacher and I am a big believer in career and technical education. So in the schools around these shipyards, are there any specific programs that help, that students can, in high school, take that will help feed into that?    Mrs. Hartzler. Absolutely. So recently two private shipyards in the Hampton Roads area, Newport News Shipbuilding and BAE Systems announced plans to lay off 1,500 and 650 employees respectively. Are these layoffs related to the Navy's plan to hire an additional 9,000 employees?    Mrs. Hartzler. I only have about 30 seconds left, but I am just curious, of all the ships, what is the main area of maintenance? What is it that takes the most time and is the Navy looking at ways to decrease the maintenance in that area? So is it engine overhaul or is it--what would you say is the main highest maintenance area on a ship when it is--after it has been deployed?    Mrs. Hartzler. Thank you.
