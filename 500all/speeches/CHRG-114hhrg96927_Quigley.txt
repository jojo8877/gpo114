    Mr. Quigley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Welcome, Commissioner. How are you?    Mr. Quigley. We understand.    I thought about the fact that after DOMA was struck down by the Supreme Court, this must have changed some of the work that your fine people do. Can you explain some of the changes and how they have impacted your workers and what we try to do for folks to educate taxpayers about the change? Obviously, there is filing status that many people have never had the ability to enjoy.    Mr. Quigley. Were there questions from some constituents about whether they were eligible, given the fact that it is not applicable in every State?    Mr. Quigley. Well, and let me talk about that for a second, given our limited time. GAO report, the IRS is estimated to have paid out $5.8 billion in fraudulent refunds last year. That is about a 60-percent increase over 2011. And if you could also comment on the improper payments EITC, you know, what are you doing about both issues?    Mr. Quigley. You said ``infrastructure,'' is that investments in IT, or do you have the ability you just have to keep up with them?    Mr. Quigley. And just to finish the thought--and I hear what you are saying--is it just--to discourage this, this is really a question of whether they think they are going to get caught. Are the penalties severe enough, or they just don't think they are going to get caught?    Mr. Quigley. Thank you, sir.
