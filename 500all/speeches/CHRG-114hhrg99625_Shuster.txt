    Mr. Shuster. You stated in the hearing that you would rely on two more battalions of Patriot if we ``go to crisis'' on the Korean peninsula. Do you believe the overall inventories of Patriot missiles and total number of Patriot battalions are sufficient to be able to deliver this capability?    General Scaparrotti. ______
