    Mr. Massie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to yield as much of my time as he might consume to the gentleman from North Carolina.    Mr. Massie. Thank you. I just have a brief question that occurs to me during Mr. Meadows' question which is, of this classified information, if we sought to get a brief on that would you make yourself available in a classified setting for us, as we contemplate what sort of legislation might be necessary?    Mr. Massie. Is that the case for everybody?    Mr. Massie. Mr. Fugate?    Mr. Massie. Understood. Thank you very much. And I yield back.
