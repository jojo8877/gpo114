    Ms. Jaime. Mr. Chairman and Trade Subcommittee of the House of Representatives, thank you for inviting me to share my perspective on the importance of the EXIM Bank.    I have been working in the coffee industry for more than 18 years, and started my own company, Ferra Coffee International, in 2009 with $50 in the bank and a passion for international trade and soft commodities. From the start, the heart, soul, and goal of my business has always been to help coffee growers worldwide. I learned very quickly that the coffee grower is the last one in the chain of the coffee trade business to get a fair price for their product and the last, if ever, to get training to properly assess the quality of their coffee or effectively negotiate a fair price with international buyers.    To make a lasting difference in the lives of those coffee growers, by paying them fairly and according to the quality of their coffee, to prevent families from being broken apart because parents or young adults must leave their home countries and families to come to the United States to work illegally, my business plan had to change.    If Ferra Coffee sold only to distributors in the State of Texas or any other domestic state, we could only expect to sell one or two pallets of approximately 1200 pounds at a time. In contrast, when we are able to secure an international contract with an international distributor, orders are generally for at least one full container, which is 48,000 pounds average. It is easy to see the advantage.    Behind each bag of Ferra Organic Flavor Coffee, or each bag of Ferra Liquid Coffee, there are seven U.S. small businesses that supply products and services contributing to our finished product, that is labeled USDA organic, roasted, Q graded, and manufactured in San Antonio, Texas.    Ferra Coffee has successfully started offering our roasted specialty coffees internationally, thanks to the support that the EXIM Bank has provided. By their doing due diligence in checking that the distributors with whom we establish relationships and make contracts are legitimate, and that we do not get involved with dubious, unreliable, or criminal groups while conducting international trade, the EXIM Bank has truly ensured our success.    The EXIM Bank also literally insures payment of our shipments, and has given my company the peace of mind of knowing that the value of the product shipped is secure and legally insured. The EXIM Bank also allows me the ability to offer products that have a higher quality for the gourmet market.    Ferra Coffee International, along with the other small companies that are our partners, completely depends for our growth and survival on our ability to sell internationally. Internationally, there is no market saturation, and USA made and USDA organic products have a great deal of value to the consumer.    The EXIM Bank is the one and only entity that we can rely on to help us continue to grow, be competitive in markets that are not available to us in our own country, and to give us the necessary competitive edge in international trade.    My small company, by purchasing coffee directly from the growers is contributing to stopping illegal immigration and the displacement of family units. We also help seven other small U.S. businesses with opportunities to hire more workers and increase their revenue by purchasing more products for international contracts.    Without the EXIM Bank offering their services that allow my company to engage in this type of international trade contracts, I will not be able to grow my business beyond the saturated coffee market that we have in the U.S.A.    The EXIM Bank can also do so much more. It can help me, and other companies like mine which conduct businesses that are usually not funded by the regular bank system because we have contracts in international markets. By not acting as a conventional bank to qualify exporters like me for financial low interest loans. Instead of using only a credit score to qualify a company for funding, EXIM Bank could look at, and assess the overall potential, growth, and increased revenue that can be achieved by additional funding. That is the vision that is needed, and that what we are asking for.    My company is not able to get loans from conventional banks because all of my products are bought in cash. That is the way the majority of specialty coffee and tea companies operate. We do not have a history of loan payments or credit with coffee or tea growers. We need the EXIM Bank's support.    The EXIM Bank is a crucial, vital and important entity that I and many other U.S. exporting companies depend on for survival, growth, and the ability to compete successfully in business. Every U.S.A. company that has the capability to export and do business internationally, whether that company is small or large, contributes to the health of our national economy and our country's leadership in innovation, in the development of more qualified and competitive businesses, and of individuals who see our potential markets as global opportunities for the kind of success that is indeed, the greater good.    Every aspect of the EXIM Bank has the potential to create positive and strong advancement for the good of all of us, and the good of U.S.A.    Thank you for your time, kind attention, and for inviting to share my story on behalf of all exporters in the U.S.A.    ----------                                  Ms. Jaime. Yes, Mr. Chairman. My business got started basically by going to Latin America and finding coffees that were specialty graded which is one of the highest quality in coffee; bringing that coffee into the United States, and selling it here in the United States. Microroasters generally they do and roast approximately 20 pounds per batch. As time developed, we started distributing more to our market in San Antonio and we dedicated ourselves to do commercial roasting for chefs, restaurants, hospitals. We are not in the retail because the retail is over saturated. If you go to the grocery stores, you have more than a dozen different labels, of course, of coffees. So it is not a good idea for my business to have my coffee sitting on a shelf in a supermarket where it is not going to be noticeable.    Ms. Jaime. Tremendously.    Ms. Jaime. It would affect it because I am not going to be able to grow as quickly and help as many coffee growers as we can when we are exporting.    Ms. Jaime. No.    Ms. Jaime. Forty percent of my business right now.    Ms. Jaime. Well, it basically means that when we have a submission from a distributor overseas, they give us their information. We send that to the EXIM Bank. The EXIM Bank checks to make sure that there is no problems with their payments. That they have a good record of being an international distributor; if they have a history of doing any business with any manufacturer in the United States. And once we get that information back to us, then we can negotiate better with that distributor. If they have never had a history of doing business in the United States, then we are not going to be able to offer any kind of payment terms and they are going to have to pay for that order up front.    Ms. Jaime. In the majority of the countries that coffee is grown, the coffee grower is very poor and is very limited in the resources they have. It is countless and countless number of times, every year that I go to the Latin American countries, I find coffee growers that say please represent us well, ma'am. Please sell our product well and pay us well, so that I don't have to leave my country, my family, and have to go and work in the United States illegally.    Ms. Jaime. Yes, Mr. Congressman. Basically, just in my field, coffee bean is the second most profitable commodity, traded commodity. If we don't act as importers and also exporters and be able to fill right now the emerging markets, international markets for specialty coffees, you are right. Somebody else is going to get it.    One of the main problems that I have when I go to those countries to buy those coffees that are specialty and they are high quality is that the Chinese buyers are coming in and being very aggressive to be able to get those coffees. And since the coffee grower really does not know how to negotiate for those contracts, they are still on the losing side. So it is important for us not only to go, be competitive in purchasing these coffees, but immediately put them in the international market that we have a great opportunity to do that right now.
