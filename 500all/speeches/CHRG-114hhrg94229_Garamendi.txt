    Mr. Garamendi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, gentlemen, thank you for your work.    Just to continue following up on the previous questions, it looks like we are somewhere north of $17 billion for the W80-4 nuclear warhead LEP program, and the cruise missile that goes with it. You have accelerated this discussion by, I think, an incomplete answer. Why was the 2-year acceleration required?    General Klotz. The acceleration, moving it up 2 years from 2027 to 2025 for the first production unit was taken largely at the request of the Department of Defense, U.S. Strategic Command, and the Air Force for an early delivery of the capability which the long-range standoff system represents.    As Admiral Haney, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command, has said in open testimony, basically it reflects two concerns: One is the increasing sophistication of air defenses around the world; and the second is some concerns about the aging of the missile, that is the current air-launched cruise missile.    So they felt it was prudent from a military requirements point of view to move that up. And we support them on that. And, in fact, perhaps more detail than is needed, but it actually fits in very, very nicely with our work schedule and it will allow us to have sort of a smoother approach to how we do the life extension programs over an extended period of time.    Mr. Garamendi. Okay. Not okay, but thank you for the information. We were talking about responsive infrastructure before, 50 to 80 pits required. And at what cost? The infrastructure; not for the pits, but for the infrastructure?    General Klotz. I would have to get you--I could take that and get you the full cost of the plutonium strategy out through all the years. For the coming year, what we are asking for us in fiscal year 2015, Congress enacted 335--I am sorry, 35.7 for the plutonium strategy and replacement of the chemical, metallurgical laboratory at Los Alamos. That is going up to 1.55 as our budget request for 2016. As we continue to----    Mr. Garamendi. With a B?    General Klotz. I am sorry?    Mr. Garamendi. $1.55 billion?    General Klotz. Million.    Mr. Garamendi. Million. Okay. And that is the next investment on, we don't know the--you don't have the total cost of the facility?    General Klotz. We do have. We can get you that number. I don't have it.    Mr. Garamendi. You don't have it with you.    General Klotz. If I could carry numbers around in my head, I would have stayed a math major instead of becoming a poli sci major.    Mr. Garamendi. Well, I am pleased that you chose the career you have. The 50 to 80 pits is to actually produce that number of pits?    General Klotz. It is to show the capacity to produce that number of pits, is what--as we understand----    Mr. Garamendi. The assumption is at some point we would need to produce at least 50 to 80 pits?    General Klotz. That is the assumption, yes, sir.    Mr. Garamendi. And it is based on what assumption? What is the----    General Klotz. The assumption it is based on as we move into a life extension program that would affect the W78, which is a warhead used on the U.S. Air Force's intercontinental ballistic missile and would also be our first interoperable warhead , that we would need to be able to produce pits for that.    Mr. Garamendi. What do you mean ``interoperable''?    General Klotz. Perhaps maybe I will let Dr. Cook describe this since he came here and we have an open mike for him.    Mr. Garamendi. I am out of time, Mr. Chairman, but I want to get into that in much more detail.    Mr. Garamendi. And I will come back. Thank you.    Mr. Garamendi. General Klotz, is there a plan for retiring B83 and W76-0? What is the timeline?    General Klotz. Both the B83 and W76-0 are planned to be retired once confidence is gained in the B61-12 and W76-1 Life Extension Programs (LEPs), respectively. Specific planned retirement dates can be provided in a classified response.    Mr. Garamendi. General Klotz, there is some concern that the second-line of defense funding for fixed portal monitors at ports may not provide the best value for the funding. Do you agree? Why or why not?    General Klotz. The fixed radiation portal monitors deployed by NNSA's Nuclear Smuggling Detection and Deterrence (NSDD) Program (formerly known as the Second Line of Defense) are a critical element of the U.S. Government's layered approach to countering the threat of illicit trafficking. NSDD provides international partners with a suite of tools, including fixed, mobile and handheld detection equipment, training, and technical support to enhance their capabilities to detect, deter and interdict the illicit trafficking of nuclear and radiological materials. Before deploying equipment, NSDD considers a wide range of factors, including trafficking pathways, deployment environments, and partner capabilities in order to determine the most appropriate mix of equipment to counter the threat of smuggling in a particular country or region.    NSDD's fixed portal monitors work in concert with mobile detection systems to provide partners with multiple tools to prevent nuclear smuggling. Given the consequences of a nuclear or radiological device incident, it is imperative that all available tools be brought to bear to create a robust and layered defense against nuclear smuggling.    Regarding the capabilities of the fixed portal monitors, they are effective in detecting some special nuclear materials as well as radiological materials that could be used in a radiological dispersal device (RDD) or radiological exposure device (RED). Further, fixed portal monitors have detected materials of concern in the past. More detail on specific interdiction cases, as well as portal monitor capabilities, can be provided in a classified setting. Fixed portal monitors also help deter trafficking by complicating potential smugglers' task, forcing them to use alternate means that increase the probability of detection.    Mr. Garamendi. General Klotz, what is the impact of Russia withdrawing from cooperation with the United States on securing and removing fissile material in Russia? What are the alternatives to ensure these materials are not stolen or diverted?    General Klotz. Material protection, control and accounting (MPC&A) cooperation with key non-Rosatom sites and organizations is continuing under the Multilateral Nuclear and Environmental Programme in the Russian Federation (MNEPR) framework agreement, as is cooperation at a limited number of Rosatom sites and organizations. However, Rosatom informed us last December that existing cooperation would cease with most Rosatom nuclear sites and organizations as of the end of 2014.    Existing work will continue in the near future to complete security upgrades and sustainability work directly with a subset of Rosatom and non-Rosatom sites. The Russian decision to scale back cooperation has accelerated the shift from assistance to technical engagement on key foundational elements of modern and effective security. Given that Russia maintains the largest holdings of weapons-usable material, DOE/NNSA will continue to seek engagement on nuclear material security best practices with Russian sites and organizations. This includes topics such as training, regulatory development and inspections, and transportation security.    DOE/NNSA also expects to continue cooperation with Russia and third parties, including the repatriation of Russian-origin highly enriched uranium (HEU).    DOE/NNSA will also work to maintain nuclear security relationships with neighboring countries, offering continued training and training-center support to also maintain regional capabilities. We will continue to help strengthen border and port security programs with partner countries around Russia, to enable detection and interdiction of any trafficked nuclear material, including consideration of additional measures that would be prudent to pursue.                                 ______
