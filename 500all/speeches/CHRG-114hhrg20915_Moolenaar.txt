    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank our witnesses today.    I want to begin with Mr. Stoffler. If you--just on--after canceling the Defense Weather Satellite System, the Department of Defense initiated an analysis of alternatives for space-based environmental monitoring, and it's my understanding that the conclusions of this analysis prioritized a number of mission-critical issues for Department of Defense to pursue, and I just wanted to get your perspective. Is Department of Defense pursuing all the mission areas as prioritized in this analysis of alternatives?    Mr. Moolenaar. So you feel that this plan is helping to mitigate these gaps?    Mr. Moolenaar. Okay. Ms. Chaplain, would you--any comments on that assessment at all?    Mr. Moolenaar. Okay. Thank you for that feedback.    Mr. Powner, I wondered, I understand that NOAA needs to launch the first polar satellite JPSS-1, as well as the follow-up JPSS-2 to have a more robust system, and after that, when does NOAA need to launch the remaining two satellites?    Mr. Moolenaar. Okay. And are we saving money by building satellites now? Is that your understanding?    Mr. Moolenaar. And then are you concerned at all about there may be emerging technologies that if we build things now that we wouldn't be able to take advantage of those new technologies?    Mr. Moolenaar. Okay. Well, thank you very much.    And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
