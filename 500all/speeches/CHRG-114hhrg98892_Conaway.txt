    Mr. Conaway. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Hale, while not directly related to acquisitions per se, all of that evaluation data comes from the books and records of the Department of Defense. And I would be remiss if I didn't ask you your thoughts on auditing the Department of Defense, in particular the work that would have to get done to audit the rollup of DOD writ large, as opposed to the individual pieces that are going on, and then visit with us a little bit about your perspective on transitioning to new leadership next year and the risks to maintaining the pace and the momentum that is currently I perceive to be going on with respect to the audit role.    Mr. Conaway. That is exactly right. No good deed goes unpunished.    Mr. Conaway. Thank you.    Admiral, could you talk to us how, at your level, the Joint Chiefs, how that, coming from the top with respect to getting the audit done is communicated to lower levels of the organization? How did that work while you were there?    Mr. Conaway. But without that support, though, those civilian folks won't react the way that they ought to. Well, thank you all for your longstanding service to our country.    And I yield back. Thank you.    The Chairman. Mr. Larsen.
