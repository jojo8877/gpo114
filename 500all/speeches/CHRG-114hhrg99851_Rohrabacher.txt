    Mr. Rohrabacher. I will make this short. I just would like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank Ranking Member Engel. One needs only to take a look at the issues that are being discussed today to note that you are reaffirming this committee's traditional positioning and support for human rights throughout the world.    You obviously are taking up where Henry Hyde and others who before you sat in that chair, you are building upon what they created as a foundation for freedom and justice and liberty and human rights as being values that this committee will uphold. And I appreciate every one of these bills reflects that. So thank you, Ranking Member, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.
