    Mrs. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and ranking chairman as well. I am very sorry that I missed all of your discussion before this. But as a former school board member for nine years, I am just trying to understand. Certainly, the situation in San Diego, California is different, for example, then in Oklahoma.    But it seems that you are asking for a very clear rule on this, and at the same time, asking for perhaps no rule, and I wonder if you could clarify for me what you feel is absolutely best.    One of the things I know is that nothing makes people crazier, of course, when they are trying to follow the rules and having difficulty with it, and on the other hand you have just from a governance point of view the problem of a school board member who is trying to balance out very, very close numbers perhaps, percentages of young people in one group or another who need to be served, and it is minuscule in many cases, and yet they are having to decide and direct resources.    How would you do that? Because we are struggling with this, obviously. What needs to be done? How clear or on the other hand, how muddled? Which makes more sense?    Mrs. Davis. Mr. Sargrad, could you respond as well? Because I think the issue that we are all grappling with is how do you limit the inequities that children are going to experience because funds are either going towards substitute teachers or obviously we have teachers who are newer to teaching, and those schools may not be getting the funds. Where do you fall on that?    Mrs. Davis. Anybody else want to comment, especially in terms of fairness issues? What is fair?
