    Mr. Tipton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank the panel for taking the time to be here. Ms. Velazquez and I have a common interest in small businesses.    And, Mr. Garcia, you just mentioned that there was a big effort to be able to get information out to those small businesses. What is the participation level? Do you have any idea?    Mr. Tipton. I am just kind of curious. Do you have any idea--you know, if we have 100 percent independent bankers? X percent participate in some of these rollouts. Is there any way to be able to identify that?    Mr. Tipton. Great. Mr. Nichols, do you have any comments on this?    Mr. Tipton. No, okay. Great. Just as a little bit of follow-up on this, with smaller institutions, can they be a gateway to the bigger institutions when we are looking at the cybersecurity? Does that stress the importance of getting this information?    Mr. Tipton. Right. Thanks.    Mr. Garcia, something I just wrote down as you were speaking, giving your testimony was the need for more uniformity, and examinations regarding--is there duplication? Is there overlap? Are there additional costs that are being driven that could be better spent on cybersecurity?    Mr. Tipton. And just one final question here, Mr. Fitzgibbons, you mentioned about the recovery process by small and medium-sized firms after an attack. How does that compare to a big firm? I think I know the answer, but what are some special challenges our smaller firms are facing on a recovery after an attack?    Mr. Tipton. Yes. Thank you, sir. I yield back.
