    Mr. Schrader. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate that. You know, I do some of this post-acute care myself, but I am a veterinarian. So it is a little easier to do that way.    Along those lines, I guess, a question I have--looking at the IMPACT Act reviewing, I mean, that is a long-term project potentially and I am not sure we want to wait until 2024 whenever all that is done.    Is there some earlier date by which the committee or Congress should be informed by some of the information we are gleaning that you think would give us an opportunity to move forward in a very thoughtful way on this bundle payments thing?    Mr. Schrader. And what is that timeframe again?    Mr. Schrader. Next summer. OK. OK. And then you have been talking about margins quite a bit. How are you calculating those margins? In other words, if I go to my skilled nursing facility or rehab group, are they going to agree with your assessment of the margins out there?    Mr. Schrader. And why would that be?    Mr. Schrader. And how is theirs going to be different? You know, when they are calculating their margins, how are they going to be different than what the model you are using?    Mr. Schrader. All right. In the ACA, there were some demonstration projects on bundled payments and that it included, not just acute care, but some of the skilled nursing. You indicated, I think, that that was kind of a token. What are we learning from that, if anything, and if----    Mr. Schrader . It is not giving us the information we want, what should we be asking to get from what we are doing hopefully in the near future?    Mr. Schrader. Real quick. And you may not be able to answer it in time. But it seems like with the Accountable Care Organizations or, in my state, the Coordinated Care Organizations, they are willing to take a lot of risk. Can't they deal with the bundled payments also for post-acute care as well as acute care? Do we need another organization or outfit to do this?    Mr. Schrader. Yes. OK. Thank you.    And I yield back.
