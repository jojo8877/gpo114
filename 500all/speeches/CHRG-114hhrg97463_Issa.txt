    Mr. Issa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And in the case of H.R. 3750, I will be very brief.    The State Department has needed this authority for a long time, although on a routine basis there are as few as 450 individuals that this would cover in the way of first responders, and at any given time, with a typical 10-year passport, only a few would need it.    However, if there is a catastrophic event somewhere within the world and we call on a large number of first responders, many of whom may not have current passports, the ability to quickly waive it is a capability the State Department would want and need if the United States Government is directing these first responders to go to the distressed area.    And as CBO has scored it as narrowly targeted, fixed, and it will be a negligible amount and can be paid out of existing funds, it has no CBO score. It is something the State Department very much believes is in their best interest to have in the case of a major event and will have a de minimus cost compared to the cost of transporting those individuals and the benefit to America of having first responders go to the scene of a catastrophe.    And so I urge the support. And I yield back.
