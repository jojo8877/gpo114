    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I, like my other colleagues, thank you both for being here and all that you do. Of course you've just got a critical responsibility, and we appreciate the information that you provide.    I think we all know and probably most of us would readily admit the obvious appearance is we've created a monster around here, and you guys are tasked with the responsibility of keeping us aware of just how big that monster is and what we can potentially do to, to reign it in a little bit. And I wonder in that context with all the duplication that you've mentioned, are there any areas that you would just come out and be able to identify as unnecessary, that we've got so much duplication, that this area or the other one we could just do away with?    I'll start with you, Mr. Dodaro.    Mr. Hice. Okay. Ms. Cobert, do you have anything to add to that?    Mr. Hice. Sure they do. I'm positive of that.    Do you find--and that's a great example, do you find most of the time that these agencies follow your recommendations, or is that a challenge in itself?    Mr. Hice. Okay. What about--some of the issues you brought up with the DOD, we hinted around this, but the enormous amount of property and facilities that they own. And my understanding, 53 percent of it is all that they can really account for in terms of being utilized, and even a lot of that information is inaccurate. This has got to be problematic. I'm sure you've given recommendations. Are they following the recommendations that you've provided?    Mr. Hice. Right.    Mr. Hice. Right. I thank you. My time's expired, but if you could send us some information as to why they have not gotten to this, I think that would be helpful.    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
