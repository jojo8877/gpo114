    Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our witnesses for your participation here today. If we could focus a little bit, we know that one ought not wait until they need the insurance to purchase the insurance, be it prescription drug coverage, be it conventional health insurance. But we've got the penalty in Medicare Part D that is structured very differently than perhaps some other penalties to be exacted by the IRS relating to other healthcare.    Can you reflect a little bit on the effectiveness of the penalty in Medicare Part D that does exist and its productivity perhaps, just any of the witnesses?    Ms. Baicker, go ahead.    Mr. SMITH. Okay. Mr. Moffit.    Mr. SMITH. If you could, turn on your mic.    Mr. SMITH. Can you speak to the effectiveness, though, of drawing people in or onto a plan and participating in the process and how productive that has been?    Mr. SMITH. Has the penalty been effective----    Mr. SMITH . In encouraging people to join the plan?    Mr. SMITH. Okay. And perhaps for reflection later because time is limited----    Mr. SMITH . The comparison of a penalty for not signing up at the appropriate time and waiting as compared to criminalizing someone who opts for a different approach than what the government might have set out.    Mr. SMITH. Okay. Mr. Guterman.    Mr. SMITH. So what do you think is more effective, writing up someone or penalizing them fairly severely, but maybe not even enough to really get someone to make a better decision?    Mr. SMITH. Should someone have to pay a penalty for not participating at all?    Mr. SMITH. Is that a better public policy than having to pay a penalty for not participating?    Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
