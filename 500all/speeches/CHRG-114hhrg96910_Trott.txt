    Mr. Trott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Engel, for bringing these two resolutions forward.    I support H. Res. 348. The Cold War is back. The President is largely insouciant toward Russian aggression. Someone has to stand for freedom. And I hope that Russia is irritated by this resolution, but I suspect they will be just largely amused.    I also support H. Res. 354. Anti-Semitism is rampant. Mr. Sherman, I will be happy to sign that letter. It is a problem on our college campuses. And I think calling attention to the problem of Jewish safety and security is necessary. And I just want to go on the record as also strongly supporting H. Res. 354. I yield back.
