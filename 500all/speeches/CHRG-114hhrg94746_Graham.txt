    Ms. Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you all for being here.    Just last month I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation trip to Eglin to familiarize myself with the F-35 program, and it was a wonderful opportunity. I was there with Chairman Turner and my fellow Floridian, Congressman Jeff Miller. And we share--our districts are right next to one another. And so we have the ability to share the unique training that is available in the Gulf of Mexico.    And so my question goes to Dr. Gilmore, to the training opportunities in the Eglin Gulf training areas, and I am specifically interested in ensuring that the test ranges remain and have the capacity to test our F-35s and other future-generation capabilities.    So can you please talk about what the Department has been doing to test F-35s at the Gulf Test Range and, also, the efforts the Department is undertaking to ensure that our ranges, and this range in particular, are upgraded so that they can do the necessary tests on this fighter and future generations of fighters.    Ms. Graham. Can you just disclose without entering into any classified areas what is unique about Edwards that is not present at the Eglin test range?    Ms. Graham. Okay.    Ms. Graham. I understand.    Ms. Graham. Well, I appreciate that.    I would just like to ditto my colleague about how wonderful it is in north Florida. We have nice people, warm weather, and great opportunities to test these incredible air----    Ms. Graham. Right.    Ms. Graham. I appreciate that, Doctor. Thank you for your time.    Thank you. I yield back the balance of my time. Thank you.
