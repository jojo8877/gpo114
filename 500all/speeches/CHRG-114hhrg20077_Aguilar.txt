    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Halvorsen, can you talk to me broadly about in your testimony you talk about cloud computing. Where will cloud computing be in 5 years and in 10 years?    Mr. Aguilar. Is that what you mean when you talk about in page 3 of your testimony mission partner environment, when you are talking about commercially accessible, reconfigurable, and secured data that can be shared with commanders?    Mr. Aguilar. Can you talk a little bit about how you envision that working and what our stakeholders and coalition partners, what their role in that would be?    Mr. Aguilar. Well, look forward to seeing that development and our discussion about that moving forward. Thank you so much.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
