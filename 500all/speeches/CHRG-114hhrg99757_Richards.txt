    Ms. Richards. Chairman Salmon, Ranking Member Gabbard, distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear here today.    As you know, in the world today, we face an increasingly dynamic, diffused, and geographically decentralized set of terrorist threats. While the United States and our partners have made significant progress in reducing and denying terrorist safe havens, terrorist groups are still able to exploit local conditions and 21st century technology to attract, recruit, and conduct attacks. This is also true for Southeast Asia.    Globally, since 2012, we estimate that at least 36,000 foreign terrorist fighters from more than 120 countries have traveled to Syria and Iraq, including countries in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. Some of these fighters have returned home, some are arrested, but as the trends continue, they are a danger to their own countries. It is clear that ISIL is inspiring terrorist activity in Southeast Asia. As the ranking member has mentioned, ISIL claimed responsibility via its English language online magazine Dabiq for the tragic attack in Jakarta this past January which was carried out by local pro-ISIS supporters.    And as the chairman has noted, our Southeast Asia partners take this threat very seriously. The law enforcement agencies have performed remarkably well in their efforts to arrest and disrupt terrorist activity. As the chairman said, the Jakarta attack could have been much deadlier if not for the effectiveness of Indonesian authorities.    That said, as President Obama has noted, we must develop more effective partnerships and tools to holistically address the evolving terrorist threat environment. We use the framework established by the U.N. Security Council Resolution 2174 which was passed in the U.N. General Assembly in 2014, sponsored by the United States. We use this as a framework for working with our partners including in Southeast Asia to put in place the fundamental reforms that will stem the flow of foreign fighters and counter violent extremism over the longer term. These points include: Increasing information sharing among countries; strengthening aviation and border security; implementing or enhancing counterterrorism legislation and supporting prosecutions and investigations; and increasing efforts to counter violent extremism particularly through strengthening community partnerships.    I will give you a few examples of how we are implementing this approach. To counter the flow of foreign terrorist fighters to conflict zones and returning from them, we are helping our partners strengthen their connectivity with Interpol. Malaysia just very recently began systematically reporting to Interpol lost and stolen travel document data. And they recently submitted 12,000 names for lost and stolen passports.    We are working with our Southeast Asia partners to build justice sector capacity. So as you know, Chairman, from your recent visit, Indonesia's improved capacity led to the conviction of Jemaah Islamiah, founder of Abu Bakar Bashir as well as the Bali bomb maker, Umar Patek, and they are both now in prison.    In the Philippines, the State Department is supporting the FBI which is assisting the Philippine Government in building terrorist financed investigations capacity. And we have had some success there as well. But even as we work to enhance security capacity, we must also work to prevent support for countering violent extremism and recruitment to violence.    So throughout Southeast Asia, we are focused on building the capacity of locally based, civil society actors in order to counteract terrorist recruitment. We are particularly looking at radicalization to violence in prisons and we are just at the beginning of this process, but we believe it is important because many people are radicalized in prison, so we are beginning to implement coming up with some pilot projects to identify terrorist prisoners, to track them through and to figure out how to remove the threat. Also, when they are brought back into the community, how do we handle that.    I will also say in closing that overall, we strongly believe that a whole of government, integrated, and coordinated approach is the only way to effectively address these threats over the longer term and our partnerships in Southeast Asia are vitally important as you have mentioned to our collective effort to counterterrorism globally as well as in the region.    I look forward to discussing these important issues with you today and thank you for holding this hearing.    ----------                                  Ms. Richards. Yes, thank you. Thank you for the question which is absolutely essential to what we are trying to do, particularly on stopping the flow of foreign fighters, but also in preventing safe havens that could protect all sorts of terrorists.    We have sponsored a number of regional training opportunities so that countries can come together and talk about their problems and how to work together. But I would like to highlight that we recently sent our special advisor for foreign terrorist fighters, Ambassador Jake Wallace, out to Indonesia and Malaysia to talk about the full range of improvements they might make to their own homeland security system, how we can work together, how we can implement things like this Interpol initiative. So we are working very closely with the governments, talking to them frequently to identify their gaps. This is in coordination with the DHS, Department of Homeland Security, here, and with the NCTC which, of course, looks at the threat information and can focus for where the threat is.    Ms. Richards. We have a few numbers in there, included in the written testimony. Essentially, we have seen about 300 foreign fighters going to Indonesia. They bring their families so the actual number is higher, and a smaller number from Malaysia, about 75. This is, of course, Indonesia is an enormous country, so per capita it is a relatively small number and much smaller than some European countries and particularly some North African countries. But one person or one small group of people can cause a lot of damage. So although the numbers are relatively small, we take them very seriously.    Ms. Richards. Yes, I would be happy to. I will mention that I was in Australia last--about 6 months ago, I think, for a working group meeting of the Global Counterterrorism Forum which was mentioned here which Australia leads this working group, together with Indonesia, specifically on the question of deradicalization and reintegration. So we had representatives from a number of Southeast Asian countries. I happened to sit at a table with a Filipino prison official, but also from African countries and some other countries which face this threat. It is very dependent on the capacity of these countries, frankly.    In many of these countries, the prisons are overcrowded. There have traditionally not been ways of separating out prisoners. They don't have the capacity to provide real training, job employment prospects. They don't traditionally follow people after their release from prison and reintegrate into the society.    So the countries are working together and we are working very closely with them. We have identified best practices that would work within their societies, given their means. And this is has not being proposed as an action plan. We are doing trainings, the GCTF is doing trainings.    In addition, the United States sponsors a Department of Justice specialist, prison specialist in Indonesia, who has been working intensively with the Indonesian prison officials, as I said, starting with a fairly small population, but to provide a model for how we can--they can identify these prisoners and gradually, ideally deradicalize them, but at least keep them from radicalizing within the prison community.    Ms. Richards. In the case of foreign fighters, I am not sure there is a problem. In the case of Malaysia, for example, they have arrested all the foreign fighters they have identified who came back. It is eight of them. And they are all in prison.    We are more concerned about some of the terrorists who have been in prison for a while, particularly the Bali bomber terrorists who are due to be released. In fact, their on-going release is now. So we, as the United States, and also the Indonesian Government, the Australian Government, throughout the region, they are very concerned about what these people could do when they are on the outside.    Ms. Richards. Yes, the 300 went. Sixty have been stopped. They have been stopped through this kind of information sharing. Obviously, these are rough numbers and there may be some out there that we are not aware of. But the problem is more a long-term problem that we see as with many of these issues.    Ms. Richards. Congresswoman, I just want to take a very short moment to address your comment on Bangladesh because we completely agree with you. The State Department will be sending a high-level team out to Bangladesh next month to consult with them on what their problem is and how we can help them and we are doing quite a lot in Bangladesh. We can discuss separately.
