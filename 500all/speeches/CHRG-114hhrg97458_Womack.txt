    Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Admiral, for your service to our country and the testimony that you are giving here today.    It goes without saying that many members across the Capitol are concerned enough about the potential in Iran, its nuclear capability, that they have--some have resorted to doing a little bit of impromptu diplomacy in the form of letters to the Iranian government. Clearly--this is clearly all while the White House believes that their negotiations are viable ways to stop Iran from spinning centrifuges and racing toward a weapon.    I am not going to ask you about the politics or your opinion on the White House's decisions, but I do want to ask these things: How much nuclear capability does Iran have right now?                                ------                                    Mr. Womack. Seems to me that over time, we hear all of these time frames, in 6 months, in 1 year, and this has been going on multiple years, so forgive me for being a bit skeptical about some of this. I would just like to kind of get the truth as to exactly where the country is right now so that we could discern what the true and present threat is.    Now, am I missing something there in terms of just how far away they are from being able to develop weapons grade?    Mr. Womack. Is this the one area that--I know there are several areas that probably cause you some sleepless nights, but this would have to be one of them?                                ------                                    Mr. Womack. Mr. Chairman, I just have one more real quick question and then I have got to depart for another committee meeting. A number of us just returned from the Ukraine, and so I have got a question about what is going on in eastern Europe.    After signing the Iran Sanction Act in 2011, the President cancelled programs to place missile defense interceptors in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic. What concerns should we have about what our capability is in the eastern part of Europe given what is going on in the Ukraine and the potential for Russia to step up more of this aggressive nature that they seem to be playing?    Mr. Womack. Thank you, again, for your service.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, General Odierno, it is always great to see you. And I have an enormous amount of respect for what you gentlemen bring to the table in terms of your leadership of our Army, and it is always a great honor to have you in front of this committee and to be in your presence. Whenever I get a chance to travel around and visit some of the installations and at the same time execute my duties on the Board of Visitors at West Point, and I see General Odierno up there quite often, it is always great to be with you.    General, you know probably where I am going on the Aviation Restructure Initiative, still moving despite a short pause that we gave in the last NDAA that is in effect until April of next year. And I am still concerned about ARI for a lot of reasons. In my opinion, it appears to be an operational decision, not a budget decision. And so here is what I want to do. I want to drill down on the claim that we are going to save $12 billion.    The Army, and I am using the Army's numbers, has provided a breakdown of the cost savings, and I would like to point out that $10.5 billion is really not cost savings, but more cost avoidance, meaning that you count as savings not having to do modernizations and updates on Kiowas and trainers that you won't have to do now because you are divesting of them.    Furthermore, you are predicting that this cost avoidance savings, most of it won't even come, in fact, I guess the cost avoidance piece of this won't even come in the current POM, the 2015-2019 POM, they come after 2020. And the savings really don't have anything to do with whether the Apaches are moved or stay in the Guard. The operational capacity would remain regardless of whether you move the Apaches to the Army like you are proposing or whether you let the Guard keep the Apaches and keep doing the mission that they have been doing for 13 years.    So here are a couple of questions for you. Am I right? Is this more operational than budget?    General Odierno. No. It is both. So remember, we have already taken a significant amount of reduction in our Army budget. So I would remind you that there are absolutely savings now, because part of the Aviation Restructure Initiative is the elimination of three aviation brigades out of the Active Component. And as Chairman Rogers pointed out, we have already taken a brigade out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky.    Those three brigades takes about 8,000 people out, so that is $800 million a year, plus the training costs, which is another $300 million or so. So you are talking $1.1 billion per year just by taking those three complete brigades out of the Active Component. So over the POM, that is about $5 billion to $6 billion worth of savings right there.    If we kept the OH-58 Deltas we would have to modernize them, because they did not perform the way we need them to do and they put our pilots in danger. So that would be another couple billion dollars that we would have to spend in this POM right now.    So we have saved a significant amount of money doing ARI, but the reason we were able to eliminate those combat aviation brigades is because we have to move Apaches into the Active Component, so that the 10 brigades that are left in the Active Component are capable of meeting our combat needs. And by doing that, we are also transitioning UH-60s from the Active into the Guard, so we increase the number of UH-60s.    It also saves us money in our training base, because by using LUHs in the training base it is going to decrease the training time of our pilots, because what used to happen is that the old aircraft, they would train and then they would have to do extra training when they went to the UH-60 or the Apache, because it wasn't dual engine, they didn't have the right cockpits where they could look below it, and they couldn't use the night vision devices.    So it saves us money in terms of training time, and that will happen immediately, because we are now transitioning to LUHs to train our force. So there are savings that are immediate.    Mr. Womack. The Guard's been doing this mission for quite a while. Have they done a remarkable job?    General Odierno. They have, as well as the three combat aviation active brigades that we are taking out. They have done a great job too.    Mr. Womack. Has the Guard ever failed in that mission over the last few years?    General Odierno. Neither has the three aviation brigades that we are taking out either. Listen, we have had cuts, and so this is budget driven. The issue is, it is because of the complexity of the training required with the Apaches and the fact that we are going from 37 shooting battalions to 20, I need them in the Active Component to meet our requirements of today, because they are going to have to constantly deploy and they are going to have to be ready at a very high readiness level.    It is not that the Guard has failed, but when they have gotten the mission, they have gotten plenty of time to do premob training and postmob training. Because of the reductions we are taking, we don't have the luxury of being able to do that anymore.    Mr. Womack. And I know I am out of time. I just want to say this, and if it elicits a response, then fine; if not, okay as well. And this is kind of a shot at the acquisition programs, and this predates my time in Congress. But there have been two other platforms on the reconnaissance side that have been attempted by the Army that have been scrapped. And I don't know how much money that we have spent that we have--and I hesitate to use the word wasted. We never got the platform. But I am talking about the Comanche and I am talking about the reconnaissance helicopter, the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter, and I don't know what the name was.    But we have spent a ton of money looking for other platforms, and quite frankly, Mr. Chairman, I think that is why we are in the pickle that we are in right now, that we have made some decisions in the past that have not proven to be the most effective in terms of being good stewards, as we all plan to be, of our taxpayer dollars.    And now, after this Committee has given a significant amount of money for the upgrades on the Apaches for the National Guard, we are going to hand them right back over to the Active Component. Got a problem with it. I will continue to maintain my position on it. But I do appreciate the exchange here. And I yield back.    Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to go to Joint Light Tactical Vehicle for just a minute. My understanding is we are looking at a down-select sometime this calendar year.    Mr. Womack. Fourth quarter. So assuming that we have a down-select, when would we see load unit rate production on that particular piece?    Mr. Womack. Fourth of 2015.    General Odierno. Full production we would have to come back.    Mr. Womack. Yeah. So my understanding is we are going to buy, in round numbers, about 50,000 of these vehicles and the Marine Corps is going to buy another, I don't know, 5,000 or 6,000, something like that.    General Odierno. Fifty-five hundred.    Mr. Womack. General O, tell me a little bit about what you personally want to--I know that there is, like, 22 prototypes out there, we have got, what, three different companies that are competing, some consortiums--but what are you looking for? What is it that we want out of JLTV that we are not getting out of Humvee or MRAP that is critical to the foot soldier?    General Odierno. First is mobility. What we have now is the HMMWV is not big enough in order to meet our needs and integrate all of the communications and other capabilities that we need and to move our soldiers around. And we have made it so heavy now because of protection, it does not have the right mobility and actually I question its survivability.    The MRAP has great survivability but it lacks significant mobility that it could stay on the road. It has trouble off road. So the JLTV----    Mr. Womack. You are trying to find a sweet spot.    General Odierno . Is going to give us that sweet spot, and that is really what we are after.    Mr. Womack. How critical is blast--I am assuming it is very critical and it is part of the construct--that we have got to have a different kind of blast resistance because of what we are facing.    General Odierno. Yeah. It is. But it is not just blast. It is the design of it, which decreases the impact of blast as well. So, for example, one of the key things of MRAPs is they were further off the ground than HMMWVs, so they provided much greater protection. So it is a combination of blast and design that provides us increased protection of our soldiers.    Mr. Womack. What a departure from years past on these platforms.    The last question on JLTV. How are we going to apportion these out? Is there a distribution methodology right now, General O? How would you----    General Odierno. Yeah. As we do this, so we will distribute it across the total force. The majority of them in the beginning will go to the Active Component, and then what we will do is we will cascade more modern capable HMMWVs to the Guard. But over time the Guard and Reserve will receive JLTVs. So that 49,000 number is a total force number as we go forward. And, again, there will be some that go to the Guard and Reserve; there will be more that initially go to the Active.    And what we are doing is we are getting rid of the older versions of the HMMWVs, and they will get the more modern, more capable versions cascaded into the Guard and Reserve, and that will work over several years. We can get you more details on that, but that is the basic.    Mr. Womack. Yeah. Look forward to the down-select.    Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't have another question. I just feel compelled to make a comment at the risk of sounding like it is editorial in nature. There is a--there just seems to be a tendency here in Washington inside this beltway to, depending on political persuasion, to refer to OCO as a slush fund. I have to tell you, that hurts to hear it referred to--to me, a slush fund is something that would be used to spend money unnecessarily or wastefully.    And I promise you, even though we disagree on some things like ARI, and there will be other arguments down the line, and I believe these are substantive, very productive arguments, but I don't believe these gentleman here, and those that have been before us, and that will come before us are doing anything except being good stewards of the dollars that we are giving them.    So Mr. Chairman, in the season in which every single one of us are notifying young men and young women from our high schools that are receiving appointments to the Service academies to volunteer themselves to be future leaders of our military, I have just got to say, we need to be careful, that the message that we are sending is anything but that which would become a combat multiplier so that the men and women commanded by these gentlemen, and these future leaders will be enhanced.    And I just think that sometimes when we reduce the conjecture down to slush funds and those kinds of things, it sends a message that is counterproductive to the professionalism of the organizations that are being entrusted with this money. With that, I just yield back my time and I feel a lot better    Mr. Womack. I thank the chairman. And once again I join my colleagues in thanking this distinguished panel in front of us today. And my question will follow the lines that Dutch brought up and a couple of others before me.    General Horoho, it is great to see you again.    We were talking about the continuum of care. And I believe our country is a great country in part because of our ability, from the combat lifesaver all the way through the process, to the care and the well-being back here in the States, and the reintegration of our warfighters back into society despite what has happened to them.    General Horoho, you know, because you were the person that introduced this panel to Brendan Marrocco. Now, everybody up here probably has somebody from their district who could be that poster child, that example, if you will, of this continuum of care, this capacity of our country to do what we do remarkably on the battlefield. And this young man is not from my district, he is from Staten Island. I can't think of a better example of a person who is just indeed fortunate to be alive today because of what we were able to do at the time of impact and the rapid distribution of this young man back through this echelon of care, beginning with, I think it was a Navy corpsman that rendered aid to him at the time this happened.    And for my colleagues that don't remember, this was the first soldier, correct me if I am wrong, that survived double arm----    General Horoho. Quadruple amputee. Yes, sir.    Mr. Womack. Yeah. Quadruple amputee and double arm-hand transplant surgery.    General Horoho. Yes, sir.    Mr. Womack. Help me understand where he is today. Can you update me on his progress?    General Horoho. Yes, sir. It is my honor.    Brendan is doing really well. He was one of seven who received a double arm transplant. He now has feelings in his fingers and his hands. He is doing exactly what he wanted to do prior to the transplant, he is driving. And so he has a truck and another vehicle, and that is kind of his pride and joy right now. And he is down to only taking one drug for rejection, which is absolutely amazing.    And I think he represents, really, the impact of a joint system and the impact of taking the best care possible far forward on the battlefield and then having every echelon of care engaged in that throughout.    And then the other thing that I think he is such a role model for is that was a collaboration with the civilian community, with major universities, with research that had been funded years ago looking at transplantation and immunosuppressant medication. And all of that coming together allowed him to be able to have a successful hand and arm transplant surgery.    We have got seven right now that are on a waiting list across the Nation. Three of them are soldiers for face and hand transplants. And right now face and hand transplants now are considered, it happened this year, as an organ. So now they are on the donation list, which will open that up to many Americans and many soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines.think, Easter Sunday of 2009, wasn't it?    General Horoho. 2005.    Mr. Womack. Or 2005. And so here we are now 10 years later. I just think it is one of the most remarkable things I have ever read about. And being able to meet the young man in person, I just think it is incredible.    Can you help me understand what accounts in our budgeting make this kind of a story possible, so that my colleagues can understand what it is that we are doing and what more we can do?    General Horoho. So actually Matt Nathan just brought up, we have the AFIRM project that is now on the second phase of this consortium that actually started at Wake Forest University, but brings in the best of civilian researchers, along with our researchers together really looking at how do we improve burn care, transplantation, rehabilitative medicine. And that has actually funneled money, instead of individual silos competing for those dollars, it has actually put it together as a very collaborative group, which I think is a forum, that consortium concept, that will allow us to actually tackle some other major issues that we need to be looking at across the United States.    So I think the ability to continue funding those types of consortiums, that takes down the parochialisms and groups fighting for the same dollars, but rather targets military relevancy and U.S. relevancy in research that we are trying to struggle and solve the issues for.    That has been very, very beneficial. They have just actually developed a mechanism that will stretch out the skin so that it reduces scars after major trauma. They have developed a prototype for skin that is not from the human body, that allows it to be grown, and so when we look at all the burn patients that we have out there. And so they have really just advanced medicine light years.    Mr. Womack. Wow.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Womack. There might be an explanation for some of that. Just calculate how many years in Congress half of Congress has been here----    Mr. Carter of Texas. That is true.    Mr. Womack . Okay, or more than half, and how much regular order have they seen in that short period of time.    Mr. Womack. Zero. Zero.    So when you are living by CRs, you don't really--I mean, they think that CRs are the norm. That is all they ever knew.    I think you are absolutely right. And I have looked for reasons to try to figure out how do we fix that, and the only way you are going to fix that is to get back to regular order.
