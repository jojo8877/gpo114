    Mr. Scott. What additional resources do you need to dominate the cyber-battlefield? And, how would the creation of a Cyber Command enhance your ability to oppose technologically advanced adversaries?    Mr. Scott. In the wake of the nuclear test, what was the change in military relations between the United States and our South Korean partners?    General Scaparrotti. In short, the adversities we have faced since last August, to include the nuclear test, have revealed the strength of our U.S.-Republic of Korea (ROK) Alliance and made the Alliance stronger. Our military relations with the Republic of Korea (ROK) remain robust and agile as we coordinate in assessing the situation, consider Alliance options, close divergences through candid discussion, and as nations, support each other's national interests. Through these efforts, we have toughened our resolve to deter North Korea and improve our interoperable capabilities through combined actions that illustrate our Alliance strength. Extending beyond these actions, we continue to hold regular bilateral consultations at multiple levels, to include participation from other U.S. and ROK agencies, which further displays our combined dedication to deterring the threat and defending the Korean Peninsula.    Mr. Scott. What are the current gaps in your in-theatre intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities with regard to North Korea? How does the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) platform integrate into the current ISR network?    General Scaparrotti. ______
