    Mr. Connolly. I thank my friend from California for his graciousness. I have to run to another hearing.    Mr. Chairman, I want to associate myself with the remarks both of yourself and of the ranking member with respect to the Taiwan resolution we have here. And I want to ask unanimous consent to assert in the record an interesting document, pages 44 through 48 of the Department of State Bulletin from March 1979, which was their draft for what we ought to do with respect to Taiwan.    And you can see that it does not address security at all. And it took Congress to take the initiative in rewriting this into the vibrant, dynamic Taiwan Relations Act that now undergirds our relationship with that island and that was the basis for the defensive military assistance we currently provide and have provided to Taiwan. It is a great example of actually congressional foreign policymaking that was desperately needed. A vacuum had been created, and we rose to the occasion.    So I would ask unanimous consent to enter this into the record. It is a rather rare document. And I think it underscores----    Mr. Connolly. I thank the chair. And I thank Mr. Sherman so much for his courtesy.
