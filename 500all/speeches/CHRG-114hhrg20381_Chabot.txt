    Mr. Chabot. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to thank you for holding this hearing and thank the witnesses for being here. As a former chair of this committee, I have taken a particular interest in Sri Lanka and I visited there and been in the northeast and saw the burned-out buildings and a lot of the damage and things which had been caused by a lot of years of war and a lot of lives destroyed.    And just yesterday Sri Lanka acknowledged approximately 65,000 people missing during the 26 years of the off and on civil war. But now 6 years after the official end of the civil war there may be real opportunity to reconcile the people of Sri Lanka and rebuilt this really beautiful country. So I hope that they are successful.    However, I do remain somewhat weary. Although Sri Lanka is in the midst of early signs of actually attaining a sustaining peace and democracy, the scars of the civil war still remain and recently it was somewhat alarming when President Sirisena vowed to eradicate the LTTE ideologies both locally and internationally and I think this kind of rhetoric can be counterproductive but also damaging for the long-term prospects for national reconciliation, which is absolutely critical.    So I know these are exceptionally complex issues. I thank you and commend you for holding the hearing and yield back.
