    Mr. Boyle. Thank you.    And I waited the 3 hours here to ask this one question because I was concerned that this issue might be overlooked with the plethora of issues that we have and that you have, Secretary Kerry, around the world. One of the great achievements of the last 20 years of American foreign policy was forging a peace agreement in Northern Ireland. We are now 15, 16 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, and tensions still remain. The House, the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, appropriated $2.5 million for the International Fund for Ireland, but the State Department is hesitating in releasing it.    Secretary Kerry, would you please commit to me and to Congress that these funds will be released by the State Department, and the United States will continue to play a strong and active role in the Northern Ireland peace situation?
