    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Serrano.    I would like to now recognize Mr. Rogers, who is chairman of the full committee, for any opening statement he might like to make.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Commissioner, I would like to now recognize you. If you could keep your oral presentation to about 5 minutes, that will give us more time for questions. And your entire statement will be included in the record. So the floor is yours.    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, thank you very much.    And let me start with a couple of questions. You know, you mentioned your goals. We have talked about the fact that $290 million of additional appropriations came to you for those three areas: customer service, fraud detection, and better dealing with cybersecurity. And you outlined how you plan to use that in the sense of having some broad goals.    Let's begin by telling us specifically what do you plan to do. Because one of the things, it is great to have goals, but they need to be implemented. And tell us specifically how are you going to deal with customer service. Are people going to still wait on the telephone? How are you going to deal with that?    How are you going to implement that goal of making sure that you are detecting fraud, taxpayer fraud? Because right now, customer service is at an all-time low and tax fraud is rising every year. Give us a couple of specific ways that you are going to try to implement those goals in those three areas.    Mr. Crenshaw. How are you going to do that?    Mr. Crenshaw. Twenty percent of that new money was going to go for customer service, right?    Mr. Crenshaw. That is good. So that is a big priority, right?    Mr. Crenshaw. Tell us about----    Mr. Crenshaw. And before that, just identity theft.    Mr. Crenshaw. How much did we lose--do you know the latest number--in terms of tax identity theft? One time there was like $9 billion. What is that number today?    Mr. Crenshaw. Great. Well, thank you for that.    Let me go now to Mr. Serrano.    Thank you, sir.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Crenshaw. Mr. Rogers.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And, Commissioner, you hear this over and over again from this committee, you get $11 billion, and you have got a lot of things to do, just like we all have got a lot of things to do, and it is all about priority. And what the message is, it seems like the most important priority ought to be customer service. And I think the criticism is, from time to time, money goes to other places that don't seem to be as important as customer service.    So I think you are getting the message that we would say--sometimes people say: Well, the way the Federal Government works is when they cut their budgets, they find the place that creates more pain to the average citizen and then everybody thinks they need more money.    So I think you got the message that we just want you to make sure that you make this a priority. That is all we have got to say.    Mr. Bishop.    Mr. Crenshaw. No, he is asking for $12 billion.    Mr. Crenshaw. No, that is last year.    Mr. Crenshaw. Mr. Bishop, please.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you very much.    Let's go now to Mr. Graves.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Quigley.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Yoder.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Just a quick question. You mentioned that identity theft costs $5 billion or $6 billion a year. What are the latest numbers on how much the earned income tax credit error rate costs?    Mr. Crenshaw. What is that in real numbers? At one time it was $19 billion. Do you know what is the latest?    Mr. Crenshaw. That is a lot of money.    Mr. Crenshaw. It would be nice.    Mr. Rigell.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, sir.    Mr. Amodei.    Mr. Crenshaw. And, Mr. Amodei, if you would like another 5-minute speed date, if you just sit quietly for a couple of minutes you will have that opportunity. So we will have another round.    Just what I would like to know is, I mentioned in my opening statement that you had this hardware failure, and I think that there is a hearing today on that. Tell us a little about how that happened. I think there was a destruction of one of the hard drives. Plus the problem, I guess, the breakdown. How did that happen? And how does that affect folks that are filing their tax returns?    Mr. Crenshaw. And then the destruction of that hard drive.    Mr. Crenshaw. OK.    Mr. Crenshaw. There was no corruption of the data and it just kind of slows things down for----    Mr. Crenshaw. Just put you behind that.    Mr. Crenshaw. How about the destruction of that hard drive? Evidently there was an order to preserve the contents.    Mr. Crenshaw. In a minute, I would like you to talk more about this whole modernization. You just hear over and over again that somehow IRS needs to kind of transform itself, modernize itself. A lot of that has to do with technology. We will save that for a minute.    But Mr. Serrano, and then Mr. Amodei after that.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Now for another speed date from Mr. Amodei. Take your time.    Mr. Crenshaw. That is right. And he can have some of my next 5 minutes if he wants them.    Mr. Crenshaw. You are on a roll. You want to keep going?    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you very much.    Just real quick, how much money, how much revenue did we collect last year?    Mr. Crenshaw. When is the last time we collected $3 trillion?    Mr. Crenshaw. So would you say this last year that you collected more than you had ever collected before?    Mr. Crenshaw. The enforcement collections, do they go up and down?    Mr. Crenshaw. I would just encourage you, this is like priorities in terms of customer service. I mean, you know where the revenue comes from, and I would think those, you would want to make that a priority. If you only have so much money, you have to decide where you are going to spend it.    Mr. Crenshaw. And I think you are doing that to a certain extent. But that really is the bottom line on any kind of agency.    I am bothered sometimes when I hear you say: Well, if we just had a little more money we would have collected more revenue. If you listen to GAO, they will tell you: You give us an extra dollar and we will save you $69. And I always say: What if we gave you a trillion dollars, would you save $69 trillion? And I know you are not saying that, but just keep that in mind.    Mr. Crenshaw. We collect more revenue with less dollars, but make sure we are spending our money in the right places to keep that collection going.    Mr. Crenshaw. I understand that. I would just encourage you to, if you know that is there, then you ought to find money in other places. That seems to be an important function, and if you do that more efficiently you will get the money.    Mr. Crenshaw. I just want to encourage you to make that a priority. You have a lot of money, you spend it in a lot of different places, and I know everything is important, but some are more important.    Mr. Crenshaw. And you are collecting more revenue.    Mr. Crenshaw. But it is more than you had 5 years ago.    Mr. Crenshaw. No, but I guess you could argue, if you collect more revenue with less money, then maybe if you had even less money you would collect even more revenue. But I think there are other factors, we all agree, that go into that.    Mr. Crenshaw. We don't want to see that happen. I am with you 100 percent.    Mr. Crenshaw. OK. Mr. Serrano has a parting comment.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Amodei, do you have anything further?    Mr. Crenshaw. Yes.                                        Tuesday, February 23, 2016.    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, good afternoon, everybody.    This hearing will come to order.    Today, we will hear from the OMB Director, Shaun Donovan, who has the dubious distinction of submitting for the first time in our Nation's history a $4 trillion budget.    This record level of spending corresponds with a record level of revenue; however, it still isn't enough to balance the budget. So another $600 billion is added to the Federal debt, which, in gross terms, now exceeds $20 trillion for the first time. It took 233 years to incur the first $10 trillion in debt, and it took only 8 short years to incur the next $10 trillion in debt.    Now, the only way to retire the Federal debt is for spending as a percentage of GDP to be lower than its historical average and for revenue as a percentage of GDP to be higher than its historical revenue. The budget before us, however, projects that both spending and revenue as a percentage of GDP will remain above their historical average through 2026. In other words, this budget is a permanent source of debt.    As a percentage of GDP, gross debt hovers around 105 percent. Now, that is a level that has not been seen or tolerated since the end of World War II. And I think we would all be a little afraid if the country became acclimated to this level of debt.    So make no mistake, it is an economic burden that threatens the living standards of future generations. As such, I am disappointed that the administration's final budget request to Congress did not propose any substantive entitlement reforms to prevent any further intergenerational inequity, let alone not one substantial entitlement reform in the last 8 years. Back in 2000, there was talk about retiring the Federal debt by 2013, and now the Federal debt has eclipsed our GDP.    Now, the Office of Management and Budget has the great responsibility of constructing a budget that reflects the President's vision for our country. And because of this responsibility, I believe OMB has an even greater responsibility to be judicious and deliberate with its own budget request. And so, today, I hope not only to have an informative discussion about OMB's appropriations request but also to dive into some of the important policies and assumptions included in the President's overall request.    For fiscal year 2017, OMB is requesting a 6-percent increase over last year's level. That is just a little bit under $101 million. In addition, the budget requests a significant increase for OMB's IT account, at 17 percent over last year.    Now, I appreciate the strides the administration has made to improve the use of IT resources all across the government to increase efficiency, to reduce waste, and identify savings. However, at a time where our Nation is incurring significant debt for generations to come, I think OMB should be exercising even greater fiscal restraint.    And may I remind the Director that when the President first took office in 2008 OMB received $78 million. Therefore, I believe your agency, again, has a greater duty to lead by example and to live within the means of your own budget.    I would also like to discuss the role OMB has in strengthening Federal cybersecurity and the steps the Federal Government is taking to prevent the kind of IT failure we saw with the breaches of OPM's background security and personnel database. More and more, we are seeing threats to our national security via cyber attacks on our networks and operating systems. OMB's role in guiding and coordinating cyber policy is very, very important.    Today, I hope we can talk about the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary standard rule. As you know, last month, the Department of Labor submitted its rule to redefine fiduciary standards to OMB for its mandatory review. I will have some questions about this because OMB has the critical task of reviewing all the Federal regulations to ensure all proposed regulations keep pace with modern technology, promote the changing needs of society, and avoid duplicative and inconsistent policies.    I believe the Department of Labor's rule will significantly harm low- and middle-income investors seeking financial advice regarding their retirement and will cause unintended consequences to many Americans' IRA accounts by limiting their access to investment advice provided to many small account holders. At a time when many Americans lack adequate retirement savings, we should be empowering families to save more for retirement by preserving access to all forms of affordable investment advice.    And, finally, I want to talk some today about the administration's inadequate proposal to fund the Army Corps of Engineers. I am very disappointed the administration chose to ignore the importance of our Nation's ports and waterways. As we move toward larger post-Panamax ships, ensuring that ports are dredged deep enough to handle these larger ships is essential to secure America's place in a global competitive market.    For instance, in Jacksonville, Florida, my home district, JAXPORT, our local port, is a major economic driver in the community. JAXPORT supports more than 132,000 jobs and has an economic impact of about $27 billion in the northeast Florida region. And, unfortunately, the President's budget not only cut the Army Corps of Engineers' funding by 22 percent, but it doesn't fund a single new deep draft navigation project.    In order to modernize our Federal navigation channels, we need a budget that reflects the needs of our Nation's ports. And so I am hoping to hear from you, Director, today on why the administration woefully underfunded the Army Corps of Engineers and about the decision to fund only one new start project in the 2017 budget request.    But, again, I want to thank you, Director Donovan, for taking the time to be with us today, and I look forward to your testimony.    And now I would like to turn to the ranking member, Mr. Serrano, for any opening remarks he might have.    Mr. Crenshaw. Yeah, I said something nice about the IT stuff.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    I would like now to yield to Mr. Rogers, who is the chairman of the full committee, for any opening statement he might like to make.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    And now, Director Donovan, we will turn to you for your testimony. If you could keep it in the 5-minute range, that will allow more time for questions. And your full statement will be made part of the record. So the floor is yours.    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, thank you.    Let me ask you about your budget request of a little over $100 million. You got an increase last year. You are asking for a 6-percent increase this year.    As I understand it, your role is to say to the agencies what you ought to be asking money for and not spending yourself. I mean, you oversee the overall budget, and that is why I said earlier I think you have a particular responsibility in terms of fiscal restraint.    I know when I was chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee of this full committee, I cut the Members' office accounts by 10 percent. It was a tough decision, but I thought we ought to lead by example. And if you look over the last 5 years, the budget of the House of Representatives has gone down by 16 percent.    And so when you ask for a 6-percent increase, I look at the request, and I think last year part of that increase was going to go for 25 new staffers and now, for 2017, another 10 new staff positions. Can you tell me how many of the 25 from last year's appropriation have been hired?    Mr. Crenshaw. So the 25 that we funded last year, they have all been hired?    Mr. Crenshaw. Okay.    Mr. Crenshaw. And then you need 10 more for next year, and you have roles for them to play.    Mr. Crenshaw. I gotcha.    Mr. Crenshaw. You hired that first 25 pretty quick. And, you know, if you have the money to do it, you did it, and that is good.    Mr. Crenshaw. Gotcha.    Let me ask you a quick question about some of the work you do when you oversee all the different regulations that come before you. And, in particular, I mentioned in my opening statement the Department of Labor and the fiduciary standard.    As you know, we had this conversation last year, I believe the SEC, which we oversee and fund here, has the primary responsibility to look at our economy and make sure that things are safe and stable. And it seems like they would be the appropriate people to make a rule or regulation about fiduciary standards. In fact, when we asked Mary Jo White at the hearing, she said they are working on a rule to do that.    It seems like the Department of Labor has kind of just ignored everybody's input to say, you know, let's not duplicate, let's not make things overlap, and yet they just keep going, and keep going. They have heard from the Department of Treasury, they have heard from the different appropriators, different subcommittees, full committees.    And I guess the question is, if they are just going to kind of keep moving--then they come to you, and you have to ultimately review that. And my understanding is that you are going to expedite that review, and there might be a final rule sometime in April.    And so the question becomes, do you sit down and do a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis to make sure that--we all want to help investors. We all understand that with the stock market there are certain risks involved. So we want to help, but we don't want to help in a way that cuts off people's access to investment advice.    So before you kind of finalize that rule, do you do a cost-benefit analysis?    Mr. Crenshaw. So can you assure us that there is not going to be duplication or inconsistencies if you have a rule by the SEC and a rule by Department of Labor?    Mr. Crenshaw. And how do you go about making sure this proposed rule isn't going to have unintended consequences, and actually limit people's access, not adversely affect particularly some of the low- and middle-income Americans? How do you go about the process to make that determination?    Mr. Crenshaw. And I guess you know there have been a lot of concerns--anytime you have a comment period, some people like it, some people don't--but there have been a lot of concerns raised, and not on a partisan basis, kind of across the board, people are just concerned that you don't overdo the regulation to really harm the people you are trying to help. So I just hope that you will continue to keep that in mind.    And, again, when we have the SEC Chairman before us, we will ask her how she's doing on her rule. Because, again, we don't want to see the inconsistencies, duplication that just create even more confusion.    Mr. Crenshaw. Can you tell us whether or not you are expediting the rule and when the final rule might be available? Or is that something you are not supposed to comment on?    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you very much.    Mr. Serrano.    Mr. Crenshaw. Just real quick, do you have a number, like, how much money the Federal Government spends every year across the board on IT?    Mr. Crenshaw. That is all?    Mr. Rogers.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    We have been joined by the ranking member of the full committee, Mrs. Lowey. And so I am going to recognize her to either make an opening statement and/or ask a question or a combination thereof.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Crenshaw. Now we will turn to Mr. Womack.    Mr. Crenshaw. About $600 billion.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    We will have time for another round of questions, but now let's turn to Mr. Quigley.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Graves.    Mr. Crenshaw. I think what he is asking is what areas of the market failure led the administration to propose this rule. I mean, if you think about that, it sounds like one of those solutions looking for a problem. But you think that through.    Let's turn now to Mr. Yoder.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Now we will turn to Mr. Rigell.    Mr. Crenshaw. Certainly. And that doesn't count against your time.    Mr. Crenshaw. And if you feel like talking loud, that is--I don't think the Director----    Mr. Crenshaw. And I can talk loud too.    Mr. Crenshaw. And just for the record, Mr. Rigell always talks pretty loud.    Mr. Crenshaw. We will have time. We will have time. I hope you all stick around. We will have another round of questions, but let me interrupt that for a second.    I will say, as I have said in opening statement, Director, people look and they see it took 233 years to get to the point where we are $10 trillion, that is our national debt. And then they can look and see, the last 8 years, we added $10 trillion to our debt. I mean, those are things that people understand. And I think we are all trying to figure out a way forward--that is not good place to be.    But let me ask you two quick questions about the budget. As I mentioned in my opening statement, you cut the Corps of Engineers by 22 percent. And as I pointed out, too, that most of the cargo internationally goes through our ports. We have these post-Panamax ships. They are bigger, they draw more, and so our ports need to deepen their waterways to compete internationally.    And so I guess the question is, why did the administration propose a 22-percent reduction over the Army Corps' last year's budget? And why is there a reduction of $800 million or about 40 percent for these construction accounts? And those are the ones that fund our ports. So can you tell us what went into your thinking?    Mr. Crenshaw. So the one new start this year, six last year, one this year, is this just kind of a matter of priority in terms of not enough money to go around?    Mr. Crenshaw. What are the criteria--what do you look at when you decide what makes a new start? What do you look for? Like, on that one new start you suggest, what went into your thinking to make that decision?    Mr. Crenshaw. Gotcha.    And switching gears real quick, some agencies of the Federal Government get funded through mandatory appropriations, they are not subject to review by the full Appropriations Committee, like, I guess, the OCC and this new agency, the     And I wonder, how vigorously does OMB look at those budgets that aren't annually reviewed by the Approps Committee? Do you look at those?    Mr. Crenshaw. Have you ever cut some of those mandatory--well, like, let's talk about the CFPB because that is kind of what I was focusing on.    They get a check from the Fed for $600 million. They were set up purposefully outside our appropriations process. But somebody did an independent performance audit for the CFPB, and they recommended that the Bureau expand transparency of their funding and expenditures.    Now, do you think that is a good analysis? Some of these that are funded mandatorily, do you think they ought to be a little more open and transparent?    Mr. Crenshaw. So you never look at that one?    Mr. Crenshaw. OK.    Mr. Crenshaw. And when you do, do you look at their transparency of their funding and their expenditures, even though we----    Mr. Crenshaw . Don't, because we are not allowed to. Even though CFPB is not one of those. I guess OCC might be.    Mr. Crenshaw. But the CFPB is not one of those agencies that is funded outside of the appropriations process that you oversee----    Mr. Crenshaw. And that is not an area that you oversee?    Mr. Crenshaw. OK. Well, thank you.    Let's go now to Mr. Serrano, quietly.    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, thank you, Mr. Serrano. And I think we all feel like we are lucky to be Americans. And I think we all know that government needs money to provide services. But sometimes we have to be efficient and we have to make hard choices. And I am sure there are a couple more questions. And my observation is, we have worked together, and the Director knows there is disagreement on a lot of different issues, whether it is talking about the budget or whether it is talking about the fence or whatever.    So I hope nobody is kind of--one of the problems in today's world sometimes is when people disagree, they tend to demonize the person they disagree with. And I don't hear any of that today. And I don't think that is a good thing. So I think we have had a spirited discussion. We will keep on having a spirited discussion.    So I will recognize Mr. Womack. If he would like to be recognized.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Graves is recognized.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Yoder.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Serrano, do you have any closing comments?    Mr. Crenshaw. And I would just add my words of thanks to your commitment to public service, and we appreciate you being here today. That is what the legislative process is all about, a give-and-take. And just appreciate your spirit and the hard job that you have. So we look forward to continuing to work with you as best we can to make this a better place for all of us.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you very much.                                           Tuesday, March 22, 2016.    Mr. Crenshaw. The hearing will come to order. The ranking member. Mr. Serrano, has tweeted that the meeting will start 11:00 promptly, and I know people are anxiously reading his tweet at this point, so we will start.    This is the final hearing of our subcommittee, so I want to welcome our witness, the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, Mary Jo White. Thank you for being here today. We always enjoy having you before our subcommittee. I know the subcommittee members look forward to having a good exchange with you.    The SEC plays a critical role in protecting investors, encouraging capital formation, and maintaining fair and efficient markets, just as buyers and sellers expect the U.S. markets to be fair and efficient, the regulator who oversees them is expected to be fair and efficient as well. For fiscal year 2017, the SEC is requesting $1.781 billion, which is $176 million, or an 11 percent increase over fiscal year 2016.    While the SEC is a fee-funded agency, congressional oversight over the Commission is essential in holding the SEC accountable in fulfilling its mission, and making sure that it is responsive to the markets and investors, as well as congressional concerns.    I look forward to discussing your request, and why the Commission believes it needs these additional fundings. For the past 3 years, the Committee has set aside resources within the overall SEC funding amount to fully fund the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, the so-called DERA. In that time, the funds this Committee provided have given DERA the ability to grow by almost 50 positions, including 16 PhD economists. And I happen to believe that cost-benefit analysis of SEC rulemakings is very, very informative, and I support the work that DERA does to educate the Commission about the macro, as well as the micro, economic effects of SEC rulemakings. So, I want to express my support for other DERA functions, such as developing risk-based models for the Commission's inspections and enforcement divisions.    In addition to your duties as chair of the SEC, you are also a member of the Financial Stability and Oversight Council, the so-called FSOC, and I know we discussed this a bit last year, but the designation process for systemically important financial institutions, SIFIs, still is a concern for me.    Although FSOC has adopted some transparency measures since we last spoke, I am not sure that they go far enough. In addition, I still believe the current designation process is not flexible enough. Entities should be given the opportunity to address systemic risk before being designated. FSOC's success should be measured by how it mitigates systemic risk, not by the number of institutions it designates.    Another issue that we discussed last year was liquidity in the markets, especially in the fixed income markets. As I am sure you know, the fiscal year 2016 omnibus required DERA to report back to the committee within one year of enactment, on the combined impact of the Volcker rule, Basel III, and other financial regulations, and the impact they have had on access to capital for consumers, investors, businesses, and on market liquidity.    I continue to have concerns that the cumulative effect of these layers of regulations has adversely impacted overall market conditions and market liquidity. So, I look forward to reading the report and discussing with you today what the SEC is doing to address this issue.    The 2016 omnibus also included a provision which prohibits the SEC from finalizing, issuing, or implementing any rule or order regarding the disclosure of political contributions in the SEC filings. I believe Congress has been very clear on this issue. However, I understand that there are some who believe the SEC is still able to work on a potential rule without actually finalizing that rule. Let me just caution you against this interpretation.    I think the Commission has a lot of work to do, including Congressionally mandated work that is more important than advancing a policy that Congress has never actually required, and in fact, has plainly rejected in statute.    On a bipartisan note, last month, the House passed H.R. 3784, that is called the SEC Small Business Advocate Act. Mr. Quigley and I were sponsors of the bill, and I hope the Senate takes up this legislation soon, because small businesses are on the forefront of job creation and technology innovation. The SEC's Small Business Advocate Act establishes an Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation, and the Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee, to assist small businesses and small businesses' investors with any problems that they may have with the Commission, identify difficulties small businesses have in securing access to capital, including unique challenges for minority and women-owned businesses, analyzing the potential impact of SEC regulations on small businesses, and propose changes to SEC regulations which would better promote the interests and needs of small businesses and their investors.    I am interested to hear from you, Chair White, on how the SEC is currently making small businesses and small businesses' capital formation a priority, and any thoughts you might have on this bipartisan legislation.    The SEC should be one of the leaders in helping further grow our economy, while at the same time keeping our markets fair and orderly. That is an important responsibility, and I know that you take it very seriously. We thank you for the work that you do, and the staff for the work that they do. We look forward to your testimony today, but first, I am going to turn to Mr. Serrano, the ranking member, for any comments he might make.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. Now, we will turn to Chair White for your opening statement. If you could keep it in the range of 5 minutes, that will give us plenty of time to answer questions.    So, the floor is yours.    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, thank you very much. We will start the questions now, and we will try to observe the 5 minute rule, though there will be some members coming and going--there are other hearings going on at this very moment. Some are right across the hall; some are right down the hall.    But let me start by just asking you about your budget this year, a requested increase of $176 million. And I mentioned that is an 11 percent increase over last year. Last year, you received a $105 million of an increase, which is $281 million over 2 years. But from 2015 to 2016, there was $51 million in carryover. I wonder how that happened, and how that works when you also have access to a reserve fund that was set up under Dodd-Frank. Just talk about the funding over the last 2 years, and that $51 million. How does that occur, and what do you plan to do with that $51 million?    Mr. Crenshaw. I got you. And last year, you received a $105 million increase, but it was less than you requested. I think $117 million less than that. So, when you do not get as much as you ask for, how do you prioritize--of that $105, what will your--I know you have done a lot of work in enforcement investigations. But when you do not have as much as you had requested, tell us a little bit about how the priorities were with the money you did receive, including from last year.    Mr. Crenshaw. Got it. You mentioned DERA, and I mentioned in my opening statement that we have carved out money for that division. We think that is important in terms of understanding the cost-benefit analysis, and I want to get you to comment on that. How has that worked out? I mean, has that been helpful, across the board, in assisting what you do?    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, thank you. I am glad to hear that. One of the things that we asked last year in the omnibus bill is for them to do a study, and report back to us because I think there is some concern that there is an awful lot of regulation. I mentioned in my opening statement that you have Basel III, and this, that, lots of regulations. And there is some concern among folks that there layers of regulations have impacted the liquidity of the markets.    So, we ask for a report to see what they would have to say, and I am looking forward to reading that report, but do you think some of those regulations--if there is a lack of liquidity, was that an unintended consequence, or do you think that was part of the plan in cooling down the economy, or heating it up, based on your view of what happened in 2008?    Mr. Crenshaw. So, it is a concern, and it sounds to me like you all have looked at that from time and time, and I think this study will give us even more information about that. Do you ever talk about what is the appropriate liquidity level? I mean, you cannot really pin that down, but it is something you all talk about as you look at the markets?    Mr. Crenshaw. Got it. OK. Now, let's turn to Mr. Serrano.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. I am going to turn now to Mr. Graves, and then Mr. Quigley, but I wanted to note that we have been joined by the ranking member of the full committee, Mrs. Lowey, and she will be here to ask a question or two along the way. So, welcome. Mr. Graves.    Mr. Crenshaw. And just on that, as I understand it, Dodd-Frank specifically said, your agency was mandated to study the issue, and to propose a rule. Do you have any idea why the Administration has supported the DOL moving ahead of you?    Mr. Crenshaw. But, is the SEC going to look into developing their own rule?    Mr. Crenshaw. And who is going to figure out how to harmonize the two rules?    Mr. Crenshaw. Got it. Thank you. Mr. Quigley.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. Mr. Amodei.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. And I think we will have time for another round of questions. But now let me turn to Mrs. Lowey for either a statement or a question, or both.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. Mr. Yoder, and then Mr. Bishop.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. Mr. Bishop, and then Mr. Womack.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. Mr. Womack.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. We have time for another question or two. I will start. You and I talked, I think last year, about FSOC. And I mentioned you are a member of FSOC. It is a relatively new agency. One of my concerns has always been the transparency involved in the designations. I think it is fair to say if there are systemically important financial institutions, and they are designated as such, they have additional burdens, et cetera. It seemed initially that the goal was to designate institutions as opposed to mitigate the risk involved with institutions.    And so my first question is: Would you agree with me that it would be more important to mitigate the risk to our system and that you ought to judge the success of that by the mitigation of risk as opposed to the number of designations that are made?    Mr. Crenshaw. Let me ask you about the designations. There is some question that it seems like the big banks all got designated. Is that based on their size or based on their activity?    Mr. Crenshaw. I do not know if you are familiar, but last year at our full committee markup, I offered an amendment that I wanted to be sure everybody on the committee got to look at and discuss, and it was kind of an off-ramp, a way for companies to de-risk prior to designation, particularly the non-banks, the asset managers, or insurance companies. It did not preclude FSOC from designating them, but it gave them an opportunity to be notified. Here is a problem with your business model. Can you tell us how you might cure it?    And still, if FSOC felt like that did not solve the problem, did not mitigate the risk enough, the designation could still occur. That seems like a commonsense, reasonable approach. I am wondering if that would simply add some flexibility, because again, the goal is not just to--and I know there have not been that many designations--but the goal is not to go out and find people to designate them. The goal is to keep our financial system safe, secure, orderly, et cetera. So, did you see that language? And what are your thoughts about that kind of flexibility?    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, it is good to hear the process is becoming a little more transparent. Particularly when you get into the question of whether the designation is based on size or based on activities. When you move away from large banks, like asset managers, for instance, they are very large, but in terms of their activity, you can argue about how much systemic risk occurs when you are managing somebody else's money.    But, I think we will continue to have that dialogue, because as you point out, even at the end, to say if maybe we mitigated enough risk, they do not need to be designated specifically anymore, but at the front end, it might be appropriate to give more understanding to what the activities are, what the size is, before that designation occurs. So, I am encouraged to hear your thoughts on that. Mr. Serrano, do you have a question?    Mr. Crenshaw. Mr. Bishop is recognized.    Mr. Crenshaw. Well thank you, Chair White. We want to thank you for your service. I think everyone on this subcommittee appreciates the work you are doing. It is a big job, lots of responsibility, and we know how seriously you take that. So thank you for that, and we look forward to continuing to work with you so that you have the resources to do your job. So, thank you very much. This meeting is adjourned.                         Wednesday, March 16, 2016.    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, if everybody is ready, we will get started. This hearing will come to order. Good morning. I would like to welcome our witness, Secretary Jack Lew, Secretary of the Treasury.    Today, we look forward to discussing the Department's own budget request, as well as, some of the assumptions and policies included in the President's overall request for fiscal year 2017.    Last month, we had a very loud discussion with OMB Director Shaun Donovan about the debt generated by the President's budget. While there is more than one way to measure the size and the effect of debt on the economy, in the simplest terms, the President's budget spends more than it takes in, and that results in more debt.    This debt is an economic burden that must be repaid by our grandchildren and their grandchildren because the President's final budget does not address the unavoidable question of how to distribute the economic cost of an aging population across the generations.    The Federal debt, in gross terms, exceeds $20 trillion for the first time in our Nation's history. It took 233 years to get to this first $10 trillion in debt, and it only took 8 years to get to the next $10 trillion. And because of this, Mr. Secretary, I wanted you to think back to your first tenure as the OMB director, when you predicted that the United States would be debt free by 2013.    Now, obviously, a lot has changed since then, but the formula for retiring debt has not. Spending as a percentage of GDP must be lower than its historical average, and revenue as a percentage of GDP must be higher than its historical average. The budget before us, however, projects that both spending and revenue, as a percentage of GDP, will remain above the historical averages through 2026. In other words, this budget is a permanent source of debt.    Growing along with the debt is Treasury's own budget request for the fiscal year 2017. The Treasury Department is requesting a massive 12 percent increase, including $1 billion, or a 9 percent increase for the IRS. Instead of making some tough choices, it seems that Treasury proposes unrealistic increases, budget gimmicks, and new mandatory spending.    I believe the IRS request is unrealistic. They have not received either a dollar or a percentage increase of that magnitude in the last 20 years. The IRS request assumes a discretionary cap adjustment that the budget committees have rejected for 5 consecutive years.    In addition, the Treasury seeks to spend an additional $8.5 billion outside of the appropriations process. The request also proposes a new cybersecurity enhancement account to the tune of $110 million. Without a doubt, cyber threats are real and they are serious, and the committee has been continually supportive of funding for cybersecurity as a part of the agency's annual budget request. However, I would caution the administration against the temptation to create an endless number of new accounts across government spending, and calling that a cybersecurity plan in order to get new funding for an old problem.    Make no mistake, we must harden our Nation's information technology infrastructure, but it should be done with a critical eye. New programs with new names aren't going to solve the Federal Government's perpetually out-of-date, over budget, behind schedule, information technology.    I hope, with further discussion today, we can find some common ground to work on together. As you know, a matter of great interest to me, and concern to me, is the Financial Stability Oversight Council's process for designating systemically important financial institutions and, in particular, nonbanks.    Following up on our conversation from last year, I hope we can shed some light on how FSOC has improved transparency with regard to entities under consideration for SIFI designation as we adopted last year.    Another issue that was important, I would like to bring to your attention, is that in the 2016 Omnibus, we required the SEC's division of economic and risk analysis to report back to this committee within a year of enactment on the combined impact of the Volcker rule, Basel III, and other financial regulations, what kind of impact they have had on access to capital for consumers, investors, and businesses, and the impact on market liquidity.    I look forward to reading that report later this year, but in the meantime, I hope we can talk a little bit about how you will work with the SEC economists, if and when asked. I have serious concerns that the cumulative effect, of these layers of regulations, have resulted in an alarming lack of liquidity in U.S. markets, particularly in fixed income markets.    I believe we need to continue to monitor this issue closely, and I look forward to discussing these concerns with you today.    And finally, let me say one thing about the Omnibus last year. We included an additional $5 million for Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. That was to expedite the label and formula processing. And I believe that by appropriating these funds for the Bureau, we can help countless small businesses that depend on the Treasury for approval of their labels and formulas to get their products to market.    Mr. Secretary, I hope this funding makes it clear that this is a priority for Congress. I know it is a priority of our full committee's chairman, and I hope the Department will assist the Bureau in accomplishing their mission.    So again, I want to thank you for taking the time to meet with us, Secretary Lew. I look forward to your testimony, but first let me turn to the ranking member, Mr. Serrano, for any opening statement he might make.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. And our chairman of the full committee, Mr. Rogers, is en route, and when he arrives, if he wants to make an opening statement, we will recognize him.    But right now, Mr. Secretary, we recognize you for your opening statement. If you could keep your remarks in the neighborhood of 5 minutes and you can submit your full statement for the record, but please proceed.    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, thank you, sir. And we will start with the questions, and we will observe the 5-minute rule if we can, just so we can have everybody ask a series of questions. And I think we will have time for another round after that.    But let me start, Mr. Secretary. I mentioned in my opening statement about this new agency called FSOC, which you are the chairman of, and as you and I talked last year about one of my concerns that there is not a lot of transparency in this whole designation process, and I think your point last year was, well, it is really--it is kind of a binary decision. We either designate somebody or we don't designate somebody.    And I guess the question becomes, isn't it more important to mitigate the risk than it is to simply designate someone. And so this subcommittee, last year, adopted some language that I proposed to say, before you go out and designate someone, you would maybe let them know what FSOC thought the potential problem was, give them an opportunity to understand what the problem is, and give them an opportunity to actually derisk or cure that problem, and still, FSOC would have the final authority as to whether to designate that institution as a SIFI or not.    And particularly in terms of nonbanks. It is understandable, more so, in the big banks, the Too Big to Fail concept, I think that is what gave rise to this whole SIFI designation, but when you get into nonbanks, life insurance companies, or asset managers, this lack of transparency is still a concern, I think, to me and to this subcommittee.    So talk a little bit about that. I mean, isn't it more important? We want to have an economy, we want to have capital markets that are safe and secure, and that is more important, mitigating the risk there than simply designating people either SIFI or not a SIFI. Wouldn't you agree that that really is the goal?    Mr. Crenshaw. You mentioned that you are having those conversations, and particularly, in terms of the nonbanks, and there was, I know life insurance companies have been designated. There was some concern that some of the asset managers, and the question would become, what risk they posed overall, in terms of there are other people's money that is being invested. They don't seem to pose the same kind of risk, but if you are having those kinds of conversations, do you agree that the language we added last year, does that make sense that as you move forward in these discussions, that you would come to a point where you would give credence to that language to say we will sit down with you, if you are having those discussions.    And if these are areas of concern, I want to make you aware, Mr. Institution, of those concerns, give you an opportunity to look at them and say, maybe we can help mitigate that risk, and if so, does that make sense to have that kind of process so that before you just designate them, you at least let them know--it sounds like you are trying to do that now.    Mr. Crenshaw. But why not codify that so that it gives them some--I guess some comfort, that they are just not going to wake up one morning and somebody says, well, you are now a     Mr. Crenshaw. Well, it seems like then, we tend to agree, that it gives you, both FSOC and the institution, an opportunity to mitigate that risk. Now, it sounds to me like that is what you would like to see happen. You may not want to write that down, but that is what you are doing today, and again, it is important to mitigate risk, not just to designate. You would say, look, if you can mitigate the risk, that is probably better than just getting designated and staying there forever, which brings up another question, just very briefly.    After somebody has been designated a SIFI, is there any way to get undesignated a SIFI?    Mr. Crenshaw. Because once again, it seems to me, from your standpoint, as the regulator, what you would want to do is to say if there is some risk involved, we want to tell you about it, we will designate you, but we would really rather you mitigate the risk and not be designated, and so I wonder, will there ever be a way to get undesignated if all the mitigation takes place and the risk has gone away?    Mr. Crenshaw. Has anybody ever been undesignated?    Mr. Crenshaw. I am encouraged to hear that I think when FSOC got created and you became the chairman, nobody knew exactly what was going to happen. And I think some of the early indications, early actions were that all you can do is say yes or no, and now it sounds to me like there is an evolution of a process, and we are just trying to help bring that along. And if the proposal is to write that down, that doesn't get in the way of the overall regulation. We hope we can move in that direction. So thank you for that.    And now I would like to turn to Mr. Serrano.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. Mr. Yoder is recognized.    Mr. Crenshaw. And I think you know, we expect you to do this, and we appreciate it.    Mr. Quigley.    Mr. Crenshaw. Before we turn to Mr. Amodei, we have been joined by the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Rogers, and I would like to ask him if he would like to make a statement.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Chairman Rogers. And now let's turn to Mr. Amodei, and after that Mr. Rigell.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Rigell.    Mr. Crenshaw. Please.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    And now I would like to recognize Ms. Herrera Beutler.    And we are glad to see you back, your smiling face.    She has been dealing with some family health issues.    And we welcome you. And please proceed.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Graves.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Now I would like to turn to Chairman Rogers for a question or two.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    We have got a few minutes left. I have a couple more questions. I think Mr. Serrano might, too.    So let me ask you, Mr. Secretary I mentioned in my opening statement my concern about the lack-of-liquidity in the economy. After the crisis, an awful lot of new rules and regulations were put into effect, and I have always had a concern that they might somehow impact this liquidity issue that deals with our economy. A lot of other people have that same concern. Just recently, I think, a couple of members of the Fed said they believe there is a linkage between the post-crisis regulatory framework and liquidity.    So my first question is, do you think that was by design or do you think that was an unintended consequence?    Mr. Crenshaw. Because that is really what I am talking about, wild market fluctuations. You hear Mr. Amodei talk about the community banks going out of business.    Most people, maybe not everybody, but if you got people in the Fed saying: Look, I think there is a linkage here when you have got all this new regulation, and clearly there is a little bit of lack of liquidity just in everyday business startups, things like that. And you might say: Well, I don't see the linkage and I don't----    Mr. Crenshaw. And that is what I was going to ask you, because if you don't think that that really is impacting, maybe--you said you have done some studies. As I mentioned in my opening statement, we asked the SEC to do a study, and they might coordinate with you, but it would be interesting to see what the results of a more formal study would produce in terms of lack of liquidity. So you would say, A, I am not sure that there is a linkage, and, B, then you would certainly say----    Mr. Crenshaw. No, but you don't think anybody sat in a room and said: Look, if we do all these new regulations, we can take some of the liquidity out of the market. Nobody thought----    Mr. Crenshaw. No, no. When you all sit down and talk about liquidity, what would you argue is the right mix of liquidity?    Mr. Crenshaw. But also in business startups, small banks, all the lending, it seems to me you hear a lot that these community banks are all going out of business, big banks are getting bigger, but it is harder and harder for somebody to go start a business or buy a home. It seems to me that has some sort of impact, and maybe that is at a lower level than you look at.    Mr. Crenshaw. I am glad to hear you say that--it would seem fairly obvious--that you are concerned about liquidity in the market.    Mr. Crenshaw. Exactly. I think we all want to say we want reasonable regulation, but we want to be careful that if too much regulation creates problems, then we want to be sensitive to that. Not enough regulation also creates problems. There is a balance somewhere.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. Thank you.    Mr. Serrano.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Yoder has another question or two.    Mr. Crenshaw. Yeah. We can fix the tax code. That is the way we will stop it, right?    Go ahead. I have a question, but you have a comment?    Mr. Crenshaw. Let me ask one final question, Mr. Secretary, about mandatory spending, because I know, your agency has a lot of bureaus that are funded through mandatory funding that are outside the appropriations process. And I understand, that FSOC, which we have talked a lot about, are going to have a 23 percent increase in their budget. And so I wanted to ask you why you think that is.    But in a broader sense, I read a report that said this new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had an independent performance audit and it was recommended that the CFPB expand their transparency of their funding and expenditures, which kind of brings up that broader question about these agencies that aren't under the appropriations process: how much scrutiny goes into those budgets? For instance, it used to be the OMB Director.    I wonder in those days how much attention did you pay or does the OMB today pay to some of those agencies that are funded outside the appropriations process. What kind of critical review do they get? Can you talk a little bit about that? Because I think that is a concern to everybody.    For instance, that 23 percent increase, you say, well, tell us about that. But in general, since they are not under the process that the public sees with every other agency, are you comfortable with the amount of scrutiny they get before they spend the dollars that they spend even though they are mandatory?    Mr. Crenshaw. Great. Well, thank you very much. And I think--Mr. Graves has no more questions.    Again, I want to thank you personally for your long career in government. Not that you are going away, I know you are going to the Bronx, you may come back. But thank you for your service to the country. Thank you for working with us. And we look forward to continuing to work together to make things better in this country.    Mr. Crenshaw. So, again, thank you so much.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    This meeting is adjourned.
