    Secretary Pritzker. Thank you very much.    Chairman Culberson, Ranking Member Fattah, and Members of the committee when they arrive, thank you for this opportunity to lay out the priorities of President Obama's fiscal year 2016 budget for the Department of Commerce.    This budget advances the core tenets of our department's mission which are to develop and implement policies that support economic growth, enhance our country's competitiveness and global leadership, as well as strengthen America's businesses both at home and abroad.    To support this mission, the fiscal year 2016 budget provides $9.8 billion in discretionary funding to reinforce the priorities of the department's strategy, our open for business agenda, by promoting U.S. exports, trade and investment, by spurring high-tech manufacturing and innovation, by unleashing more data for economic benefit, by gathering and acting on environmental intelligence, and by making our agencies' operations more efficient and effective.    Today I want to highlight some key initiatives supported by this budget. First the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau creates data products used by businesses, policymakers, and the public.    And this budget reflects the fact that this is a critical year for preparation of the 2020 census as we test the use of administrative records, re-engineered field operations and Internet data collection, create new systems to improve the quality of the census and develop plans so that in fiscal year 2017 and 2018, we can conduct an integrity test of the entire process, all leading to a potential savings of $5 billion to taxpayers. To achieve these savings, we must invest today.    Another part of our agenda is to help communities and businesses prosper in a changing environment. NOAA's budget will enhance our ability to meet this goal through two investments.    First, the budget proposes $2.4 billion to fully fund the next generation of weather and environmental satellites. Funding the development and launch of future satellites is absolutely critical to reduce the risk of a potential gap in the weather data in 2017 and beyond.    Second, the budget requests $147 million to develop a high-endurance, long-range ocean survey vessel. Immediate action is necessary to maintain our critical ocean observing capabilities. Making this investment this year will enable NOAA to take advantage of the navy's design work and project management team which will save taxpayers millions of dollars in acquisition and design costs.    For generations, manufacturing has been a key to U.S. innovation, a source of middle class jobs and a pillar of our global leadership. Over the last five years, America's manufacturers have added more than 870,000 jobs, growing for the first time in decades.    Recognizing the importance of manufacturing to our competitiveness, Congress passed the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act which calls for the expansion of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation or NNMI.    This initiative brings together industry, university researchers, community colleges, NGOs, and government to accelerate the development of cutting-edge manufacturing technologies.    Our fiscal year 2016 budget requests funding first to support and coordinate current and future NNMI institutes and second to support two institutes led by the Commerce Department which would focus on manufacturing technologies that industry determines have the most potential.    This budget will also provide the International Trade Administration with the resources needed to advance President Obama's robust trade agenda and to help U.S. businesses expand their exports and reach the 95 percent of customers outside of the United States.    Finally, our budget requests $24 million for the renovation of the department's headquarters to enable us to make better use of our space and ultimately to reduce the amount of funds required to house our employees.    These priorities only scratch the surface of our department's work to support U.S. businesses, communities, and our economy.    I look forward to answering your questions today and to partnering with this committee to keep America open for business. Thank you.                              2020 census    Secretary Pritzker. I am not sure.    Secretary Pritzker. It is mandatory by statute. I think it is by statute.    Secretary Pritzker. So, Chairman, you know, one of the major efforts that we have with the 2020 census is the use of what we call administrative records, the ability to use other data that has been collected by the Federal Government.    What we need to do in order to take advantage of that information is we have to test the efficacy of using that. And so that is why our request is so significant this year. It is very much about testing.    The 2010 census, as I understand, was pretty much done the way censuses have been done for the prior 30 or 40 years. What we need to do is to transform the way we do the census. And you very much are suggesting that which is that we have more automation and greater use of administrative records. And so we very much want to use other administrative records. What we need to do, though, is test that that will work.    In terms of the American Community Survey, we respect the privacy and time, of the individuals who fill out the American Community Survey as well as the time that we ask people to take to fill out the survey.    It is a survey, though, that is very much used by businesses, by NGOs, by local, state and Federal Government. The VA, for example, is a big user of the American Community Survey. It is the only source of data in many instances for small and rural communities.    So if the ACS were no longer available or no longer used, there is about 60 million Americans that we would not be collecting data on except during the census period.    But recognizing the concern about this survey, I did last year call for complete top to bottom review of the survey, what other sources of information could we be using, how frequently do we have to ask questions, could we ask them less frequently and still have the data be reliable, could we delete questions.    And we are in the process of analyzing that and the answers are due back to me at the latest by the end of the fiscal year.    Secretary Pritzker. I do not know the exact sources of the administrative records that we are allowed to use. And some of that is by statute what we are allowed to use.    Secretary Pritzker. We would anticipate using whatever is available to us. We will have to check whether we can use----    Secretary Pritzker. I do not know, but we will find out. I will get back to you, Mr. Chairman, on whether we can use IRS records. Obviously what we want to do is use whatever administrative data and records are available to us. And there is a whole list that----    Secretary Pritzker . Census is accessing.    Secretary Pritzker. Mr. Chairman, we will get back to you. Privacy is something that we at the Census and we at the Department of Commerce take very, very seriously.    We work very hard to protect the data that we have the privilege of having access to and we work very carefully to make sure that it is being handled in a responsible fashion when we do the things that we are required to do either by statute or by the Constitution.    Secretary Pritzker. So we are in the process of beefing up our systems to be able to handle the volume. But the other thing that we need to do is make sure that we--we are equally as concerned about the issue of verification to make sure that when we send out a survey, a census survey, someone knows that it is us, it is the government, it is the Census Bureau. It is not someone else.    And we also will need to have methodologies to authenticate that the person responding is actually who they say they are.    There is a lot to be dealt with to make sure that this works online well. It brings me back to what is important is that the Census Bureau very much wants to take advantage, as you said, of how do we save money, how do we do this efficiently.    But to do that, we have to invest today. We have to be able to test because if we cannot prove that it is going to work, then we are now allowed by, you know, as I said, what I call the lock-down or the integrity test that will occur in fiscal years 2017 and 2018.    If we cannot prove to the Census folks that this will work, we are not able to do the census that way. Then we go back to the more expensive survey which is sending people to people's houses which seems ridiculous in a digital world.    Secretary Pritzker. No, I understand.    Secretary Pritzker. Congressman, you know that I am as passionate about manufacturing as you are and I view my number one responsibility is to help our economy grow and help our private sector grow because one thing I know from my own experience 27 years in the private sector is that the people who create jobs are the private sector.    And so one of the things you talked about, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, and, as you know, we are re-competing our MEPs at this time and we have just done ten of them, and the reason that we are doing that is and the reason that MEP exists is to help small and medium-size manufacturers.    And if you had told me from the private sector before I had this job that the Federal Government could help you to have better access to technology and processes to manufacture, I was highly skeptical until I went out and actually saw this with my own eyes and, more importantly, talked with owners of businesses who said I would not have been able to adapt the kind of world-class processes that I have access to because of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership.    So these are programs that I think are extremely effective. We have changed the funding match to be one to one so more small businesses can take advantage of it. And it is something that, you know, is really exciting to see the kind of specialized expertise that a small manufacturer can take advantage of.    In terms of other efforts that we have around innovation, whether it is the Centers of Excellence in terms of that NIST has working on disaster resilience or forensic science or advanced materials, these are areas where we work with outside universities to take technologies, move them forward so that they can get out of the laboratory sooner rather than later.    The National Network of Manufacturing Innovation is a continuation of that effort to take ideas that we think can go from lab to market over the next five to seven years, and that is why I was so excited when you all passed the Revitalize American Manufacturing Innovation Act because it is an opportunity for us as a country to really put together our researchers in the universities, our private sector, our local governments, our NGOs, our community colleges and the supply chain and the skilled labor training that can go on in our community colleges to take technologies like lightweight materials or take technologies like photonics or digital manufacturing and really bring them to market.    And the reason we need to do that is we know that a third of our economic growth since 2009 has come from our innovations. And so it is really critical.    Secretary Pritzker. Sorry.    Secretary Pritzker. I would just say I am well aware of this issue.    Secretary Pritzker. And I know it is important to you. And I understand my staff is working with your staff and the committee's staff to try and get this addressed.    Secretary Pritzker. Making sure that we have adequate salmon stocks and that this fish stock is doing well is of great importance to us. What I would ask is that I would probably have my NOAA staff work with yours to explain to you how exactly we believe--we believe this is adequate funding to do what we need to do, but I would like to have them come and work with you so that you can be satisfied about that.    Secretary Pritzker. Terrific. We will look into it and we will work with you.    Secretary Pritzker. Yes. Well Congressman, I too hope that we have immigration reform, comprehensive immigration reform by the time, certainly hopefully before the next 2020 Census. And I assure you we stand ready to be able to handle that regardless of when it comes into fruition. It will not affect the processes that we use, it simply is the number of people that we count.    In terms of Cuba diplomatic relations, which is also as you said historic and something that as the Department of Commerce we have been proud to play a role in. You know, we are working on the regulatory aspects of, and the licensing aspects particularly in the area of telecommunications where there is an opportunity for certain goods to be sold into Cuba. And so I am looking forward to having the opportunity to visit Cuba later this year.    There is an embargo in place. We respect the embargo. But it does, the current laws do allow for certain items to be sold into Cuba to the private sector particularly in the area of telecommunications. I think there will also be some agricultural opportunities now and banking opportunities.    Secretary Pritzker. You know Congressman, I have not studied the opportunities for two-way trade in the way we should. But I am sure that is something that our International Trade Administration will be looking into and I am happy to do more research for you.    Secretary Pritzker. I think it is $400 worth of cigars you can buy?    Secretary Pritzker. I think that is the limit right now.    Secretary Pritzker. Well Congressman, we are committed to accurately measuring how people self-identify their race and origin. And we tested an approach in 2020 and we are building on the research of that in twenty--we tested in 2010 and we are building on that for 2020. We have been actively working with stakeholders and in fact we have just put out a big Federal Register notice on this issue. So we are trying to make sure that we get this accurate, get this right. Because we are very much committed to an accurate Census.    Secretary Pritzker. Well I will start with the last part and then talk about our export initiative. But first in terms of foreign direct investment, we run a program called SelectUSA. In fact, I am quite excited, I got a report on, an update this morning about SelectUSA. This is the first ever effort by the federal government of the United States to welcome investment by foreign companies into the United States. And what we do know is about 5.6 million Americans today are employed by U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies.    So SelectUSA is both, is populated by people in 32 key markets that we want to attract investment from, and we also put on a summit. Our foreign commercial service officers that work on SelectUSA are helping those companies invest here in the United States and then we have staff here in the United States helping them navigate our federal system. But obviously we do not prefer one state over another.    Then we also run a summit once every 18 months. The second annual summit will be March 23rd and 24th. You are all invited. We will have about 1,200 attendees. The goal is 2,500 attendees and about 1,200 companies to join us for that. These are companies interested in investing in the United States. So we have a robust effort to reach out to foreign companies to invest in the United States.    In terms of helping American businesses export, that falls under our Foreign Commercial Service and our U.S. Export Assistance Center and our National Export Initiative which we just revitalized this year. We took a look at what we have been doing over the last three or four years and tried to update it to grow exports. And you know we hit record exports this year at $2.35 trillion. So we work both to attract foreign direct investment as well as helping American businesses, particularly small and medium sized businesses, that need help to understand well what market our U.S. Export Assistance Centers, of which there are 108 I think in the United States, they help American business identify what countries their products are competitive in. And then our Foreign Commercial Service Officers, which are in 75 countries around the world, help those companies then navigate the local regulations, the local rules, etcetera, to be able to do business there.    Secretary Pritzker. Ah. Well, to date what we are finding in terms of interest in investing in the United States, it is extremely high. We are the number one place in the world, by A.T. Kearney, by Goldman Sachs, to invest in the U.S. So in terms of regulatory burden it does not appear that that seems to be an impediment at this time for companies being interested in investing in the U.S.    But President Obama has asked his head of OIRA and each and ever one of us running our departments to look at our regulatory burden and to assess whether on a cost benefit basis, whether our regulations are working and are worth it and are effective. And we have been doing that here at the Department of Commerce. For the most part that would affect, for example, two different areas. First fisheries, how does it affect our fisheries and how we regulate our fisheries? And the second area is really our licensing at BIS. At BIS we, if you have a dual use product that we are trying to sell outside the United States there is what is going on is what is called export control reform. Something like 30,000 plus items have gone from being really restricted to being sold outside the United States to a much lower standard, which is what we manage. And so BIS has gone from 24,000 licenses in fiscal year 2013 to our estimate in fiscal year 2016 of about 50,000 licenses a year. So we are trying to lower the regulatory burden to encourage exports as well as foreign direct investment.    Secretary Pritzker. Well assuming that we get funding for two institutes then what we would do is we would run an open topic federal funding opportunity that would be posted. And then what we would do is consider the results of the FFO and we would structure the FFO that would take into account the recommendations that the PCAST has made, you know, the President's Advanced Manufacturing Partnership has also made. They have recommended various technologies. The idea being our goal is really to have industry decide what are the technologies that ought to be in the Department of Commerce institutes as opposed to at the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy they are choosing the technologies that they would like to see go from lab to market. We view that our role would be more to take our cues from industry.    Secretary Pritzker. That would help determine topics and then we would use those topics to determine, to run a competition where consortia would come together regionally. It seems that to date the consortia being put together, they are pretty broad actually in terms of their geography. They tend to end up locating one place but the groups that come together tend to often be broad based upon the researchers needed to bring the ideas from lab to market.    Secretary Pritzker. I hope so, too.    Secretary Pritzker. Well sequestration, you know, was very destructive to the Department of Commerce and particularly destructive to the Patent and Trademark Office. In terms of its effect on the Patent and Trademark Office, basically when sequestration came down the only real flexibility in terms of cutting that we had at that time was to cut our investment in IT. And so first of all it was sort of a double whammy. If you think about it PTO, as you said, is fully funded by fees. So the idea of sequestration does not make any sense because I do not know where that money went to but it is not accessible to PTO. But folks seeking a patent or a trademark put up fees in order to get their patent and trademark adjudicated, so that is kind of nuts. And the second thing is that our IT systems, it is really critical, we are working now on something called patent end to end. One of the issues that is often brought up about our Patent and Trademark Office is its backlog, or how long until we have a first adjudication and how long until a final adjudication. We have a target of ten months to first adjudication, and 20 months to final adjudication. By, if we were to have sequestration and then not have access to the money that third parties have paid as fees in to actually adjudicate a patent, the thing that would probably get cut is our systems. And the systems are the very things that help us actually expedite, systems and training and number of patent adjudicators, are kind of the three inputs to how fast you can do patent adjudication. So it would kind of be a double whammy to the Patent and Trademark Office. So I am certainly hoping that we can come to a budget as opposed to end up with sequestration.    How we protect against that, I think that falls under----    Secretary Pritzker. We do not have that control. That falls under----    Secretary Pritzker. I will fight, I will----    Secretary Pritzker. Congressman, you are probably more knowledgeable about this than I am because fortunately I have basically lived with a budget as far as I have understood it. And so if it is up to me to argue that with OMB, I will argue like all get it. I would love the support of you all. And if it is up to you I sure hope we can work this out. So I look forward to not finding ourselves in that situation because I do think it is nuts.    Secretary Pritzker. So this year we are seeking to increase the number of staff devoted to the hatchery plans review from two to six, and we are also reprioritizing some of the existing staff to assist with the reviews and analysis. So we are taking it very seriously to be able to try and address these challenges.    Secretary Pritzker. So what ITEC does is it really helps us identify areas for enforcement and then also does research for cases during enforcement. And what we need is we need more language proficient trade analysts. We need more subject matter experts, so that the budget calls for 15 new positions. And you know, fundamentally in a world where we have more trade agreements we need more enforcement because we have folks that are trying to avoid and evade our trade agreements.    Secretary Pritzker. Yes, thank you for asking. You know Congressman, when I arrived our IT situation was, pretty good at the bureaus but really pretty awful at the Office of the Secretary and in kind of the central office, if you will. We have been fortunate to be able to bring in a new CIO and he has really put together a plan overhauling not just our security risk management but also our procurement. So he is working with our Chief Financial Officer, who is sitting behind me, to understand what are our opportunities for bulk buying of equipment, of software, of different programs. And in fact I have already seen in certain software that we have needed to use for customer management, that process come into effect. I am not saying we are where we need to be, I am suggesting that we have a really strong initiative in place to really better manage this effort. But we have work to do.    Secretary Pritzker. I look forward to that.    Secretary Pritzker. Mr. Chairman, the goal of this is not to be a government run effort, this is meant to be a multi-stakeholder effort. And just let me step back for a minute. Our role, NTIA's role, has been one of stewardship. We are committed to a free and open Internet. And what we have done is set up. I met in fact this week with the head of ICANN. We laid down a set of criteria that are absolutely essential to be met before we would give up our stewardship role at this point. One is it has got to be a reliable multi-stakeholder model that is not government-led. It has got to be able to do its function of providing a secure, stable, and resilient Internet domain name process. It has got to be able to service its customers. It has got to be able to support an open and free Internet. So we are waiting now for their proposal back as to how they would do that and also how they would assure that governments are not going to highjack the Internet.    Secretary Pritzker. Multi-stakeholder is just what it sounds like. It is a broad group of constituents in the Internet world but it is not meant----    Secretary Pritzker. Yes, it is international.    Secretary Pritzker. Right.    Secretary Pritzker. So Mr. Chairman, that is what we are waiting for a proposal to understand is----    Secretary Pritzker. From ICANN. Our role is in the IANA transition. IANA is the domain name process. We supervise that process. ICANN actually runs that process today and we have a supervisory contract with them. And what we are suggesting is that we would ultimately let that contract expire, unless the criteria that we have set up are put in place. And we are waiting for ICANN, which is who does the role now, to give us a proposal that would satisfy us that the Internet cannot be hijacked by foreign countries or foreign companies, and that the Internet remains free and open.    Secretary Pritzker. There will be foreign players, yes. There will also be domestic players involved.    Secretary Pritzker. Happy to----    Secretary Pritzker. I would be delighted to have the opportunity----    Secretary Pritzker . To bring myself and my experts here and we go through it in detail.    Secretary Pritzker. Chairman, I share your concern. So this is not something that we are going to let happen, whereas I said there is not going to be a hostile takeover of the Internet.    Secretary Pritzker. Good. Thank you.
