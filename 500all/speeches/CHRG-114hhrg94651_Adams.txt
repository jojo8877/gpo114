    Ms. ADAMS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Velazquez, and thank you, gentlemen, for your testimony.    I agree that small businesses are the engines that drive our economy. Over the past several years, we have seen a severe credit crunch within our financial markets, banks have not given loans at the same rate as previous years.    With that in mind, Mr. Hodges, let me ask you about Funding Circle, which was founded based on your experiences as a business owner who had difficulty getting access to credit. With Funding Circle being one of the largest peer-to-peer lending sources, can you share potential market threats, both financially and technologically, that peer-to-peer lenders currently face or that you foresee may deter lending?    Ms. ADAMS. Thanks. Can you tell us a little bit about the demographics of the businesses your company services?    Ms. ADAMS. Peer-to-peer lending is a very good model for some communities, but many minority owned firms with the capacity to move to the next level need different types of access to affordable capital, and still many of these firms jump higher for less.    What models or policy recommendations can you offer to the Committee that we might explore that would be beneficial to minority owned firms on both traditional and non-traditional platforms?    Ms. ADAMS. Thank you. Would any of the other gentlemen like to respond to that question?    Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Renton?    Ms. ADAMS. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
