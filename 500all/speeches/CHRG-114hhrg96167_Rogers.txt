    Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Now, Mr. Roth, and this could be for Ms. Fitzmaurice, either one, because both of you have just made statements that inferred that you don't have access to databases that would give you the relevant information to make sure that these staffers don't get the SIDA badge, is that what I am hearing?    Ms. Fitzmaurice, let me go to you, you made reference a little while ago that you can't do your job without access to important information. So you are saying that you don't have that access?    Mr. Rogers. Is that an existing database that you want access to?    Mr. Rogers. Heretofore, you have been told you cannot have access? Or is it just something you all hadn't thought of?    Mr. Rogers. But you knew about it before now? I am trying to figure out why at this late time you are just now saying well, we probably should have had access to that database. If it was a database that had information about potential terrorists in it, why wouldn't you already be plugged into it?    Mr. Rogers. Who has control of that database now?    Mr. Rogers. Okay. Are they giving you any problems about accessing it? Is it just a technical issue now? Are they happy to let you in on it?    Mr. Rogers. How long do you think it will take you to work through that?    Mr. Rogers. That is very lawyerly.    Mr. Rogers. You sound like one.    Mr. Rogers. I am a recovering attorney too. That is why I know one when I see one. So 60 days? Ninety days?    Mr. Rogers. Mr. Roth, is what she just described what you were making reference to about the SIDA badges?    Mr. Rogers. A number of what?    Mr. Rogers. Why?    Mr. Rogers. Yes, I do. Let me ask, is this the first time that you have done an IG report on this problem?    Mr. Rogers. Okay. All right. Do you agree with Ms. Fitzmaurice's characterization that the 73 people that were identified as having terrorist ties really weren't a problem?    Mr. Rogers. Well, my time is up. I hope one of the other Members will pick up on this. Because I would like to know if they weren't a problem, why were they on the list to begin with? With that, I yield back. Thank you.
