    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Kamen, you testified that advanced grid technologies offer a promising future for U.S. electric systems, but the immediate challenge is to develop the appropriate business models and regulatory structures to effectively manage the integration of modern technologies. Do you have any recommendations as to what these business models and regulatory structures might look like?    Mr. Johnson. I would agree with that.    Mr. Johnson. OK.    Mr. Johnson. OK. Good.    Mr. Atkinson, your testimony suggests that the grid of the future will enable electrons to flow into or even multiple directions. Why is having flexibility in power flows significant, and how can advanced grid technologies facilitate this?    Mr. Johnson. OK. Mr. Christiansen, how can energy storage help utilities and consumers ride through outages and other power interruptions seamlessly? I understand it, but for the American people I would like----    Mr. Johnson . For them to hear from you.    Mr. Johnson. Sure.    Mr. Johnson. Yes. I--as a chief information officer for a global publicly traded manufacturing company, I had to be concerned about the data center and UPSs and those kinds of things, to make sure that we had that steady power.    A lot of folks don't realize in today's high-tech arena what a power outage, a power surge, and what those constantly changing power parameters do to solid state circuitry and those kinds of things. It wreaks havoc.    Mr. Ivy, you state in your testimony that greater adoption of advance grid technologies may help create self-healing grids. Can you expand on this concept of a self-healing grid a little bit?    Mr. Johnson. Um-hum.    Mr. Johnson. OK, very good.    Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. Thank you, gentlemen.
