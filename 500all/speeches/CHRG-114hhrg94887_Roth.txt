    Mr. Roth. Good afternoon, Chairman Katko, Ranking Member Rice, Mr. Thompson, and Members of the subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me here today to testify about TSA's PreCheck initiative. My public testimony today will focus only on the Unclassified portions of our recent inspection reports.    The majority of what we found is either Classified at the Secret level or contains Sensitive Security Information. I look forward to discussing the complete results and recommendation of our reports in greater detail once we move into the closed session.    In October 2011, TSA piloted PreCheck at four airports. After that program ended in 2012, Congress directed TSA to certify by the end of December 2013 that 25 percent of air passengers are eligible for expedited screening without lowering security standards. Congress also directed TSA to outline a strategy to increase the number of air passengers eligible for expedited screening to 50 percent by the end of December 2014.    To accomplish these goals, TSA did the following:    First, it granted some Government-vetted or known populations PreCheck eligibility.    Second, it deployed Managed Inclusion to allow the general public opportunities to receive PreCheck benefits.    Third, it implemented risk assessment rules to allow others to receive PreCheck eligibility.    Finally, it established the PreCheck application program for membership.    These actions have resulted in a massive increase in the population eligible to receive PreCheck. Our audits assessed the PreCheck initiative to determine, first, what processes and procedures TSA uses to vet program applicants properly; second, how TSA assesses member continued eligibility; and, third, how TSA tests is process for effectiveness and timeliness.    We conducted field work on this from January to June 2014. We determined that, as a concept, PreCheck is a positive step towards risk-based security screening. However, TSA needs to modify PreCheck vetting and security processes. We also determined that PreCheck communication and coordination need improvement. Our specific findings are either Classified or contain Sensitive information.    In addition, we responded to a whistle-blower disclosure concerning the use of the risk-based rule by the TSA Secure Flight program that may create a gap in aviation security. The inspection results of that are likewise SSI and have been delivered to the subcommittee.    Finally, to further illustrate the need for modification of PreCheck vetting and screening processes, we issued a letter report this month that found a notorious felon convicted of domestic terrorism crimes was granted PreCheck as a result of TSA's risk assessment rules. We reviewed the allegation after receiving information alleging the convicted felon was improperly cleared for PreCheck screening.    We are naturally concerned that, as evidenced by this incident, such rules are inadequate to ensure only low-risk populations receive PreCheck screening. As a result, we recommended TSA limit PreCheck screening to known passengers that TSA itself or other trusted Government partners had determined are members of trusted populations.    We are concerned about TSA's response to our findings. TSA has not accepted the majority of our recommendations.    Chairman Katko, this concludes my prepared statement. I welcome any questions that you or other Members of the subcommittee may have.    Mr. Roth. When we engaged in this inquiry after receiving the whistle-blower complaint, the TSO did not feel empowered to make that decision on his or her own self and checked with the supervisor.    My understanding is our recommendations to TSA were to clarify exactly what authority the TSO has so, in fact, they do have that empowerment when they see a situation that they believe is unsafe.    Mr. Roth. According to our investigation, the supervisor ordered that person to go through the PreCheck lane.    Mr. Roth. That person had several disqualifying criminal offenses which would have prohibited that person from being a member of PreCheck.    Mr. Roth. The TSA has a rule that the TSOs may increase the level of screening a passenger receives at a checkpoint based on a particular belief that can be put into words and explained to others that is based on observations that suggest an individual or----    Mr. Roth. I don't have that answer for you, Congressman.
