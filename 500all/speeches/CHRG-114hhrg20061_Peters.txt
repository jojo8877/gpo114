    Mr. Peters. I want to thank you, General. I apologize. They scheduled two hearings at the same time for me so I am trying to run between both.    And what I would like to do, Mr. Chairman, if it is all right, I have a couple questions having to do with strategic ports and the use of them that I will submit for the record. And I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, your having this hearing.
