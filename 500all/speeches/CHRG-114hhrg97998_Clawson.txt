    Mr. Clawson. Thank you to the chairwoman for having this hearing. You are always consistent, and we appreciate that, as Representative Meadows said.    I appreciate you all coming. I am very interested to see what you think about how Egypt is going to handle ISIS and at the same time treat their citizens, particularly Christians, fairly. What are they going to do with Russia? And how are they going to treat Israel? And how do you get all that right at the same time? I think they have got a big balancing act here, and I am very curious what you have all got to say about it because we need to stop ISIS. We need to protect all folks, particularly Christians in this case, and we have got to protect Israel. So I am looking forward to hearing what you all have to say.    Mr. Clawson. Where does the trend go with respect to Israel?    Mr. Clawson. And so if this intersection of incentives for security of the Sinai, if that ever goes away, as we lose, as our country loses influence, I think all three of you said that in your opening statements, does that put our, will that put our ally at more risk?    Mr. Clawson. Our money is the glue.    I yield back.
