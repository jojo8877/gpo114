    Mr. McNerney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for holding the hearing.    Mr. Stanislaus, how many tons of coal ash are produced in a year in this country?    Mr. McNerney. Any idea what fraction of that is used in beneficial ways, you know, for construction or road grade material or so on?    Mr. McNerney. Is there more opportunity for beneficial use of coal ash?    Mr. McNerney. How would that happen? What would it take for more beneficial uses to come about?    Mr. McNerney. So that is a part of the rule that has been promulgated.    Mr. McNerney. OK.    I am a little concerned about citizen lawsuits with regard to the rule or the potential legislation that might come out of this issue. How quickly do you think that we will start to see improvements in the safety of coal-ash disposal sites as a result of the rule that has been promulgated?    Mr. McNerney. Do you expect the robust transparency provisions to incentivize compliance?    Mr. McNerney. Do you think that the citizens and the States are going to buy the disclosures that the disposal agencies are going to be putting out on their Web sites? Do you think people are going to buy it, or do you think that they are going to revert to lawsuits to satisfy their concerns?    Mr. McNerney. So there is enough teeth, then, in your opinion, in the compliance requirements that people will take satisfaction that they are actually doing what they are saying?    Mr. McNerney. The last question: Is there a concern that if the committee passed a bill that was signed into law, it would stifle the beneficial use of coal ash or the safe disposal of coal ash? Do you think that passing a law would stifle what is going to take place as a result of the rule?    Mr. McNerney. OK.    I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
