    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Let me begin, Mr. Judd, with you. Is it your understanding--okay. I know that you said you don't work at the ports of entry. But is it your understanding that the BCC cards can be used by individuals illegally to get into the country?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Is there any evidence, Mr. Starr, that that has ever happened?    Mr. Hice. All right. So you would say that no one has ever entered this country with a stolen card?    Mr. Hice. Yes, it would.    Mr. Hice. It would be very difficult. Because from what I understand that has happened and there are times inspectors don't check the cards properly so there certainly are occasions where, as the chairman brought up earlier, they're used as flash cards.    How often does an individual just flash the card and they're waived on into the country?    Mr. Hice. Did they know you were there?    Mr. Hice. Okay. That probably has something to do with it.    Is it true that the CBP was only able to read the cards, the RFID cards about two-thirds of the time?    Mr. Hice. It's my understanding that the cards don't always work properly. And so my question, ultimately, is coming to if the cards don't always work properly then the stolen cards could still be used.    Mr. Harris, you're nodding your head.    Mr. Hice. Okay. It appeared to be you were.    Mr. Hice. Okay. So none of you have any awareness of the RFID cards not working?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Mr. Starr, do you have any idea how many--or any of you, for that matter--how many U.S. citizens have disappeared, have been kidnapped, abducted?    Mr. Hice. Who would have those figures?    Mr. Hice. Correct.    Mr. Hice. All right. What about other crimes from disappearances to abductions?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Is there any evidence of Americans being targeted?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know my time is up.    I would just like to add that I have put forth--Mr. Judd mentioned a while ago about the horrible crime committed in Montana after a person was in your hands, and I put forth a bill, TRAC, which stands for Tracking Re-offending Alien Criminals, specifically the sex offenders. I would urge my colleagues to check that out, H.R. 2793, and cosponsor.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
