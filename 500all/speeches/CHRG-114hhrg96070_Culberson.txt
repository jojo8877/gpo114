    Mr. Culberson. The Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee will come to order. And we are delighted to have with us today the Commerce Secretary.    Secretary Pritzker, we are delighted to have you. Thank you for your service to the country. And as you present the President's 2016 Department of Commerce budget request, we are just delighted you could be with us today and really genuinely appreciate your service to the country.    You have many important responsibilities of the department including obviously promoting trade and dual use technologies, making sure those are not exported improperly, helping economically distressed communities, administering our patent and trademark laws, preparing for and conducting the decennial census, advancing the measurement of science standards and technology, and forecasting the weather and protecting and researching our oceans which is extraordinarily important.    And we will, of course, work with you to do everything that we can to be sure that each one of your important responsibilities are adequately funded, but it is important to point out that the department's request proposes discretionary appropriations totaling $9.8 billion which is a total of $1.3 billion higher than last year.    And your request proposes increases for nearly every Department of Commerce program. And in light of the sequester and the difficult circumstances budget-wise that we find ourselves in, it is not a realistic budget proposal. It also assumes a number of different fee and tax increases which are simply not going to happen.    The subcommittee will not have an allocation that is sufficient to fund this excessive level of spending. While we recognize the important work that you do and we will work with you and the Members of the Committee to meet the resource needs of your highest priority programs, we have to find savings and reduce spending for lower priority or ineffective programs. Our current budget environment will simply not allow everyone to get everything that they want.    We look forward to hearing from you about how we can help you improve the management of the department and to ensure that Commerce employees, for example, are not abusing tele-work programs.    We heard earlier from the inspector general. Our first hearing of the year was from the inspector general and the weather satellite programs. We want to make sure they meet their cost and schedule milestones.    And the 2020 census, we want to work with you to make sure that the cost of the 2020 census is less than the last census and to find out how you are prioritizing cyber security and protecting the department from the ever-growing threat of cyber attack.    We will do, as I say, all we can to help you, but we are going to have to prioritize and cut wherever we can. I do appreciate your service to the country.    And I want to, before we proceed, recognize my colleague, Mr. Fattah, for any remarks he might wish to make.    Mr. Culberson. Madam Secretary, we will, of course, without objection enter your statement into the record in its entirety and welcome your testimony to summarize your statement. And if you could, keep your statement to five minutes. Thank you very much, and we are pleased to recognize you.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Madam Secretary.    I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about the census. I have a lot of constituents who are concerned about the American Community Survey, the intrusiveness of it in a lot of areas, and, of course, the survey response is currently mandatory.    Is that statutory or by your internal administrative rules that the survey is mandatory? I think it is administrative rule, but it is mandatory.    Mr. Culberson. I think it is----    Mr. Culberson. It is mandatory by statute. So we would need to change the law in order to make it voluntary?    And I notice also there is a lot of overlap between the information that the community survey asks and information, for example, that the Internal Revenue Service already has.    And the estimate, I know that the Commerce Department is predicting that the survey is planning for the census in 2020 to cost less than the last census, but the estimates show that the cost of the census is going to be nearly $13 billion. We just simply do not have $13 billion to spend on a census.    So one way it seems to me that is the straightforward way to save money is to use other branches of the government to provide some of that data, and so many of the questions that are asked in that long census could be obtained from the Internal Revenue Service.    Have you worked with the Authorizing Committee on this? What are you planning on doing in order to ensure that you are using information already collected by other branches of the government to bring down the cost of the census?    Mr. Culberson. So you will be using, for example, information from the IRS to help you fill in some of the blanks?    Mr. Culberson. But you anticipate using IRS records?    Mr. Culberson. Can you use IRS records?    Mr. Culberson. Right.    Mr. Culberson. I ask for a couple of reasons. A, obviously you want to try to save money by using administrative records that are collected by other agencies, but, B, I am a big believer in privacy and our most important right as Americans is to be left alone which is why I am concerned about the American Community Survey.    It is very long and intrusive and it is treated as though it is mandatory. I understand that it is statutory. That is something we in Congress ought to change because fundamentally the census ought to just be who are you, how many people live there, what is your, you know, ancestry,--very simple, straightforward questions.    I am also concerned about whether or not privacy advocates are aware that you may be using IRS records with the problems that the IRS has had recently about targeting people. I am concerned about the privacy angle and I do want to know whether or not you will be using IRS records.    Mr. Culberson. I understand another way you will be trying to save money is with allowing people to log on and handle a lot of this online. And if there are 140 million households estimated to participate in the survey, you are going to have a lot of people visiting the Web site. The Obama Care Web site had about 250,000 visitors before it just completely melted down.    What are you doing to prevent something similar from happening to the Census Web site?    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    You know, we just simply will not have the money this year. It is going to be a very difficult budget environment.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much.    Mr. Fattah.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much.    Ms. Herrera Beutler.    Mr. Culberson. I yield to my colleague and good friend Mr. Serrano from New York.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much. Judge Carter.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Judge. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. We are in the middle of a vote. We have got 13 minutes, and I would like to recognize Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much. I really just want to zero in on one area where I think we will wrap up after this.    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    Mr. Culberson. Go ahead, sure.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Chaka. I want to ask about the Internet. The National Telecommunication and Information Administration has contracted with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers since as I recall almost the beginning of the Internet when the Defense Department first ran it, but it has always been controlled by the United States. This is an American owned company. And the administration recently came out with a proposal to shift that over to a global multi-stakeholder model. What would be the role of foreign governments and international organizations like the United Nations in the new planned model?    Mr. Culberson. But a multi, when you say multi-stakeholder, that includes either foreign companies or foreign governments' involvement either directly or indirectly?    Mr. Culberson. International?    Mr. Culberson. International, that is what I was concerned about.    Mr. Culberson. Because the Chinese, of course, are aggressively censoring the Internet. I am strongly opposed to this FCC regulation that just came out, I am deeply concerned that this regulation that the FCC has just come out with is going to put the government in a position to regulate the Internet like a utility and the Internet has thrived because it is free and unregulated. What role would countries like China have, or companies owned and operated within China have in the administration of the Internet under this proposal?    Mr. Culberson. From?    Mr. Culberson. I just want to make sure I understood. The proposal you have asked them to come forward with--you have asked them to come up with a proposal that involves foreign-owned companies?    Mr. Culberson. Okay. Thank you. That is what I wanted to establish. I will have additional questions I know for the record. If, of course, Mr. Fattah, you have additional questions?    Mr. Culberson. Good idea.    Mr. Culberson. There is a lot of concern.    Mr. Culberson. Sure, we will set it up.    Mr. Culberson. Because there is a lot of concern. Our constituents, Judge, I know yours are as well concerned about this.    Mr. Culberson. Well I assure you, Congress will help make sure that does not happen too.                                         Wednesday, March 18, 2015.    Mr. Culberson. The House Appropriations Committee for Commerce, Justice, and Science will come to order.    And I want to welcome everyone to this morning's hearing with Dr. Kathy Sullivan, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and NOAA Administrator.    We deeply appreciate your service to the country, Dr. Sullivan. We look forward to hearing from you and asking questions about your budget for the coming year.    And we have a particularly difficult budget year recognizing the immense importance of the work that NOAA does from weather forecasting to ocean research. We want to make sure we get our weather satellite system, and make sure there are no gaps in coverage there, of course.    But it is an extremely difficult budget year and we are, as good stewards of our taxpayers' hard-earned tax dollars, going to have to be sure we are limiting our investments to our top priorities, while recognizing that you have asked for about a ten percent increase above the current fiscal year.    In your budget request for 2016, you are asking for $5.9 billion, an increase of about $540 million dollars. We will certainly do our best to be sure that top priorities of NOAA are funded, but, I want to make sure it is clear for the record with every one of our other witnesses, that we are facing a very difficult budget environment and many of the assumptions that the President makes in his budget are not going to happen such as tax increases and fee increases, et cetera. These are just simply not realistic.    But we will, of course, do everything we can to protect the important work that NOAA is doing. Weather forecasting is so vital, and the work that you are doing in ocean mapping and exploration is absolutely essential. And we will do our very best to protect you.    The work that we do has always been bipartisan in nature. This subcommittee's devotion and support for the sciences and scientific research, space exploration, weather forecasting, and law enforcement is a long tradition of the subcommittee.    It has been a privilege for me to be a part of it since I first got on the Appropriations Committee and particularly to succeed my mentor and dear good friend, Frank Wolf, who we all have great memories of and I do my best every day that I have got this job to live up to the high standard Frank Wolf set.    It is a privilege to have you with us here today. And I would like to recognize my good friend, Mr. Fattah, for any opening statement he would like to make.    Thank you.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    Mr. Culberson. That is impressive.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much.    Dr. Sullivan, it is a pleasure to have you here with us and we will without objection submit your full statement for the record in its entirety, and welcome your summarization of your testimony. And we are pleased to have you here today and would recognize you for your presentation to the subcommittee. Thank you, ma'am.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Dr. Sullivan. We appreciate your testimony and your leadership of the agency.    And as a father of a daughter who is keenly interested in the sciences, I would, if I could, just like to open by asking you to tell the committee and anyone out there listening, particularly young girls who are thinking about going into the sciences, what led you to major in geology and go on to join NASA. Tell us what led you into the sciences, what inspired you, and talk to us a little about any barriers that you encountered as a woman, if any, and what you did to overcome those.    Mr. Culberson. What was your focus and what language?    Mr. Culberson. Dr. Robert Ballard's specialty is geology.    Mr. Culberson. Right.    Mr. Culberson. It does indeed make you stronger and it is a great story. And I saw that you were on the mission that deployed the Hubble Space Telescope which continues to--    Mr. Culberson. Yeah. Continues to give tremendous benefits to all of humanity.    And the Space Program in particular, I know it is a vital part of the work that you do at NOAA and we are, all of us on the committee, concerned. We want to make sure there is as little a gap as possible in our coverage of satellites.    There was some early problems with the management of the Polar weather satellite. We have, all of us on the committee, we reviewed the inspector general's report who points out the potential gap in data between the current on-orbit Polar weather satellite, the NPP, should it fail or if there is a launch failure for the next Polar satellite.    Congress included $111 million in Hurricane Sandy supplemental to address this gap and the overall lack of program robustness. So we essentially fully funded NOAA's weather satellite procurement request for the last several years.    What distinct actions has NOAA taken to address the potential gap and what is your best estimate on the length of the gap that might occur and what could we do, if anything, to move up the launch of the JPSS-1?    Mr. Culberson. Right.    Mr. Culberson. What is your best estimate today of the potential gap and when is your best estimate on when you can launch and what, if anything, can we do to help speed that up?    Mr. Culberson. Your best personal estimate.    Mr. Culberson. Sure.    Mr. Culberson. It sounds like from your answer there is not much we could do to speed that up. The supply chain, your vendors tell you there is only so much they can do. Not much then this subcommittee could to do to help you speed up or make that launch date any earlier than early 2017?    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    Mr. Fattah.    Mr. Culberson. Up three times.    Mr. Culberson. And the resolution has probably gotten better, too, because you are able to use----    Mr. Culberson. How do you pronounce it?    Mr. Culberson. Interesting. Okay.    Mr. Culberson. Well, as a linguist, you know, I figured----    Mr. Culberson. You got it right.    Mr. Culberson. On the west coast?    Mr. Culberson. Eighty percent?    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much.    Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. We are interested in Snapper in Texas as well.    Mr. Culberson. And could you talk about the rule itself that they are going to publish tomorrow?    Mr. Culberson. And based on what data which is a really important question also when it comes to----    Mr. Culberson . Weather data for global warming.    Mr. Culberson. And in Texas. I am keenly interested in this question. So do not be constrained, Mr. Jolly, by that----    Mr. Culberson. Yes.    Mr. Culberson. And you are going to hear about salmon from the West Coast.    Mr. Culberson. Is the whole process transparent and is the data out there for independent verification?    Mr. Culberson. This is important.    Mr. Culberson. So you like Mr. Jolly's proposal?    Mr. Culberson. But you like his idea?    Mr. Culberson. And I would like to offer, maybe we can sit down together and have a follow-up meeting on this, because it is a keen interest to me as well and in Texas. And Washington State and the west coast have got similar concerns that are maybe not identical, but they have also got some real serious concerns about fisheries, because it is so important to their economy as well. So I will indulge you guys next.    Mr. Culberson. Right, that is right.    Mr. Culberson. In fact, water quality has improved so much around the Gulf Coast. We are seeing porpoises and improvements in stocks in areas, like you said, we have not seen them before.    Data collection is so vital, to make sure the data is accurate. I cannot find in your submitted statement, I heard you say that this is the warmest year on record. Where is that and what are you referring to?    Mr. Culberson. Is that in your summary--I cannot figure out where it is--is that something that you added?    Mr. Culberson. Okay. The data has to be accurate. I mean, that is the most important thing. As long as we have got good data, that is something we can all work with. And I think that is one of the biggest concerns, whether it be with the climate or with fisheries or with anything else that we do. Whether it comes to the National Science Foundation, NASA, or NOAA, we just need good data to make good decisions. We have got to be certain the data is accurate.    So I concur completely. And we ran a little over, but that is okay. And when it comes to salmon and the west coast, you guys can do the same thing. So Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Culberson. Right. Thank you.    Mr. Culberson. I recognize the young lady from Washington State.    Mr. Culberson. Overate.    Mr. Culberson. So in people's memory, they have never seen this many sea lions before.    Mr. Culberson. Why are they washing up on beaches in California starving to death?    Mr. Culberson. Mrs. Roby.    Mr. Culberson. You only went over a little bit, thank you, that is fine. I want to ask a little bit about the Polar Satellite Follow-On because you have requested $380 million in new funding for this. And the out year budgets for this program are substantial, growing to nearly $600 million in two years. If you could describe for us what the funding would buy in terms of risk reduction, robustness for the Joint Polar Satellite System, and then the, earlier you mentioned efficiencies, I believe, in acquiring systems simultaneously. Talk to us a little bit more about that, if you could?    Mr. Culberson. So NOAA is actually designing and building the spacecraft, overseeing the design and construction of the spacecraft?    Mr. Culberson. Okay. So NASA is actually the lead on this?    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    Mr. Culberson. Sure.    Mr. Culberson. Right.    Mr. Culberson. I want to dive into this more with you in separate meetings----    Mr. Culberson . Because I understand you are working hand in glove with NASA but I want to understand more about how that process works. Because it seems to me logically you ought to just let NASA build the spacecraft for you and NOAA obviously be the customer and provide funding. But NASA----    Mr. Culberson . Does a pretty good, NASA does a pretty good job.    Mr. Culberson. What is the Earth Observing Nanosatellite-Microwave instrument, and is that critical to weather forecasting? It, is obviously brand new, does that introduce any unnecessary risk? And what process did you go through to determine it was an appropriate investment?    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. Mr. Fattah.    Mr. Culberson. Very quick question, Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. Why not contract out more of this work? I am not a big traveler. One of the few trips I have ever taken has been out to go see Dr. Ballard, on the Nautilus. They do extraordinary work.    Mr. Culberson. And the private sector is, I think the universities around the country would leap at the chance if NOAA was a customer and was offering to, I know Texas A&M, for example, has a wonderful oceanographic research vessel. Why not contract out more of this work, rather than invest in purchasing new ships which can be tremendously expensive and costly to maintain? When, I am just a big believer in the yellow pages test.    Mr. Culberson. If you can find a service in the yellow pages that the government does, we should contract it out as much as we possibly can to provide better service at a better price for the taxpayers.    Mr. Culberson. With great success, very----    Mr. Culberson. Well, the existing fleet. I just wondered whether you have, because I had the same question of NSF. Years ago I remember the Bush administration tried to transfer the responsibility for building and maintaining the ships that go to the Antarctic to the National Science Foundation from the Coast Guard. NSF has got enough on their plate. So I fought hard to get that out of NSF. So I had the same question of the     Mr. Culberson. If the money was out there and you were proposing to do this, have you ever looked at, looking forward, encouraging the private sector if there is a pot of money out there, we are willing to be a customer, there is X amount of money available. Have you seen any interest from the private sector or universities to----    Mr. Culberson. Right.    Mr. Culberson. And the buoy, the maintenance of the tsunami detection system, you said you are up to about 80 percent, and that is with NOAA vessels?    Mr. Culberson. I will follow up with you on that. But I will also be following up on you, I am very concerned about the report that came out in November that hackers from Communist China had breached the computer systems at NOAA and essentially the report was in AP that four of your Web sites were compromised by an internet source, attacked. And my predecessor, Chairman Wolf, discovered that the attack originated in China and came only a couple of days after the Communist Chinese had also hacked into the U.S. Postal Service computers and, U.S. Postal Service's computers and compromised information from some of its customers and employees. How long was NOAA's system down? I understood they actually took over control of some of NOAA's weather satellites. And could you talk to us a little bit more about what happened?    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    Mr. Culberson. We will sit down and visit about it. I know Mr. Fattah is concerned about this, we all are concerned about it as well.    Mr. Culberson. And I also want to visit with you about the report that, let us see, when is this? This is Inspector General Report 1425A that talks about the risks posed by the inconsistent implementation of mobile device protections increases the likelihood of malware infection. I want to go through some of that with you as well.    Mr. Culberson. Because cyber is so important, and it is of keen interest not just to NOAA but obviously throughout the federal government. And it continues to look like the Chinese have been particularly bad actors in this area and we want to make sure that we are doing all we can to help protect you.    Mr. Culberson. I deeply appreciate your service to the country. I will also be following up with you on making sure that the data is accurate in terms of making sure--where, I still cannot find in your testimony where you said this is the warmest year on record. Warmest year on record where?    Mr. Culberson. I mean----    Mr. Culberson. It was the warmest year on record throughout the entire planet, or in the United States, or where?    Mr. Culberson. Average across the globe.    Mr. Culberson. Okay. I am keenly interested in following up with that because as Mr. Jolly pointed out we just want to make sure we get accurate data. And I was alarmed to see that there was, there has been in a lot of documentation that estimates, that weather data has been estimated or extrapolated and averaged up. I just want to make sure we have got accurate data to make good decisions. I do appreciate your service to the country and we look forward to following up with you on these and other matters, and we will submit any additional questions for the record. Thank you very much.                                          Wednesday, March 4, 2015.                       Chairman's Opening Remarks    Mr. Culberson. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science will come to order.    Before we begin, I wonder if I could take a moment, General Bolden, to recognize and thank Mike Ringler who has been our chief clerk on the committee for many, many years and a Rock of Gibraltar for all of us.    It has been a real privilege, Mike, for us to work with you, for me to work with you. You have taught us all so much and we are going to miss you. And you have served the country and this committee so well. We are really genuinely going to miss you and I wish you all the best.    Thank you for everything you have done for the country and the Congress and this committee. I really mean it. Thank you. Thank you. We are going to miss you.    Mr. Culberson. Yes.    Mr. Culberson. Back to Pennsylvania as soon as he could.    Mr. Culberson. Today is also significant because it is Bob Bonner's 20th, I believe, anniversary of helping with the minority staff.    Mr. Culberson. And it is a real tribute to both of you guys.    Mr. Culberson. Well, we have always had a bipartisan bill and tremendous cooperation and support on the committee. It is a tribute to both of you guys and the great work that you have done, but also it is a real privilege for us all to work together on such noble, good causes as NASA and law enforcement and scientific research and keeping the United States at the cutting edge. It is something all of us on this subcommittee share a passion for and you guys have been essential to its success and we really appreciate it.    In fact, when I was asked to serve on the Appropriations Committee back in December of 2002 going into my second term, I was at a dinner with Tom DeLay who was my neighbor to the south. He was becoming majority leader. He said I will give up my seat on appropriations if you will take it.    And I was reluctant. I do not like to spend money if I can avoid it. I said unless it is science or NASA or National Defense, the answer is probably no. And he said you are hired. It has been a great assignment. I asked to serve on this subcommittee so that I could be here to help the National Science Foundation and NASA.    So it is a genuine privilege and something I want to, you know, thank the people in my district in Texas and the Members of this committee. It is just a privilege to be here to serve as chairman, to follow in Frank Wolf's footsteps who has done so much for so many years to help NASA and the scientific community.    Frank was a real mentor to me and it is an extraordinary privilege for me to serve as chairman and to have you here today, General Bolden. You are a true American hero, great inspiration I know to a lot of young people all over the country. You are a role model for young people I know all over the country.    We all admire you immensely. Just deeply appreciate your service to the country and the marine corps, as an astronaut and the administrator for NASA. We admire you immensely, sir, and it is just a real privilege for me to be here today, for all of us to be here to help you achieve your mission of making sure the United States maintains its leadership in the world as the best space program, manned and unmanned on the planet.    The President's budget is asking for $18.5 billion for NASA which is an increase of $519 million above the current fiscal year. And we have a very difficult budget environment, as you know, sir, but there is strong support of this subcommittee for your mission.    We want to make sure that you have the resources you need and the freedom that you need and support to do what is on your plate. You have got a lot on your plate and never seem to have enough resources. It is an ongoing problem.    In this particularly difficult budget environment, we have also got to make sure we are fully funding the FBI, the other Federal law enforcement programs. We have got, of course, the Department of Commerce, the National Science Foundation, NIST, and adequately funding all of these programs and others within this budget environment is going to be very, very challenging.    We do not yet know how the House budget is going to shape up, but we can feel pretty confident that the President's budget recommendation is one that we are simply not going to be able to achieve because it assumes a lot of tax increases which certainly are not going to happen.    But I know from my work on this subcommittee that you are going to find all of us arm in arm in making sure that NASA gets the support that you need, sir, to do your job.    We will be using the timer today to make sure, if we could, that everyone is recognized in a timely fashion. And I would be privileged at this time to recognize my good friend, Chaka Fattah, for any comments he would like to make.                     Ranking Member Opening Remarks    Mr. Culberson. General Bolden, we welcome your testimony. Your entire statement, of course, will be entered into the record without objection and we welcome your testimony, sir. And, again, thank you for your service to the country.                    Administrator's Opening Remarks    General Bolden. Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I want to just take a quick moment to echo everyone's sentiments to Mike Ringler. I am glad you broke the ice because I did not want to say anything and spill the beans if nobody knew it. But it has been a great pleasure working with Mike and we are going to miss him.    So, Mike, best of luck from all of us at NASA.    I want to congratulate you, Mr. Chairman, also on becoming the chairman of this committee because I do know through the years of our conversations how much it means to you and how serious you are about the duties of this committee. So I think we are very fortunate to have you in that position. I also thank you, as I mentioned earlier, for your recent visits to several of our facilities out on the West Coast and look forward to hosting you out there some more.    Mr. Chairman, to you and the Members of the subcommittee, the President is proposing, as you mentioned, a fiscal year 2016 budget of $18.5 billion for NASA that builds on the 2015 appropriation and the significant investments the Administration and the Congress have made in America's space program over the past six years.    Thanks to the hard work of our NASA team and partners all across America, we have made a lot of progress on our journey to Mars. In fact, we have gotten farther on this path to sending humans to Mars than at any point in NASA's history. And this budget will keep us moving forward.    The support of this subcommittee and the Congress are essential to this journey. The International Space Station (ISS) is the critical first step in this work. It is our springboard to the rest of the solar system and we are committed to extending space station operations to at least 2024. Thanks to the grit, determination, and American ingenuity, we have returned ISS cargo resupply missions to the United States, insourcing these jobs and creating a new private market in low earth orbit.    Under a plan outlined by the Administration early in its term, we have also awarded two American companies, SpaceX and Boeing, fixed price contracts to safely and cost effectively transport our astronauts to the International Space Station from U.S. soil. This will end our sole reliance on Russia. It is critical that we receive the funding requested for 2016 so that we can meet our 2017 target date and stop writing checks to the Russian Space Agency.    Our newest, most powerful rocket ever developed, the Space Launch System (SLS) has moved from formulation to development, something no other exploration class vehicle has achieved since the agency built the space shuttle.    The Orion spacecraft performed flawlessly on its first flight to space this past December. The SLS and Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) are on track for launch capability readiness by November of 2018 and the teams are hard at work on completing the technical and design reviews for Orion.    Our budget also funds a robust science program with dozens of operating missions studying our solar system and universe. New Horizons is preparing for its arrival at Pluto in July and Dawn is now approaching the dwarf planet Ceres.    Before we send humans to Mars, robots are paving the way. We are at work on a Mars rover for 2020 and have begun planning a mission to explore Jupiter's fascinating moon, Europa.    NASA is a leader in Earth science and our constantly expanding view of our planet from space is helping us better understand and prepare for these changes. NASA has 21 research missions studying Earth. In the last year alone, we launched an unprecedented five more. We also are at work on humanity's first voyage to our home star, a mission that will repeatedly pass through the sun's outer atmosphere.    NASA's Hubble, Chandra and Kepler space telescopes explore the universe beyond our solar system. Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), is taking shape right now out in Maryland and a new mission is in development to extend Kepler's pioneering work in finding planets.    Technology drives science, exploration, and our journey to Mars. With the President's request, NASA will continue to maintain a steady pipeline of technology to ensure that we continue to lead the world in space exploration and scientific discovery.    NASA is also with you when you fly and we are committed to transforming aviation particularly as we just celebrated the 100th anniversary of the NACA last night at the National Air and Space Museum. But we intend to dramatically reduce the environmental impact, maintain safety in more crowded skies, and pave the way toward a revolutionary aircraft shapes and propulsion systems.    Mr. Chairman, America's space program is not just alive. It is thriving. The strong support we receive from this subcommittee is making that happen. I particularly appreciate the generous fiscal year 2015 appropriation.    As the President said in his state of the union address, and I quote, ``We are pushing out into the solar system not just to visit but to stay, part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars,'' unquote.    NASA looks forward to working with the Congress to make this vision a reality. I would be pleased to respond to your questions.    Mr. Culberson. General Bolden, thank you.    Before I go into some specific areas, we started our hearing schedule this year with the inspectors general because they always do a good job of identifying inefficiencies and ways to save money and particularly in light of the tough budget environment we are going to be facing this year and how everyone on this subcommittee, as I said earlier, are strong supporters of NASA.    I miss having our friend, Adam Schiff, here. He is now the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. And I know he is here in spirit and will certainly be working with us to help support the recommendations of this subcommittee for NASA.    But if you could, talk to us a minute about any specific example where NASA has implemented Inspector General or GAO recommendations to save money or create efficiencies.    General Bolden. Sir, I would be very glad to do so. Since the Inspector General's report and also thanks to this committee, I think everyone knows that we contracted for a study by NAPA which was done last year. They gave us 27 recommendations with reference to Foreign National Access Management (FNAM). We took all of those recommendations to heart and are well on the way to complying with them.    We have made structural changes in our governance at the Agency and we see through our construction of facilities program that our buildings are becoming leaner, and I mean that in terms of the acronym for energy efficient. We now have LEED buildings across the Nation that is showing that we are trying to save money through our facilities as we reduce our footprint and in the place of excessive infrastructure replace it with very efficient buildings.    If you talk more about governance, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and many of the other critical people in positions at NASA headquarters now report directly to me, so they are my direct reports. So in that manner, we are streamlining the way that we conduct project management.    I would point out that over the past six years since I have been the NASA administrator, we are very proud to say that most programs have come in on cost and on schedule which in the past was somewhat rare. So I think that the results that we have seen in the last six years say that we have taken everything to heart from the IG and from this committee.    Mr. Culberson. Other than reducing the property footprint and streamlining project management, what other steps have you taken to implement, for example, cost saving measures that were recommended either by GAO or the Inspector General?    General Bolden. We have done a number of efforts and I would take it for the record to bring you a compilation----    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    General Bolden . Of the things that we have done. But I just tried to give you a few of those----    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    General Bolden . Top line efforts.    Mr. Culberson. Terrific. And also I want to be sure to follow up with you on limiting the access of foreign nationals, particularly the Chinese, to NASA flight centers. There is, I think, an ongoing problem with the ability of Chinese nationals that are working at universities on a research project gaining access to flight centers and we want to make sure that that does not continue to happen.    Program management, project management is something Inspector General Paul Martin also talked to us about and has pointed out that there is a--excuse me. He talked specifically about better program management and four major challenges that he identified in his report.    He identified that there was an underestimation of technical complexity and how that impacted cost and risk. Funding stability is, of course, a continuing problem, limited opportunity for program managers, development, and moving people around.    Talk to us a little more, if you could, about the way that NASA has responded to his recommendations on project management.    General Bolden. I think what Paul was talking about was past practices where when we estimated cost and we estimated schedule, we were optimistic. When I talked about the fact that over the last six years we have brought in programs and projects on time and on schedule, it speaks to that directly.    We spend more time training our program and project managers with formal training. We now have a formal position that is called the Chief Knowledge Officer at NASA headquarters who takes lessons learned from past programs and projects and that is taught to incoming program and project managers so that they understand the mistakes and the errors of program and project management in the past.    We now have a process that all of our programs go through which formalizes our estimation of cost and schedule. We have set a threshold of 70 percent certainty for cost and schedule as a threshold for us. Since we have done that, I think if you look at our science programs, that is what enabled us to bring things like MAVEN or some of the others in if not under cost, actually on cost. I think that is what Paul was addressing.    Mr. Culberson. He also suggested giving your information technology administrator full responsibility, and I hope that you are following through on that recommendation.    General Bolden. Yes, sir. The comment that I made earlier about making the CIO for the Agency a direct report to me, I think that is what Paul was talking about. So the CIO--is that what you are talking about?    Mr. Culberson. On cyber because there is a lot of concern about the vulnerability of NASA applications.    General Bolden. I understand.    Mr. Culberson. You obviously have a very big public footprint, as you should, but all of those applications, all those apps that are out there for people's phones and all the public Web sites open you up to hacking. And he was concerned that your information and technology director does not have the authority that he needs as in other agencies. That is what I am talking about.    General Bolden. And that was the reference that I made to, and you used the term information technology----    Mr. Culberson. I may not be using the right----    General Bolden . That is my Chief Information Officer.    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    General Bolden. So the Chief Information Officer is a direct report to me, to the administrator, which means----    Mr. Culberson. In terms of the scope of his authority, I hope you are taking his recommendation to heart to give that individual more authority.    General Bolden. Yes. The fact that he reports to me means that he makes policy for the Agency since I make policy for the Agency. So he has direct responsibility and control over IT infrastructure across the enterprise. So all of the CIOs at the individual centers subsequently report to him.    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    General Bolden. The only area that we have not done what the IG recommended was incorporating program IT systems under the chief information officer and we are looking at that. But in my opinion right now given what we have and given the funds we have, that might be a bridge too far because what we are talking about would be he would have responsibility for maintaining the Information Technology programs on the International Space Station or on Mars Curiosity or MAVEN. And that is something that I am not sure that any agency of the government has done that yet. We are looking at it. I am not saying we will not do it, but we are not there yet. So we have got a long way to go before we incorporate all of the----    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    General Bolden . Program and project IT infrastructure and assets under the Chief Information Officer.    Mr. Culberson. I will follow up with you.    General Bolden. But for everything else, he has the hammer.    Mr. Culberson. I will follow up with you individually on that.    General Bolden. Okay.    Mr. Culberson. Let me ask about one other, getting into a specific area, and then I want to recognize my good friend, Mr. Fattah, about plutonium production because we want to make sure that you have got the plutonium necessary for future missions.    The budget request is for $15 million for NASA to pay the Department of Energy to produce a supply of plutonium. And I understand that we are approaching the end of the life span for the machines that actually make the plutonium cakes, whatever they are called, that actually make the pellets, I assume.    Talk to us about that and the availability of plutonium for future missions, in particular the Europa mission and outer planets missions.    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, I will say you make an assumption that I want to not let you make and that is that Europa will be a nuclear powered mission. We are looking at----    Mr. Culberson. Still in the design phase?    General Bolden. Yes, sir. I just want to make sure that no one in my organization had led you to believe that----    Mr. Culberson. No.    General Bolden . We had made a decision yet----    Mr. Culberson. Still in the design phase. It is good to have that option.    General Bolden . On the power system for Europa.    Mr. Culberson. You are going to need that option for deep--    General Bolden. Yes.    Mr. Culberson . Space outer planets?    General Bolden. But in answer to your question for all NASA outer planets missions, for Mars 2020 and others that we currently have in our inventory in planning, we will have sufficient plutonium-238 to carry out those missions.    We continue to work with the Department of Energy (DOE) as you mentioned, as you alluded. A problem there on the DOE side is just the facilities and the condition of the facilities. We continue to work at an intermediate management level with the Department of Energy to make sure that the funds that we provide to them will, in fact, partially be used to make sure that the facilities are there so that they can make the plutonium that we need.    They are the producer of plutonium-238. Right now to my knowledge, NASA is the only user of plutonium-238, so it is very important to us that they get it right.    Mr. Culberson. If you could, would your folks get us a recommendation on what is necessary to make sure that that machinery is----    General Bolden. We will do that, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Culberson . Brought up to speed so you have got it for----    General Bolden. Yes.    Mr. Culberson . What I think we will ultimately need, a robust outer planets program?    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. Let me recognize my good friend, Mr. Fattah.    Mr. Culberson. Go ahead, please.    Mr. Culberson. Let me recognize Mr. Jenkins at this time.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Jenkins.    Mr. Culberson. And after we go through the Members, I want to be sure to recognize our colleague, Mr. Schiff, for a statement after the Members that were here first are recognized.    So I want to go at this time to Mr. Serrano.    Mr. Culberson. What is the $3 million a year for?    General Bolden. Let me find out specifically what it is for, but I think most of it is for programs and instruments and----    Mr. Culberson. Instrument time?    General Bolden. Instrument time or instrument modernization, because although the facility belongs to NSF, we frequently will have----    Mr. Culberson. Your customer?    General Bolden . Investigators who go in and actually build instruments that are used at the observatory.    Mr. Culberson. I know they need an upgrade on----    General Bolden. They do.    Mr. Culberson. Absolutely.    Mr. Culberson. Absolutely. Thank you.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Serrano.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Honda. We have been joined by Chairman Aderholt, another strong advocate and supporter of NASA and our manned program as I am, and it is my pleasure to introduce at this time the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. Aderholt.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Chairman Aderholt.    Let me recognize the young lady from Alabama, Mrs. Roby.    Mr. Culberson. Great question.    General Bolden. Okay. I thought I answered it, but I will try it again. Before you came in, not since you came in.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. I recognize the new ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, and a valued member of this subcommittee who has reserved his seniority, my good friend Mr. Schiff from California for any statement he would like to make.    Mr. Culberson. We would be happy to do so.    Mr. Culberson. We are going to continue to rely on your advice and guidance. Thank you very much.    Mr. Culberson. It was a privilege to work with you and the California delegation and my good friend Mr. Fattah. This whole committee is devoted to ensuring that NASA has the resources and the support that you need, sir, to do your mission. And I think as Mr. Honda said, or Mr. Serrano, that everything NASA does is just pure good. That is actually a nice way to look at it. And I would frankly love to see if you could, or somebody in your shop, find that survey that Sean O'Keefe did. Remember he retained a firm in Baltimore to do a name brand recognition goodwill survey of NASA and discovered that after the United States Marine Corps, General Bolden, that NASA had the highest positive name ID of any entity of the Federal Government. Am I remembering that correctly? That is just extraordinary. And we are here to help you and support you.    Mr. Culberson. And I would like to follow up on Ms. Roby's question and one that Mr. Aderholt asked, but first let me ask you a really important question that I have been meaning to ask, it deals with the manned space program. What is NASA's contingency plan in the event the Russians just say no more flights? Because obviously Vladimir Putin is reminiscent of Joe Stalin, he is very aggressive. We are going to continue to see the Russians attempt to expand their sphere of influence very aggressively and I do not see relations improving any time soon. If the Russians decide to just cancel our ability to use Russian vehicles to get to the International Space Station, what is your contingency plan?    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, it is important for me to state very clearly that while we are always looking at things that could go wrong, when you look at the realities on the ground, the relationship between NASA and Roscosmos remains very strong. Indications are that while our two governments and our political and diplomatic relations are not very good, indications when you look at fiscal dealings, availability of rocket engines, support for the International Space Station, continued support for launching crews and commitment to the International Space Station through 2024. In Russia that comes from the top. So the indications are that the rhetoric on the political side is not the same when you talk about space exploration.    Mr. Culberson. Right. And that----    General Bolden. However----    Mr. Culberson. Right.    General Bolden . We are always making plans for contingencies should something go wrong.    Mr. Culberson. That is my question.    General Bolden. There are always--Mrs. Roby mentioned on a bad day, on your worst day, what happens? On the worst day, the Russians decide that they are no longer interested in space exploration and that----    Mr. Culberson. Or carrying us to the space station.    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, I know this is going to sound like I have some crystal ball or something. We are an incredibly valuable partner for them, we are an indispensable partner for them in space exploration. If they made a decision that they no longer wanted to carry us to the International Space Station, they have subsequently made a decision that they no longer want to operate the International Space Station. That is just simple. It is because we operate, we are responsible for the day-to-day operations control of the International Space Station. They provide propulsion, but we are planning right now for them to, at some point take away the propulsion module that is there right now and we have other means to do that----    Mr. Culberson. But of course one of NASA's great strengths has always been that you plan for the unexpected.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. You always have redundant systems on your spacecraft, on the ground, you have the ability to fall back on another system if one fails.    General Bolden. Yes.    Mr. Culberson. And we need to know, the Congress needs to know----    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman----    Mr. Culberson . What is your plan in the event the Russians say we are not flying Americans to the space station anymore? Please answer that directly. You have got to be planning. I know that Mike Griffin, for example, did not want to fly the mission to the Hubble because the high inclination of the orbit was very different from the space station----    General Bolden. That was Sean O'Keefe.    Mr. Culberson. Sean O'Keefe.    General Bolden. I apologize for interrupting----    Mr. Culberson. No, no, make sure I got it right.    General Bolden . But I do not want my friend Mike Griffin to get----    Mr. Culberson. I vividly remember the Hubble needed to be serviced, but the concern was that if there was a problem we could not rescue those astronauts. And the agency always has a backup plan. So if you could, please, sir, tell us specifically what is your contingency plan? What is NASA's backup plan in the event the Russians say we are not flying Americans to the space station? Tell us you have one.    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, because this is a partnership and because Russian crew members would be equally at risk, our backup plan, if you want to talk about that, would be to mutually agree that the space station and space exploration is going to come to an end.    Mr. Culberson. So you have no backup?    General Bolden. We would make an orderly evacuation of the International Space Station. We have six seats, six crew members, all six guys. If you wanted to say, what happens on a really, really, really bad day? That the nations of the world decide that we are done with human space flight. You are forcing me into this answer, and I like to give you real answers and I do not want to try to BS anybody. If the nations of the world decided that human exploration is done, we have the capability to bring all six crew members home, because we have two vehicles, six seats, six crew members. That day----    Mr. Culberson. I know we have got the ability to get them back, but----    General Bolden. Getting them there. But that is the only issue, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Culberson. I urge you, it is vitally important that NASA have the--are you making contingency plans? Have you got people working on what if?    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, may I make sure I understand your question?    Mr. Culberson. Yes. So how do we continue--in the event the Russians say we are not carrying anybody else to the space station, your only plan is to evacuate it?    General Bolden. No, sir. And I thought I might confuse people. Let's take two things. Is the question what is the contingency plan to get people to the International Space Station, to get crews there?    Mr. Culberson. I understand we can evacuate folks, that is always essential. We want to make sure we can rescue people, you have got a lifeboat capability to get them home. But if the Russians said they are not carrying Americans anymore to the space station before commercial reaches full capability, you have no backup plan to continue to fly Americans to the space station until the commercial folks get up and running?    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, that is the plan.    Mr. Culberson. But you do not----    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, there is no capability to get anyone to the International Space Station today--well, there are two ways, but I do not use one--and that is Soyuz. That is the capability, that is the only capability any nation in the world has. So, to talk about what is the backup plan, what is the contingency plan, the backup plan, the very serious backup plan is to get moving and get Boeing and SpaceX certified, so that we can fly in 2017. That is the backup plan. Had we gotten the funding that was requested when I first became the NASA Administrator, we would have been all joyously going down to the Kennedy Space Center later this year to watch the first launch of some commercial spacecraft with our crew members on it. That day passed. I came to this committee and I said over and over, if we do not fund Commercial Crew----    Mr. Culberson. Had NASA not cancelled the Constellation Program, we would be ready to fly within 12 months.    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, that is not correct.    Mr. Culberson. If we----    General Bolden. And, Mr. Chairman, whoever told you that, that is not correct.    Mr. Culberson. It set us back.    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, any time you interrupt a program, it sets the nation back. So that is very true.    Mr. Culberson. Regardless of who is the President and regardless of who planned it, it was just a setback. I just wanted to establish it for the record and turn it over to my good friend Mr. Fattah. But it is a deep concern that we do not have a contingency plan to get our folks up in the event that the Russians----    Mr. Culberson. I am going to go to Mr. Fattah, it will be his time.    Mr. Culberson. You know how committed our committee has always been, we have always made sure to plus up and protect NASA's funding levels. And my mention of the cancellation of the Constellation, it is not political, it is a setback, no matter who is in the White House. And it is a real concern, the gap is a real concern. And I wish we did have a contingency, I wish there was some way for us to get there more quickly, and we will certainly do our best to help you do that.    I recognize Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. That is music to his ears.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. General Bolden, I want to go back to the SLS.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. Because I am concerned about the announcement that there has been slip in the launch date. There has been a delay. NASA has announced a delay in the second round of testing, a launch abort system. And the second round of testing looks like it is going to be held in 2018. I know that the budget request that the President submitted to the Congress asks for a 12 percent reduction in Orion and SLS funding, which concerns me because we have obviously got a serious deficiency in the ability to reach low Earth orbit. We certainly do not want to see any slippage in our ability to go beyond low Earth orbit, and I want to make sure the SLS program is robust, and that it achieves all of its milestones. We would like to get it in ahead of time.    Could you talk to us about what is necessary, what does this subcommittee and the Congress need to do, to help the SLS prevent any more slippages? What can we do to help make sure there are no more slippages? Why was the first launch slipped by a year?    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, if I can address the launch abort system first. That is not a part of SLS. That's a part of Orion, and your statement is a surprise to me. I will take it, for the record, I will have to go back and find out. My impression, my information, was we were getting ready to do the test of a part of the launch abort system, at least the motors, right over in a facility in Maryland sometime this year. But I will go back and verify where we are there. So that had no impact on anything about SLS.    What got us to where we are with SLS today when we say 2018 is its readiness to fly, was we went through the very formal process of milestone evaluations and everything, and when that was presented to Robert Lightfoot at a formal session that we have on programmatic decision making, then it came out that we, on our funding profile, SLS would be ready in 2018 at a certain price. And so that was the first time that we really knew for certain what its earliest launch date could be. But that is only SLS in the ground system.    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    General Bolden. That is what we are saying.    Mr. Culberson. And earlier I thought I heard you say at one point that an initial launch capability would be late 2018, and then I thought I also heard you say after 2018.    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, what I may have said, I may have confused things by referring to the system. I do not talk about launch of SLS. I talk about the launch of the integrated SLS and Orion to cislunar space. That means it is going to be EM-2. So that is what, when I talk about important, really important dates, because that is the way we are planning Orion. We are planning a launch availability of Orion for EM-2. Then we back away from that to say when EM-1 can be launched. You know, we are trying to figure out what is the earliest possible date that we can fly a human-rated mission on SLS and Orion. Once we determine that--and that is what will come to you all this summer.    Mr. Culberson. Okay. This summer you will get that to us?    General Bolden. The technical term for it is ``key decision point two.''    Mr. Culberson. That's----    General Bolden. Key decision point C.    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    General Bolden. So KDP-C. And that will not be until this Spring or Summer. And once that occurs, we will come back in to you and say, ``Here is the decision from KDP-C.''    Mr. Culberson. And NASA has told the subcommittee that increasing the fiscal year 2016 budget for SLS would not result in an advanced schedule or reduced life cycle cost for the program, and yet you have requested a 12 percent reduction in funding for Orion and SLS. That seems a little inconsistent. It seems to me we are not adequately funding SLS and Orion. How are you going to manage to stay on track if you are asking for a 12 percent reduction?    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, we think we are asking for adequate funds. We have a schedule that is built around what comes out of the key decision point milestones. The budget that we have in place today supports having the SLS, the launch vehicle, and the ground systems available in 2018, the present budget that we have in place today. We will have a budget request, that will be refined next year once we get the KDP-C for Orion, and I hope I am not confusing things here, but I will get clarification back to you.    Mr. Culberson. So you anticipate you will be able to give us an estimate of your first crewed mission by this summer?    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. Okay. Let me talk a minute about the Decadal survey priorities and see if my friend, Mr. Fattah has any follow up, we will probably submit the bulk of these for the record. The reason the Europa mission is so important is that it was the top priority of the Decadal survey last decade and the second priority this decade. And it, as you know, holds two to three times more liquid water than all the water on Earth and is the most likely place beyond Earth that if we are going to find life, it is most likely right there in our own backyard. That is why the planetary science community is so excited about it and why this committee has supported it so strongly.    The mission is still in its early planning phases, but I would like to know, if you could, talk to us about the Decadal survey in general. Are you satisfied that NASA is following the direction of Congress in funding and flying the top priority of the planetary Decadal survey? And talk to us about some of the other Decadals. To me, that is the gold standard. That is what NASA should be flying, the best recommendations of the best minds in the scientific community, whether it be planetary, heliophysics, earth science, or astrophysics.    General Bolden. Congressman, or Chairman, the best thing out of Decadal surveys is the fact that it does represent the thinking of the best minds in science, if you will, out of the National Research Council in a specific discipline. What we endeavor to do is follow the guidance of the Decadal survey, and we generally try to focus on the number one and number two areas there. We do not go down deep into the list, because the Decadal surveys give us multiple projects that can be flown.    As the way the planetary said this past time when Steve Squyres chaired it was, in fact, he made it very specific. The Decadal survey was very clear. If NASA is going to fly a subsequent Mars Rover after Curiosity and it is not going to cache, then don't do it. I mean, they were very specific. Go to Europa. It did not say to go to Europa and do this. But we have decided that we can put enough funds in the budget to mount another charge on Mars with Mars 2020, which we intend will be a caching mission.    Mr. Culberson. Yeah. The first step on that----    General Bolden. We will put samples in place----    Mr. Culberson. Right.    General Bolden . For a subsequent return to Earth and begin the formulation of a Europa mission. That is what we are doing. I hate the term robust, but in general terms, if you look at our planetary science program, Dawn is closing in on Ceres. We are still learning from the abundance of data that Dawn gathered in its year orbiting Vesta. New Horizons is closing in on Pluto and is already imaging Pluto. Juno will arrive at Saturn soon, and so--Jupiter, not Saturn, thank you very much.    Mr. Culberson. Yeah, I thought that----    General Bolden. No, no, no, that is, yeah. You are right.    Mr. Culberson. Well, this was the first Decadal survey I think they had ever done where they used independent outside cost estimates. Steve Squyres was very adamant and quite correct in making sure that we had realistic outside independent cost estimates on each one of those missions so that Congress would have a good idea of what they would actually cost.    Mr. Fattah, any follow up?    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Honda, any follow up?    Mr. Culberson. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Honda. There is no prohibition in current law against private companies mining----    General Bolden. Oh, I do not, Mr.--I get asked that all the time, and I need to find an answer. I do not----    Mr. Culberson. I do not believe there is. I think, of course, no nation----    General Bolden. I do not think there is, and that is the problem. Everyone is concerned, and so one of the fastest growing areas in the field of law today is space law.    Mr. Culberson. Well, no nation can claim sovereignty over a asteroid or the moon.    General Bolden. I think you are right.    Mr. Culberson. I think that we treat it just like Antarctica, however, though----    Mr. Culberson. We----    Mr. Culberson. We really do. We want to hear directly from you, and I hope also as a part of my legacy, our legacy together on this, I really want to see NASA focusing on those Decadal surveys. I really think that is the proper map, guideline, for future missions, relying on the best minds in the industry.    It is the law today that NASA follow the planetary Decadal survey. I would like to work with you, Mr. Fattah, in trying to expand that to help make sure that NASA is following the recommendations of the Decadal surveys in heliophysics and earth sciences and astrophysics as well.    And when it comes to the manned program, that is a bigger challenge, is how do you do a Decadal survey?                                           Tuesday, March 17, 2015.    Mr. Culberson. The subcommittee will come to order. Thank you for your service to the country and to the scientific community. We have, all of us on this committee over the years have been strong supporters of the sciences and space exploration. It is one of the great joys that I have had in Congress to get to help, serve on this committee to help the National Science Foundation and to ensure that the United States stays at the cutting edge of scientific discovery in the world. The impact that has I think on our quality of life for this generation and generations to come is self-evident. It is a real privilege for me to be here as the chairman and to work with my Ranking Member Mr. Fattah and other members of the subcommittee to do everything we can to help you achieve that mission. Recognizing of course that we are in a very difficult budget year with very tough constraints on the Congress to fulfill all that is asked of us.    We are entrusted with the task of allocating very scarce and precious, hard-earned tax dollars and it is vitally important, of course, that we be very careful to ensure that those hard-earned tax dollars are spent wisely and targeted very carefully. I can certainly think of few endeavors that are more noble or worthwhile than investing in the National Science Foundation. We do want to make sure, though, however, the money is well spent and not wasted. So I will probably spend some of my time in my questions talking about the Inspector General's report. I know you are still fairly new on the job. But I do have a lot of concerns about some of the things that the Inspector General pointed out and I want to go over some of those with you.    Your request for this year, for 2016 is $7.7 billion, about a five percent increase of $379 million over the current fiscal year. And I know that my colleague Mr. Fattah and other members of the subcommittee feel as I do, that we certainly want to make sure that we help you. But again, it is really going to be a difficult, a difficult budget year.    I am delighted to have you here, look forward to your testimony, and am happy to recognize my good friend Mr. Fattah for any opening statement he would like to make.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much. I certainly share Mr. Fattah's feelings. And I hope as a part of your testimony today you will talk to us about the other nations in the world and their investment. I think Mr. Fattah is exactly right, to focus our attention on that. Where are other nations in their investment in the sciences? In the pure sciences and engineering and where we are in relation to them.    Of course your statement will be entered into the record in its entirety, without objection. And we welcome your testimony. And we want to encourage you, if you could, to keep it within about five minutes as a summary. So thank you very much and we look forward to hearing from you today. Thank you, ma'am.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much, Dr. Cordova. And I want, if I could, to talk about the Inspector General's report from last September in particular. Because we are all of us in the subcommittee enthusiastic and very supportive of the work that you do, and the awarding of grants, and the work that you do in ensuring that the United States maintains its leadership role in the world in scientific research. Particularly in the pure sciences, which obviously include the earth sciences as well. But the budget environment in which we operate is so constrained that I am compelled to in the weeks ahead, follow up with a visit out to headquarters to talk to you about this. I am so concerned about what the Inspector General tells us about some of the deficiencies and the ability of the National Science Foundation to independently verify the cost of, for example the Daniel Inouye Solar Telescope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.    The Inspector General points out that after over four years of attempting to audit the proposed cost for construction of the telescopes there continues to be a lack of adequate documentation to determine if the costs are fair and reasonable. And the Inspector General also points out that the NSF's internal review, for example of the cost of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, it was not possible for you all to independently verify costs for any of the 136 proposal expenditures sampled, including approximately $145 million in direct materials. And after this critical report was issued the Inspector General points out the independent proposal and accounting system audits were clearly warranted to ensure the adequacy and proper accounting of the proposed costs, but instead of obtaining those audits NSF had a contractor perform a sufficiency review which is a less rigorous assessment than an audit. And in September, 2014 the Inspector General issued an alert memo expressing strong concern that NSF did not have sufficient information to establish a reasonable basis for the cost of the LSST project. They have been urging NSF for the last four years to strengthen accountability of your high dollar, high risk cooperative agreements for large construction, large facility construction projects. They point out, quite correctly, that you do indeed apply your highest level of attention and scrutiny to determine the scientific merits of the projects that you attempt to fund. But it is this independent assessment of the actual cost, to be able to verify that and strong audit procedures that the Inspector General has recommended apparently repeatedly. I understand you are still fairly new on the job but I would like to, in light of the difficult budget environment in which we operate, in light of this committee's strong support for the work that you do and our passion to help you do what you do, to assure our constituents that their money is being wisely spent, what have you done to comply with the Inspector General's recommendations?    Mr. Culberson. How about implementing the Inspector General's specific recommendations that you strengthen the accountability of your high dollar, high risk cooperative agreements and have essentially an independent proposal and accounting system audit in place? Have you begun to implement their recommendations that they have been recommending now for the last four years when it comes to your high dollar, high risk cooperative agreements for large construction projects?    Mr. Culberson. Okay, thanks. I will follow up on this with you. And I would love to come out and visit the headquarters and I want to learn more about what is going on with the moving of the headquarters. I want to recognize my good friend Mr. Fattah, thank you.    Mr. Culberson. I want to be sure to point out that the United States Marine Corps----    Mr. Culberson . Was the first to accept generally accepted accounting procedures.    Mr. Culberson. So they can be audited independently, and then the Navy followed suit. So the Marines are once again first on the beach.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. Mr. Jenkins.    Mr. Culberson. I know that Mr. Serrano would feel the same way about the Arecibo Telescope as well. And it is vitally important that we protect these assets, and at the very least that we are working to make sure that if indeed, they are shut down that we have replaced them. But it is a vitally important facility----    Mr. Culberson . At Green Bank as well as Arecibo.    Mr. Culberson. And my concern is the same as Mr. Jenkins, and I know everyone on the committee, when I ask about the Inspector General and the independent cost verification and the audits. It is because it is so important to protect your sterling reputation, and we do everything we can to make sure that the public understands that you are spending their hard earned money wisely and carefully and that you have done everything you can to ensure that, as Mr. Fattah said, it would certainly help with the Pentagon, you have got the ability to have independent outside cost verification and audits. So let me at this time recognize Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much. Mr. Jolly?    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. I completely agree that the work that you do and the grants that you award, the scientific research that is conducted by universities and researchers across the country, should be driven by the facts and the sciences and all of us should do everything we can to eliminate political considerations from those decisions. But as each one of us are responsible to our constituents to ensure that we are doing our best to ensure our constituents have faith that we are spending their money wisely. We are sort of, in a sense we are trustees of the public treasury. I do think it is important that the NSF do everything you can to be careful when the awards that you give out. Do not do anything to damage your sterling reputation. Always think about how would a taxpayer see this research? If a taxpayer reads about this on the front page of the New York Times, or reads about it, what would be the reaction of the average taxpayers to how you are spending their money? I think the reputation of the NSF is the greatest in the world and we will do everything on this committee to help protect you from political influence, whether it be from the right or the left. But do be keenly aware--you have a marvelous reputation to protect and be conscious that dollars we spend are hard earned and very precious and very scarce. From my perspective the most important thing is to ensure that none of the grants that you give are going to do anything to damage or diminish that sterling reputation, that you are following the facts and letting science lead the National Science Foundation----    Mr. Culberson . To discover the true nature of the universe. The cutting edge research that you have, we can continue to fund it and have the faith and trust of the taxpayers.    Mr. Culberson. And we will do it together, arm in arm. That is why I have also been such a big believer in the decadal surveys as the gold standard----    Mr. Culberson . As the North star by which we should guide our strategic plan for the decade ahead, whether it be in heliophysics, astrophysics, the earth sciences, the planetary sciences. I would love to--I really and sincerely ask the subcommittee's help and anybody out there to help us figure out how do you do a decadal survey for the manned space program? I do not know how you conquer--untie that knot. The decadal survey is designed to identify strategic goals for the decade ahead that are apolitical, based on the merits, in a peer-review process. That is what I know all of us on this subcommittee want to see the National Science Foundation do in the precious, scarce, hard-earned tax dollars that you are responsible for spending. We want to make sure that you are investing them carefully, following a strategic plan like that, that is apolitical and I think that is the intent.    Mr. Honda is correct to point out, we do not want to insert politics into your work. But, with President Kennedy's guidance to the nation, that it was in the national interest to go to the moon and do it first--we are delighted that you are leading the agency.    And I have taken too much time. I want to recognize my good friend from Alabama, Ms. Roby.    Mr. Culberson. Of course.    To follow up on those worthwhile questions, I would just like to ask you an open-ended question. Tell us a little bit about your own story, for the young ladies that came in with Ms. Roby and other young people watching you here today. Tell us a little bit about your early life and what led you to make the decision to become a scientist and what led you to Stanford and then what led you on to Caltech, two great universities.    Mr. Culberson. No, in thinking in terms of who is listening to you----    Mr. Culberson . These young ladies out here--what inspiration, guidance, advice can you give them and other young people?    Mr. Culberson. You could detect it visually?    Mr. Culberson. And you often do not know where the research is going to lead, it may look like it is a dead end or a rabbit trail, but it could lead to revolutionary new discoveries. And particularly in this era of interconnectedness with the extraordinary advances in communication using--I mean these devices are now everywhere. I know that the work you have done in high-energy astrophysics----    Mr. Culberson. They have only recently, because of the Internet, be able to tie gamma ray bursts when an amateur astronomer spots a visual----    Mr. Culberson . Outburst, because of the speed of the Internet. Telescopes all over the world and satellites are able to do today what you did intuitively as a graduate student, and shift the satellite or the ground-based telescope over----    Mr. Culberson. To see what a gamma ray burst is. Talk to us a little bit about and the value of the Internet and bringing-- tying together young people who you are talking to over the Internet and these young folks, that their work that they are doing as amateurs, can have a dramatic impact on----    Mr. Culberson. Yes.    Mr. Culberson. Beauty is an important part of the design.    Mr. Culberson. Soon on our wrists.    Mr. Culberson. Oh, no, please, continue.    Mr. Culberson. South by Southwest.    Mr. Culberson. Absolutely.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Jolly, any follow-up?    Mr. Culberson. We have a couple questions about NSF headquarters. I can certainly submit those for the record. I am concerned about the slippage in about six months and $60 million, according to the Inspector General. Does your budget request--I would ask very briefly--include that those costs that you are expected to incur as a result of the move and the----    Mr. Culberson. Your 2016 request does not include any of those increased costs that came about----    Mr. Culberson . As a result of the union negotiations?    Mr. Culberson. Do any of the--do you need all of the IT and furniture funds requested in 2016?    Mr. Culberson. There has been some discussion, some other members of Congress have suggested that we recommend specific science research directorate funding levels in your appropriations. We typically have not done so in the past, and would like you, if you could, to address that. Should Congress designate funds by science research directorate and how would that impact a peer-review process?    Mr. Culberson. However, grant requests were far smaller.    Mr. Culberson. Those are all very valid concerns and we do want to do everything we can do prevent politics from being inserted into your decision-making process. And I think it is also vital that we recognize that NSF, NASA, the scientific experts that space--the space exploration and scientific research that the nation does is a strategic asset to the entire country, and I think it is important for none of us--none of us should think that the work that you do or NASA does as either a jobs program or a parochial or a local issue; it is in the national interest. And by investing wisely and sufficiently in both the National Science Foundation and NASA, you are going to help all of those districts all over the country. So I think those are very valid concerns.    I would also like to ask about the--when you begin to put your budget together, for example, for next year in April--you are already beginning to kick that around right now--I assume at some point during the year, you have got to submit what you believe NSF will need next year to the Office of Management and Budget and then the final recommendation that we receive in Congress comes from OMB.    One thing that has always aggravated me is we do not get a recommendation directly from the scientific community when it comes to NASA or NSF; we are hearing from OMB, and we ought to be hearing from you. Legal Services submits their budget recommendation directly to the Congress.    Mr. Culberson. What would be your thoughts on having NSF--I would like to see NASA submit their recommendation directly to us and bypass OMB, so we are hearing the best recommendation of the minds in this space community, as to what this committee should fund. What do you think about having NSF just submit your budget recommendation based on the best recommendations of your team and following the decadal survey, directly to the Congress and bypass OMB?    Mr. Culberson. Speaking as a scientist. Mr. Culberson. It is difficult.    Mr. Culberson. That is true. But speaking as a scientist--    Mr. Culberson. I would sure like, as a matter of policy--    Mr. Culberson. As a believer in letting the scientists lead this work without political interference and then following and funding the best recommendations of the best minds in the business, I think it would be a wonderful thing for the future for us to find a way to have the National Science Foundation and NASA submit your recommendations on what you think your funding level needs to be directly to the Congress and bypass the green eye shades over at OMB, so we know what you need.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Fattah.    Mr. Culberson. I just want to thank you again for your service to the country. The National Science Foundation is a national treasure and we will do everything we can to help protect you, to fund you at a level that you need to continue to do the great work that you have been doing.    OMB could certainly submit their own recommendation, but I am certainly going to do everything I can to change the law so that we get the best recommendations and the best minds at NASA, the space exploration community, and the scientific community when it comes to NSF, so Mr. Fattah and I and our colleagues know you think you need for the future, not what necessarily--does not matter who is in the White House--what the bureaucracy thinks that you need, with as little political interference as humanly possible. I deeply appreciate your service.    Mr. Culberson. No matter who is in the White House. Thursday, March 26, 2015.    Mr. Culberson. The Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee will come to order.    I want to welcome everyone to this morning's hearing to discuss Federal investments in neuroscience and neurotechnology. Our ranking member, Mr. Fattah, has been a champion in Congress on this very important issue for many years. It has been my privilege to work with Mr. Fattah, my predecessor Frank Wolf on this very important topic, and I thank him for encouraging us to have this hearing today.    I would like to welcome our witnesses this morning, Dr. Jo Handelsman, associate director for science at the Office of Science and Technology Policy. We are delighted to have you with us here this morning, Dr. Handelsman, thank you. And Dr. James Olds, the assistant director for biological sciences at the National Science Foundation; and Zack Lynch, executive director of the Neurotechnology Industry Organization; and Dr. Steven Hyman, director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.    I look forward to your testimony on this vitally important and emerging field with exiting new developments taking place all the I time, and I thank you sincerely, Mr. Fattah, for helping put this together and making this possible and keeping the focus of this committee on this cutting-edge and extraordinarily important research, and I am looking forward to----    Mr. Culberson . Your remarks, sir.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Fattah.    This is an extraordinary and exciting subject. We are honored and privileged to have each one of you with us here today to help keep us apprised of the cutting-edge work that is being done in the United States and elsewhere in the world.    And we will of course enter your written statement into the record without objection, and would welcome you to summarize your statement as best you can.    Thank you, and we will start with you, Dr. Handelsman. Thank you.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much, Dr. Handelsman.    Dr. Olds, we look forward to hearing from you, and, you know, not only is your work so important on helping veterans and traumatic brain injury, it is also, I think, relevant and it will be interesting to know what--if at some point during the questioning you might be able to offer us any insight about how would you potentially spot someone like this pilot of the German aircraft that might be on the brink of doing something terrible that it looks like his act was a deliberate act. And it may indeed be work that is done by--by scientists like yourselves that might be able to help airlines spot something like that about to happen.    So we look forward to your testimony, Dr. Olds. Thank you.    Mr. Culberson. Dr. Olds, thank you very much.    As we go through the--in your opening statements, I would particularly be grateful and we may do--we will certainly do some of this in the questioning as well, talk to us about some of the successes. We are very supportive of the investment. That is why we are here today. Very supportive of the collaboration. That is why we are here today. Really appreciate the work that you are doing. Delighted to hear about the collaboration and the money that has been invested in the past and that needs to be invested in the future. We are supportive of that. That is why we are here today. Tell us about some of the exciting new discoveries. I mean, that is where we really--that is what we want to hear about today, and what--what is working and what is not, and where, then, do we need to focus our attention, as you could, if you don't mind, in your opening statement? We will get into that in some of the questionings too, but I would love to hear it in the opening. Thank you.    Mr. Lynch.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Lynch.    Fascinating. Cognitive computing is exciting, but I share some of the fear of others in the idea of artificial intelligence. We want to avoid a Skynet situation. Dr. Hyman. Thank you. Look forward to hearing from you.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much, Dr. Hyman.    It is an extraordinarily exciting field of research, and you think about the size of the human genome and how little we know about what those genes do. We don't know, what, over 90--what is the percent--what percentage of the genes in the genome do we know what they----    Mr. Culberson. I suspect God doesn't do anything that doesn't have a purpose.    Mr. Culberson. Absolutely.    Absolutely fascinating, but I noted also, and you didn't mention this in your summary, Mr. Lynch, about the importance of us making sure that we have got legislation encouraging companies to invest in orphan drugs, which is something you mentioned obliquely, but----    Mr. Culberson . Really, really important because a lot of these medications and these problems are--involve populations that may be too small for the companies to be able to see that there is an economic benefit, and that is just vitally important.    Some studies have mentioned that many neurological disorders stem from a misfolding of a protein in the brain which can lead to a cascade of effects that result in ALS or Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurological diseases. And traumatic brain injuries apparently also cause a similar misfolding of proteins with a cascading effect in the brain.    Has it been solidly established that this protein malfunction is a potential root cause of these neurological diseases. And if we have indeed identified the root cause of these issues, could you tell us where we are in finding a cure and being able to either stop or reverse the cascade effect in the brain when these proteins----    Mr. Culberson. And then some of the folding, I understand, is just a result of random chance about where they are positioned in the cell. They don't have enough elbow room to fold correctly.    Mr. Culberson. So complex, in fact, you have had to crowdsource it. I have signed up for that project to do the protein folding, and I let the computer run it in the background, and you have really got--I also signed up for the one classifying galaxies, which is--that is what I do for fun.    Mr. Culberson. But it is so vast a problem you literally--I am sorry.    Mr. Culberson. I mean, the scale of the problem is so huge; crowdsourcing is one of the best ways and the size of the----    Mr. Culberson. My sister-in-law's family has it.    Mr. Culberson. She is clear, but her sister is not.    Mr. Culberson. Or injury.    Mr. Culberson. The poison you were referring to could also be thought of, I guess, in terms, perhaps, of like inflammation. I have been a subscriber to the Journals Nature and Science for over 20 years and don't pretend to understand all of it, but I read them cover to cover and----    Mr. Culberson. Yeah. I know, but it is fascinating and noted that there was an article I know a year or two ago about the effects of chronic inflammation as a root cause of cancer, for example, as just a constant source of irritation or causing damage that then triggers an uncontrollable cascading mutation of cells. Is that similar to what you are talking about here?    Mr. Culberson. Conceptually.    Mr. Culberson. But to prevent the inflammation is to prevent the underlying----    Mr. Culberson . And the subsequent problem.    One of my other passions--I am going to turn it over to Mr. Fattah--a long-term passion of mine that I hope in the time I am privileged to chair this subcommittee and work with you and all our other members is to identify--be able to identify in the future a genetic problem like that in an unborn child through the amniotic fluid and whip up a protein fix that you could then inject back into the amniotic fluid which the child would then breathe and repair and cure the child's disease before she is born. So that is absolutely possible. Isn't it?    Mr. Culberson. CRISPR----    Mr. Culberson. When that DNA shows up, the molecular scissors go into action and chop it up.    Mr. Culberson. Zombie immune system. That is nice. Got to use that.    Mr. Culberson. Can you plagiarize that?    Mr. Culberson. Zombie immune system.    Mr. Culberson. Huntington's or----    Mr. Culberson. Right.    Mr. Culberson. Texas Medical Center, which I am proud to represent, I have been pushing them for years on this. And they tell me it is possible.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. Thank you for letting me take so much time, Mr. Fattah.    Mr. Culberson. Yeah. Where we need to focus our efforts. That is a great question, probably the best question----    Mr. Culberson. Yes.    Mr. Culberson. Where?    Mr. Culberson. Oh, please.    Mr. Culberson. You see that as one of the root causes of a lot of things----    Mr. Culberson. I think a big part of this is the cognitive computing, I guess, that you mentioned earlier.    Let me ask Dr. Olds, if I could, on behalf of the National Science Foundation, to talk to us about the number of grant proposals you receive in the neuroscience discipline.    And of those that you receive, how many does the NSF fund? Just ballpark. And give us a--Mr. Fattah and I an idea of where the most productive areas might be for us to help you target.    Mr. Culberson. Ballpark percentage that you are able to----    Mr. Culberson. Oh, please. That is the benefit of this. It is free flowing.    Mr. Culberson. It is fascinating.    Mr. Culberson. Right.    Mr. Culberson. Fascinating. It is extraordinary. And the advances come from you all sparking off each other; so, I know how important the collaboration is.    And you really often don't know where the advance is going to come, and it is up to the Federal government to invest in this basic research because the private sector just--either cannot--they just simply don't have the resources. You can't stay with it. You have got to make sure your shareholders' expectations are met in the shorter term.    So it is up to us to invest in a lot of these. It may just turn out to be dead-end rabbit trails, but otherwise wouldn't get done.    I wanted to ask Dr. Olds about supercomputing. And National Science Foundation had funded Blue Waters, one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.    And, if you could, talk to us about how this resource is being used to support brain research. And how is the United States holding up in the ongoing effort to build the biggest, fastest, best computer on Earth?    Mr. Culberson. The Japanese leapfrogged us, I know, recently, but that is--I just want to make sure we are the ones standing at the cutting edge of that work.    Mr. Culberson. Well, how do we deal with the--once the computer becomes self-aware and can learn--you mentioned cognitive computing--it opens up all kinds of wonderful possibilities, but, also, terrifying possibilities as well.    Talk to us a little bit about, if you could, each one of us, some of your personal concerns about how we are going to deal with that when we cross that threshold. You know, some of the greatest minds in the country continue to talk about the concern about AI, that it may not be a happy experience.    Mr. Culberson. Well, I am not questioning that.    Mr. Culberson. You know, that is why we are here. Very supportive of the work. But I just think, with your talent at this table, it is important to talk about the ethical challenges and what would lie ahead for the human race if we actually develop a computer that is able to function at the level of the human brain, can learn a task----    Mr. Culberson. Well, that day is coming soon. And we have got a panel of great talent here. I just want to get your thoughts about AI and cognitive computing and what are we going to do when we hit that threshold.    Mr. Culberson. Right. They just called a vote, and I want to let Mr. Fattah close up.    But I really would also like to ask about what is this device and the instant gratification that it brings doing to our kids and the evolution of our minds.    Because this is changing us. And the human instinct for instant gratification--you see the Google searches. If people don't get what they find within a few nanoseconds, they are switching. It is altering behavior, and I think it is really worrisome.    Can you talk to us a little bit about that, any one of you who want to dive in.    Mr. Culberson. Well, in particular, these things.    Mr. Culberson. Sometimes I want to hit it with a hammer.    Mr. Culberson. Physical changes. What about behavioral? Then I want to let Mr. Fattah close up on this. But, I mean, he has gotten me on another question.    But it worries the heck out of me because you don't see kids playing in the yard anymore and looking for bugs or doing things like all normal kids should be.    Mr. Culberson. But you are seeing changes in human behavior with this instant access to information and gratification----    Mr. Culberson. That is a social behavior headline no one wants----    Mr. Culberson. This is a team effort.    Mr. Culberson. It so important, and it is something we are arm in arm on, as I have been a member of the subcommittee since I first got on Appropriations in 2003 and always dreamed of having the privilege of being able to chair it to be able to help make sure that these--as Mr. Jefferson said, he liked the dreams of the future better than the memories of the past.    And I will continue to do everything I can to help make sure that these dreams of the future come true from our work that we do arm in arm----    Mr. Culberson . And remembering, also, that Mr. Jefferson liked to say that liberty is the firstborn child of science, which is absolutely true.    So it is exciting and so worthwhile. And we will continue to work together, Chaka, to make sure that we are providing you the research, the support that you need, and get out of the way as much as possible.    Because, as a Texan, we also understand that the less government, the better, and get out of the way, and particularly when it comes to the sciences, let you follow the facts.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you for making this happen.    Mr. Culberson. Maybe a lot sooner.    Thank you very much.    And the hearing is adjourned. Thank you.
