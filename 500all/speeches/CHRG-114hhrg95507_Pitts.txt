    Mr. Pitts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your testimony. Good to see you. Charlie Bass, the Secretary, welcome.    Mr. Atkinson, please tell us a bit about your R and D process, how does Alstom Grid go about bringing R and D to the market?    Mr. Pitts. Thank you.    Mr. Christiansen, you stated that your technology is source agnostic architecture that helps balance the grid. What is the importance of being source agnostic?    Mr. Pitts. Mr. Ivy, how do the advanced grid technologies being deployed by Lakeland Electric better empower consumers to save energy and reduce their electricity bills?    Mr. Pitts. OK. Mr. Kamen, in your testimony you noted the need to promote renewable energy technology while ensuring continued viability of the utility-based model, siting Germany as a cautionary tale. How do you think these 2 seemingly opposing objectives can be achieved?    Mr. Pitts. My time has expired. Thank you.
