    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Serrano.    Now we will turn to General George for your testimony. If you could keep it in the neighborhood of 5 minutes, it will allow us time for questions. The floor is yours.    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, thank you very much.    Mr. Crenshaw. Now we will turn to Ms. Olson.    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, thank you both for those words. Let me start by thanking you both for being here.    Inspector George, we heard from you about how the IRS could take some actions to be more efficient. They have got limited resources. We know that.    And, as Ms. Olson pointed out, I have to question--I think we all question--how they are allocating and, frankly, how they are prioritizing the resources they have.    I think there is a lot of misperception in the media. And I want to be, you know, clear. This subcommittee is not here to punish the IRS. We are just trying to hold them accountable.    We all want to be more efficient and more effective. And that is what we are trying to do, as you point out, and that includes everything from justifying the taxpayer-funded dollars to the highest level.    So let me ask you all. You all have kind of talked about some things that you have uncovered and suggested. I ask both of you all: How is the IRS receiving these thoughts? Are they implementing some of your recommendations? And, maybe, what do you see as the most immediate that they can do to really help in this 2015 tax season?    Could you start, General George? Just how is that being received? Because you all have really thrown out some pretty good ideas and save a lot of money and be more efficient. Is it working? What do you hear? How are they doing?    Mr. Crenshaw. Do you sense that some of the thoughts that you have outlined to us--are they trying to implement those? Are they pretty receptive to some folks that say, ``Here is a better way to run the railroad''?Monday he called me at 5 o'clock in the afternoon to indicate that the initial response they had to a recommendation that we made to them to better conduct business--that he reversed--you know, they--the staff pushed back. He changed that view and adopted our recommendation 100 percent.    Mr. Crenshaw. Great.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Ms. Olson.    Mr. Crenshaw. Great. Great. Growth and change are difficult at times.    Let me ask one quick question that has to do kind of with this Affordable Care Act because I know that is creating a burden on the IRS.    You know, the Administration delays the employer mandate from time to time. And they have extended the enrollment period, I guess, this year. And they are struggling on the front end of the Affordable Care Act. But I have always had concerns for a long time about the back end that might be even in worse shape.    And I guess we all saw what happened. The Administration announced that 800,000 low- to moderate-income households were sent incorrect tax information, or these new 1095s, and that is about 20 percent of all the people that receive subsidies under the ACA.    Then I also read that, I think, 50,000 people filed their tax returns based on the wrong information as part of that 800,000.    And then I learned last night that the IRS has already said that they are not going to pursue the collection of any additional taxes from the estimated 50,000 people that already filed a return based on the incorrect information. So I guess the IRS has decided they will just turn a blind eye to that.    So I was just wondering, have you asked about that yet or have they talked to you about that? You know, how do they just ignore this situation? Is that something that you are going to ask about or have asked about?    Mr. Crenshaw. I guess that will all be added to the tax gap. But I look forward to hearing what they have to say.    Mr. Serrano, do you have some questions?    Mr. Crenshaw. Sure.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Graves.    Mr. Crenshaw. One more.    Mr. Crenshaw. Yeah. That is quite a number. General George, I can remember when that question was asked, ``How do we prevent this fraud?'' and the answer was, ``File early.'' We have got to do better than that.    Mr. Amodei.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Yoder.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, and also, I remind the members that the Commissioner will be coming before the subcommittee and a lot of these questions can be directed to him. I think for those that missed the opening statement, I think Ms. Olson and Inspector George really brought out some of the things that they are working on in ways to improve and that is kind of their job, and we appreciate that very much. Let's go to Ms. Herrera Beutler.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. I would like to now recognize one of the new members of the subcommittee, Mr. Rigell, who is from Virginia.    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, you are almost out of time.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. Yeah, we have taken a little liberty with the clock today and I think everybody has had a chance to ask as many questions as they might want. I know Mr. Serrano has another question.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Serrano, and I thank everyone. I have got some more questions, but I will submit them to the record, and I know others as well. But let me again thank you all for being here, because I know you have got a tough job. As you stated your testimony, there are things that you are doing to try to help us. We are all trying to help the IRS even though the IRS has never been one of the most endearing agencies to most people in America. And it seems like when we started all this, when Commissioner Werfel was the new guy, and I asked him, I said, do you think the IRS has betrayed the trust of the American people? He said yes. I think there is a lot that goes into restoring that trust, and quite frankly, I don't think complaining about the lack of money, or not answering the telephone, or things like that, is the best way to restore trust. But I do think the things that you all have come up with, the recommendations that you see every day, if the Commissioner were to implement those, I think it will help. The Commissioner is going to come before us, and we will have a lot of questions for him. But you have done a great job, a great service, in the work that you do to let us know your view of the world as it relates to the IRS. We want to do a better job and ultimately we want the IRS to do a better job. So again, thank you for being here today. This meeting is adjourned.                                         Wednesday, March 18, 2015.    Mr. Crenshaw. Good morning, everyone. The meeting will come to order.    I want to welcome the Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen to our committee here today to discuss the 2016 IRS budget request.    This is a busy time for the IRS. And so, Mr. Commissioner, we appreciate you being here today to share your testimony and answer any questions we might have.    Now, for 2016, the IRS is requesting a massive $2 billion or 18-percent increase. Commissioner, last month, you told the Senate Finance Committee that the IRS was not asking for a budget increase but just for the money that was taken away from you, presumably, by this committee. And it came as a surprise to me to learn that you might believe the IRS is entitled to $13 billion because entitlements are for programs like Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid.    National security, it is a Constitutional duty, but even the Department of Defense has to appear before the Appropriations Committee. They have to justify their budget request. They have to subject themselves to the Congressional oversight before Congress provides DOD with any funds.    And so IRS has to do the same.    Now, contrary to what we all read in the media from time to time about this Committee, we are not here to simply punish the IRS. We are here to hold the IRS accountable for the use of the taxpayer dollars. We deliberately--yes, we deliberately lowered the IRS funding to a level that would make the IRS think twice about what you are doing and why you are doing it because you don't have a single dime to spare on anything frivolous or foolhardy or even mediocre.    Now, the IRS should focus on its core mission of providing taxpayer services such as processing returns and issuing refunds, providing customer service like answering the telephone, and catching tax cheats. If the IRS wants more solid and sustainable funding, then the IRS needs to show Congress and the American taxpayers that it can manage its funding responsibly and administer the Tax Code in an objective way.    But, unfortunately, it seems like we read week after week after week about one form of IRS mismanagement or another, such as overlooking 50,000 tax returns filed using incorrect information; hiring former employees with known conduct problems; paying bonuses to tax-delinquent employees; frequent and costly executive travel; lacks oversight of purchase cards; lavish spending on conferences; and last but not least, applying extra scrutiny to certain tax-exempt organizations.    And then, to add insult to injury, the budget request seeks to eliminate some of the key provisions that we on this committee added to help the IRS move past this series of mismanagement. A provision that says you cannot target, well, that is not in the request. A provision that requires videos to be reviewed for appropriateness, that is gone. A provision that requires compliance with the Federal Records Act, that is gone. A provision that guards against excessive conference spending, that is not in the request. There is a provision that we put in to uphold the confidentiality of tax returns, that is gone.    Now, to me, these are just commonsense good government reforms that we put in the bill to help restore the trust in the IRS. So I hope that when you submit your 2017 budget that you might think about adding them back to your budget request.    Now, we talk about doing more with less around here. These are tough economic times. And, Commissioner, I have heard your complaints about doing less with less--it is hard to do less with more. But I want to remind you that additional dollars are not the only solution. In fact, last month, the Government Accountability Office, or the so-called GAO, a nonpartisan agency, said, quote, ``Although resources are constrained, IRS has flexibility in how it allocates resources to ensure that limited resources are utilized as effectively as possible, magnifying the importance of strategically managing operations to make tough choices about what services to continue providing and which services to cut,'' end quote.    So, instead of asking for the money that has been taken away from you, what I would hope that you would do is to study your budget line by line, prioritize your activities, and reengineer your business processes to deliver these priorities. This is your opportunity to show this committee and to show all Americans that it is no longer business as usual with the IRS. This is an opportunity to show that you have shaken things up and turned things around. We hope you will do that.    And, finally, I just want to highlight some landmark legislation that was enacted last year, called the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, or the so-called ABLE Act. The ABLE Act opens the door to a brighter future for millions of Americans with disabilities, allows them to set up a tax-free savings account similar to a 529 to save for college.    Now, States are responsible for administering this program and some of the States have already started the legislative process to create these ABLE accounts, but the IRS is required to issue regulations by June 19. So I fully expect the IRS is going to meet that statutory guideline.    So, again, let me thank you, Mr. Commissioner, for being here today.    Let me turn to my distinguished ranking member, Mr. Serrano, for any comments he might have.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    I now would like to recognize the Chairman of the full committee, Mr. Hal Rogers, for any opening statement he might make.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And now I would like to recognize the Commissioner for an opening statement. If you could keep that in the neighborhood of 5 minutes, it will give us more time for questions and answers. The floor is yours.    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, thank you very much.    Let me start the questions. You know, I mentioned the ABLE Act in my opening statement. You mentioned ABLE Act. That is something new that you are going to have to do to write the rules and regulations by the middle of June; that is 6 months away. Now, as you probably know, the ABLE Act is patterned after what we call a 529, that is where parents can set aside money in a tax-free savings account, let it grow, and as long as they use it to go to college.    So it seems to me that writing regulations that are consistent with what you already have in terms of the 529 shouldn't be a massive undertaking. So I hope that you can work on that and get that done in a timely fashion. Because on the other hand, there is something called the 501(c)(4) regulations that are not statutory mandated, but if you recall, when we had all the problems with the extra scrutiny that some of the tax-exempt organizations were getting, IRS decided they were going to redraft the 501(c)(4) regulations.    And, as you know, the regulations were put out there, and there is a lot of discussion about that. And at the end of the day, there were over 150,000 comments. And that regulation tended to offend just about everybody, on the left, on the right, nobody liked it. And so I guess that has been set aside. But one of the concerns that people had was that if those regulations suppressed what people would consider to be freedom of expression, that wouldn't be a good thing. And they were criticized, again, from the left and the right, because of that.    So now that as you, I understand it, are going to redraft those rules and regulations, the concern was in 2013 that they were going to be out there right about election time and people would be concerned about how they would be perceived under this new regulation. Now we are past 2014. Now 2016 elections stare us in the face. And there is some concern that are we going to go through this process again? Are we going to put that regulation out there right about election time? And people are going to be concerned that somehow these new regulations are going to impact their ability to be involved in the political process.    So my question is, what is the plan on this 501(c)(4) regulations? Are they going to be submitted right about election time and have a period of comment, or are they going to be put off until after the elections? Can you tell us exactly what is the plan on this next draft for the rules?    Mr. Crenshaw. And I appreciate all that, but just in terms of the timeframe----    Mr. Crenshaw. But you don't know, you don't have a timeframe to say we are going to publish the next draft in the next 6 months or next year? You got any idea of when you are going to do that?    Mr. Crenshaw. Yeah, I understand that.    Mr. Crenshaw. The only thing you can tell me is that you hope it won't impact the 2016 elections, but we don't know that for sure?    Mr. Crenshaw. I appreciate that, but I also want to say, the ABLE Act that we talked about, that is a statutory mandate. Congress said go do that by June, okay. We didn't tell you to go do the 501(c)(4). You want to do that, and I hope you will get your priorities right, do what the statute says, and then if you have time, you can do the 501(c)(4)s somewhere along the way.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you very much. I am out of time. I want to turn to my Ranking Member Mr. Serrano for any questions.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. And let me just remind you, my distinguished Ranking Member, that with the appropriations that IRS received last year, they collected more revenue than ever in the history of the United States of America. Just a thought.    And the other thing I would just say, and I don't want to get into an exchange, but the 501(c)(4) regulation don't have anything to do with who is the President. They have to do with whether or not, I think, that first draft, a lot of people felt like was going to put a wet blanket on political participation. I don't think anybody wants that to happen. So I think they are working on that, and I am sure they will do well.    I want to recognize Chairman Rogers now.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you very much.    And now I would like to turn to Mr. Quigley.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Rigell.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Bishop is recognized.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Graves.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Yoder.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    I see that we have been joined by the distinguished Ranking Member of the full committee, Mrs. Lowey. So I would like to recognize her for any questions she might have.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Ms. Herrera Beutler.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. I think we have a little time for some additional questions.    I don't know, Mr. Serrano, do you have additional questions? Please.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Graves.    Mr. Crenshaw. Ms. Herrera Beutler, do you have any more questions?    Let me just--a couple of quick questions before we go. And we talked a lot about fraud, the $5.8 billion. And you mentioned that the administration wants to move up the W-2s. And then you said maybe if we waited later on, after we have all of the information, then process those returns, you would have more information and maybe there would be less fraud. But, on one hand, I have always--I have thought about that. The taxpayers might not like that. They love getting their refunds early.    Mr. Crenshaw. But is that something you would really think about, now?    Mr. Crenshaw. You mentioned maybe one of the problems is that all of a sudden you will have to process all of those at the end. But I imagine you staff up when you are, you know, processing now. If you staffed up a little bit later. But, obviously, there is a concern of the taxpayers, I file my tax returns, I want to get my refund.    Mr. Crenshaw. But what is the biggest objection to that, to say--rather than you call it chasing a file, but say you file your tax return and then maybe sometime 3 months after that, when all this information has come in and you can even do a better job of weeding out the fraud, what prevents you from suggesting that?    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, do they have to be in the last couple of weeks?    Mr. Crenshaw. I mean--and this is, I would say, after you file returns in April, right, and right now if you file a return early, you can get a refund pretty quick. But what if it were, you file your return by April 15, but you are not going to get a refund until, let's say, 3 months later because you got more time to do all of the due diligence.    Mr. Crenshaw. And it might even help with the earned income tax credit. If you had delayed refunds, whatever, it might give you a little more time to----    Mr. Crenshaw . Deal with that because that is, like, $6 billion and $19 billion and somehow if you could----    Mr. Crenshaw. You know, part of that, it might be worth taxpayers saying, well, we will wait a little bit.    Mr. Crenshaw. Maybe their taxes will go down if we--if we collected all those.    The last question real quick, and this is just--this is--and I am just curious about this. When I read about the 50,000 folks that filed tax returns based on the incorrect information they got, I think there were 750,000 people that got that incorrect information. The 50,000 that filed, you all decided, well, if they owed additional taxes or whatever, you are just going to kind of let that go.    I just wonder, is that going to be a problem? What about the next batch? I mean, all the people that got incorrect information, the next 700,000 that file, is there any kind of due process issue with them? Or how do you decide we are just going to--they got wrong information, they filed a return, maybe they got a refund, maybe they are going to owe back taxes? On the other hand, maybe they will--you know, it might be a wash. But how do you make that decision?    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, thank you. And let me--any other questions?    Mr. Crenshaw. Unless we simplify the Tax Code and then----    Mr. Crenshaw. Well, thank you. And let's just end on a positive note. Let me thank the Commissioner. He has been working with a group called the Free File Alliance.    Mr. Crenshaw. And they just entered into an agreement, a 5-year agreement, that about 70 percent of all the taxpayers are going to have access to filing their taxes free. That is something he has been working on.    And I want to congratulate you for that. Thank you for that. And thank you for being here today.    And we will all adjourn the meeting right now.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    And now I would like to turn to the ranking member of the full committee, my good friend Nita Lowey, for her opening statement.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Secretary, they have called a vote. There are 11 minutes left. There is plenty of time if you would like to take a few minutes to make an opening statement. We would be happy to hear that. And then we might take a brief recess and come back. But, please, the floor is yours, as long as you don't go more than 5 minutes.    Mr. Crenshaw. If that is okay with you. Let me ask one question, and then I think with 5 minutes to go, since we have a series, we will all probably have to get up and leave, but I think it will take less than 30 minutes.    Let me just ask you about the Financial Stability Oversight Council that we talk a lot about, the FSOC. You remember last year I asked you some questions because you are the chairman of the FSOC, and it seems to me just over this last year that more confusion has been added. A lot of people are trying to do the right thing, but they don't know exactly where they stand. The question of transparency, especially, has been raised.    FSOC ought to bring stability to the financial markets, but it seems to be working the other way. And I have told you and I have told SEC Chair White that I think the individual regulatory agencies are actually better equipped than FSOC to handle some of these things.    But, for instance, if the primary focus is to identify and ensure systemic risks are adequately and appropriately addressed, wouldn't that be better than just designating SIFIs, and do you give companies the ability to address some of those systemic concerns before they get designated as a SIFI? And if not, why don't you do that?    And finally, tell me why it is better to have this new Council as opposed to an agency that was set up, like the SEC, to address those kind of risks. Just touch on that about how the FSOC is actually working out.    Mr. Crenshaw. Just on that point, do you think that the SIFI designation, is that appropriate for non-bank entities?    Mr. Crenshaw. But, for instance, if you get designated a SIFI, that can be costly. And if you designate, for example, an asset manager or a mutual fund, then they will have costs involved and they will pass those on to their investors. And a lot of those are people that are just saving for college or saving for retirement.    And under Dodd-Frank, these nonbank SIFIs, they can be assessed to help pay for the resolution of the failing financial institutions, banks, that is what we think of. So you have got these provisions, but when you designate an entity such as a mutual fund as a SIFI, then that means these fund investors, they might be on the hook for bailing out the banks who, I guess, were the bad actors in that case.    So, is that something you all have thought about when you designate a nonbank as a SIFI? Some investors impacted might be average Americans who are relying on their investments and they might end up on the hook to pay for some bad actions of a bad bank.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you. I just hope you keep in mind the costs and benefits of these designations.    There are a couple of minutes left. I think it would be good to recess now. There is one amendment, a motion to recommit, and final passage. Should be less than 30 minutes. I know the members have a lot of questions, and I appreciate you working with us. So let's stand in recess. And come back as fast as you can.    Mr. Crenshaw. We will reconvene the hearing now. And I would like to recognize Ranking Member Mr. Serrano for questions.    Mr. Crenshaw. Mr. Graves.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mrs. Lowey.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Rigell.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Bishop.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    Mr. Womack.    Mr. Crenshaw. Sure.    Mr. Crenshaw. Mr. Secretary, I would suggest when you are asked what will happen to interest rates, you simply respond they will go down, they will stay level, they will go up, but not necessarily in that order.    Mr. Fattah.    Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you.    And let me ask you one final question. You have been very generous with your time. But I want to ask you about the way the IRS implements regulations, about two regulations. One was statutorily mandated. I mentioned in my opening statement about the ABLE Act. The States are going to administer that, but the IRS has to write some rules and it is supposed to be ready by July. And if you know a little bit about that bill, it is going to bring peace of mind to millions of Americans that are facing these challenges of disabilities. So a lot of States are already moving ahead to begin to administer this kind of program. And, just from your perspective, is that something, the July deadline that is in the statute, will that be able to be met?    Mr. Crenshaw. I appreciate that. Because, again, this is one of those pieces of legislation that is going to help millions of Americans.    Mr. Crenshaw. The other thing is a regulation that I don't really care if you finish, and that has to do with the 501(c)(4)s. When it was promulgated, it had, like, 150,000 comments. It was pulled back. And as I understand it from the Commissioner, there was some concern that it would be kind of a wet blanket on the 2014 elections and it wasn't repromulgated. I guess it is being worked on again. And I think the Commissioner said that he doesn't want it to look like it will impact even the 2016 elections. So it sounds like that is not on the front burner anymore.    Have you got a view on the timing of that? Again, I don't think that is statutory mandated. It is something that you all want to write and promulgate and have comments, but it doesn't sound like it is going to happen anytime soon.    Mr. Crenshaw. Firestorm.    Mr. Crenshaw. Great. Well, thank you very much. And thank you for your time today. You have got a big job, tough job. And if we can work together, we would like to do that.    Again, thank you for being here today.    Mr. Crenshaw. The hearing is adjourned.
