    Mr. Kelly. The gentleman's time has expired.    I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes for questions.    Mr. Kelly. Very good. And to follow up on a different line of questions, how many market access requests by U.S. producers or companies are pending at APHIS currently?    Mr. Kelly. Absolutely. As a part of that also, we just would like to know the average amount of time it takes for a request to be processed, and the success rate of those that are processed. If you have any thoughts now, I would be glad to hear them, but if not, we will wait on the report.    Mr. Kelly. I would appreciate shedding a little more light on what happens to shipments once they pass, or a contaminant is detected, what happens to that shipment? Is it destroyed, are the contents treated and then brought on? Can you kind of talk about what we do when we detect?    Mr. Kelly. Thank you.    And, Mr. Harriger, final question from me. In your testimony, you mentioned there are ports where there are no CBP agricultural specialists, but other CBP officers are cross-trained to detect agricultural items of interest. Can you describe or talk a little more in-depth about how we cross-train and how many are cross-trained, and if that works or not?
