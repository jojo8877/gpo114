    Mr. Cardenas. So thank you very much for enlightening us with your information, and hopefully we'll learn more about what's going on in the streets and corridors of your side of the world.    But in a nutshell, if you could please expand on at least one example of how we could make sure that what is going on is being implemented for the benefit of our constituents, maybe some things that need to be clarified or at least one example of what we can help you do better.    Mr. Cardenas. So we're not--just so the people watching on SPAN are clear, you're not talking about trying things that puts the patient at risk--you're just talking about administrative aspects of how to be more efficient and do a better job?    Mr. Cardenas. In the interest of time, I would love to hear more dialogue but my time is winding down. But how many of you have had the opportunity to personally get to know how health care is delivered in another country? So if you have, please say yes. If you haven't--it's not a criticism. I'm just curious because a lot of Americans think that we're embarking on models and practices that nobody in the world has ever done and I don't think that's true.    Heaven forbid we would admire another country for what they do. We wouldn't do that as Americans but have any of you actually been to another country in the healthcare space and got to see what they do? Yes or no.    Mr. Cardenas. Yes? One? So two yes, two no. Well, in the interest of time, a million more questions but not enough time. But thank you so much, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor. Thank you.
