    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Madam Chair.    All of this hearing isn't focused on research. I know that Mr. Wood had addressed research as a component for growth in this region, in this area.    As you know, the government plays an important role in supporting cutting-edge research on all aspects of cybersecurity from prevention to detection to recovery. And through agencies such as the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Homeland Security, we fund everything from basic research to testbeds for emerging technologies. And all these federal investments in cybersecurity R&D are coordinated under the longstanding networking and information technology R&D programs.    So while Mr. Wood did raise the issue of research, are there recommendations that you, Mr. Wood, or any of our individuals who are testifying, any recommendations that you would have about federal agencies and how to set research priorities and what major research gaps might exist out there so that we can better partner in a more effective manner with research opportunity? Mr. Wood?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you.    Anyone else? Mr. Schneider.    Mr. Tonko. Thank you.    Mr. Clinton?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, and Dr. Casado, please?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you very much, and with that, I yield back, Madam Chair.    Chairwoman Comstock. Thank you, and I now recognize Mr. LaHood.
