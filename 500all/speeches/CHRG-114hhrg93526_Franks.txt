    Mr. Franks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, it is often said that when human rights and human laws are in human hands that men lose their freedom.    Professor Foley, I sometimes am entertained by reading from the Federalist Papers to law professors like yourself. I am not an attorney, so it just gives me a little thrill, you understand?    But in Madison statements in Federalist No. 47, he stated that, ``The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.''    The Framers of the Constitution understood that the accumulation of powers and tyranny were inseparable. They rejected giving the newly created Chief Executive the legal authority to suspend or dispense with the enforcement of the laws. That, of course, in their minds, was the province of Congress.    So my question to you is, do you believe that the President's recent actions comport with the Framers' conclusions? And is President Obama refusing to adhere to the ``take care'' clause in an attempt to evade the will of Congress? And was he acting constitutionally when he did that?    Mr. Franks. Well, I am not sure I should ask any more questions at that point.    But, Professor Blackman, do you agree with the comments, basically?    Mr. Franks. Professor Foley, let me just quickly expand on one other thing you mentioned. The Federal District Court in Texas made this distinction between the Federal Government simply not enforcing immigration laws on removal of an individual and taking the next step of actually providing lucrative benefits to unlawful aliens. That seems to be an incredibly stark precedent here. Could you expand on that a little bit?
