    Mrs. Lummis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    You may be wondering why a Member from Wyoming would come to a hearing that is mostly a coastal states' issue. I got to go to Fresno to a hearing on the Delta smelt, and I got to see the dried up almond trees, the dead pistachio trees. We got to meet the farmers who are out of work, both owners and workers who are desperately trying to hang on to a culture, a way of life, a community. And they came together to address these issues, and it was kind of moving. So, I continue to have an interest in this issue.    My question is for you, and I am going to need help with your name. Is it Murillo, Mr. Murillo?    Mrs. Lummis. OK. And I can address this also to your colleagues at the Department of the Interior. How do two different agencies who are overseeing endangered species act in contradiction to each other? We have Fish and Wildlife Service and NMFS, each in a tug-of-war. One wants more flow, the other wants less. They seem to be operating in a vacuum. Why shouldn't there be one biological opinion that covers both the smelt and the salmon?    Mrs. Lummis. Gentlemen--and I am sorry, I just walked in so I am a little behind the curve--could you also address that? NMFS and Fish and Wildlife are both represented here, correct?    Oh, great. Could you enlighten me?    Mrs. Lummis. And you can respond to this additional question. Is the court's decision binding upon you in perpetuity?    Mrs. Lummis. OK.    Mrs. Lummis. Yes.    Mrs. Lummis. Oh. So reclaiming my time, as I understand it, there has been a decline from 10,500 cfs to 8,000 cfs. Why?    Mrs. Lummis. Thank you.    I do want to double back to the gentleman from NMFS.    Mrs. Lummis. Thank you.    My time is about to expire, so I yield back.
