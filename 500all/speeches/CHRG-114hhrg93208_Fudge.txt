    Ms. Fudge. Thank you.    Ms. Fudge. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I thank all of you for being here today. Look forward to hearing your testimony.    I certainly want to recognize the ranking member of the full committee who has joined us, Representative Scott, from Virginia.    And I want to say to the chairman, indeed I do hope that we can have some very productive meetings and discussions. This is a very timely topic. I thank you for calling this hearing.    I do though find it unfortunate that it is our first hearing after we had a 10-hour mark up yesterday on ESEA. And with that, to you, more than ever before, technology does play an essential role in educating our nation's children, enhancing learning and empowering educators with more and better information to meet the individual needs of their students.    Gone are the days when education was supported by flashcards and workbooks. Today's students use electronic tablets and smartphone apps, online study tools, and various other technological resources to aid them in their studies. Teachers have the ability to extend learning beyond the classroom using online learning platforms to share multimedia resources and engage parents in their children's learning.    New educational technology generates information that can be instrumental in improving a student's learning experience. The data from these tools allow teachers to more accurately assess student progress and provide interventions to ensure children are learning.    Data can also assist schools in making district strategy and curriculum decisions. Many states now use longitudinal data systems to link student achievement data from pre-K through grade 12, or even through entrance into the workforce, enabling district and state leaders to make informed, data-driven policy decisions.    While the use of technology in education continues to expand, we must take the necessary steps to protect the privacy and the data of students and their families. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act was enacted 40 years ago to address concerns about privacy in a time of paper student records. Innovative new educational technology tools capture large amounts of student data. And many districts now contract with private vendors to use online, cloud-based storage for students. I see some of those very vendors here today.    Congress must ensure student data is being used only for defined educational purposes and cannot be sold or used for private companies' financial gain. Parents should know who has access to student data and how it is being used and protected. And teachers and school leaders need to understand how to properly protect student information while taking advantage of the powerful digital learning tools at their disposal.    As we examine FERPA, we need to balance privacy and innovation. Students, teachers, and parents need to feel comfortable that student data is protected. At the same time, we need to be careful not to limit the advancement of new educational technologies, restrain educators' ability to accurately assess student learning, or stifle research and development of effective instruction tools.    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.      Prepared Statement of Hon. Marcia L.

And again, thank you all for your testimony.    Let me start with you, Dr. Abshire. You have kind of been talking around it. But can you just give me some specifics about what you believe we can do or how FERPA can be modified to reflect the change in technological climate, while still ensuring that children's data is protected?    I mean, I understand, you know, that you don't want us to put more onerous restrictions. And I understand that too. But my priority is children. And so if--you know, maybe it is a little much and we can work on it. But how can we protect these children? What do we need to do with FERPA?    Ms. Fudge. I don't want to cut you off, but I have got some other questions I must ask, so--    Ms. Fudge. So parental consent. Ms. Knox, what has Microsoft actually done to protect the data?    Ms. Fudge. Thank you very much.    Dr. Abshire, can you give me an example of how your district uses this data dashboard to effect curriculum decisions and to provide interventions for struggling students?    Ms. Fudge. Thank you very much, thank you very, very much.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Fudge. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    And again, I thank all of you for being here. Very insightful. Very educational. We have learned a great deal today, and certainly will take parts of the discussion to try to determine how we best can serve students, as well as to make sure that their educational experiences are what they can be in this age of technology. Thank you all. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.
