    Ms. Haske. It is Haske.    Ms. Haske, you are recognized for 5 minutes.    Ms. Haske. I would like to decline at this time. I am too scared.    Ms. Haske. I am Jacqueline Haske, the Chippewa County Veterans Affairs Officer. Mine is piggybacking on everybody else.    My main concern is having a doctor in the community. One of the issues we have is if a veteran comes to the community as a new veteran, they are unable to be seen by a doctor if they have the Choice Card because several of the doctors are not receiving new patients at this time. So our concern is not just because of the need for a doctor in the area, but the doctors with the Choice Card are refusing, and that is all.    Ms. Haske. No, sir.    Ms. Haske. With the records?    Ms. Haske. Yes.
