    Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank my colleague, Ms. Lofgren, for letting me go in front of her.    Mr. Conyers. I'll yield.    Mr. Conyers. You're more than welcome. I ask unanimous consent to put my opening statement in the record, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Conyers. We find that there's a problem that our immigration judges face, when it comes to immigrants. We sometimes confuse judicial discretion with judicial abuse. And I think you're very sensitive to that, Director Osuna.    Too much of our proposals, legislatively, have sought to streamline the immigration court removal process by taking discretion out of the hands of the immigration court. And so some believe that many forms of relief granted to immigrants are without merit, and I'm not sure if that's the case.    Do you have a view on that, sir, that you could relate to us?    Mr. Conyers. Thank you. I tend to agree with you. I realize that this is a thankless task to ensure that immigrants in removal proceedings have a full and fair hearing before an impartial immigration judge. And, so it's in that spirit that I come to these hearings. And, you know, the delay in hiring immigration judges is often cited as a reason for the immigration court backlog.    What are other challenges that you might give us this morning in reference to the hiring of immigration judges?    Mr. Conyers. In your testimony, you include a chart on immigration judge hiring. And in the second quarter of 2015 where you did not hire any immigration judges, can you explain why EOIR did not hire during that period?    Mr. Conyers. Thank you, sir. And I thank the Chairman.
