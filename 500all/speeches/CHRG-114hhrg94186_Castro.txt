    Mr. Castro. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you to each of the witnesses for your testimony and for your scholarship and your experiences on these issues.    Mr. Pomerantsev, you mentioned the development of conspiracy theories and particularly on the far right in Russia the development of those conspiracy theories.    I would ask you, do you see that spreading anywhere else? Is Russia the worst actor with respect to this or how do you see that developing in other nations?    Mr. Castro. So you are speaking of Europe generally?    Mr. Castro. Sure.    Mr. Castro. Sure.    Mr. Castro. Well, and I guess let me point out my colleague, Mr. Rohrabacher, mentioned--you know, made reference to liberalism in the United States.    But we have a few Presidential candidates running for President of the United States who have also cozied up to people who are conspiracy theorists and who themselves espouse conspiracy theories. Could you speak on that?    Mr. Castro. Well, and I guess my question is, and if any of you would like to comment on it, do you see--I mean, should we be worried about that in the United States or the Americas? Is it something that is particular to Russia and to Europe?    Mr. Castro. Sure.
