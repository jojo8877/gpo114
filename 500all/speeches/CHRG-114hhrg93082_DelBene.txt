    Ms. DelBene. An opportunity to----    Ms. DelBene. Thank you. First, Mr. Chair, I would ask unanimous consent to submit two letters for the record from victims and their families asking the majority for the ability to testify at this hearing and also in the last Congress.    Ms. DelBene. I wish they had the opportunity to represent themselves. In the interest of transparency, my first question is for you, Mr. Vari. You support transparency in terms of the victim, information on victims' exposure. And I wondered, do you also support transparency for asbestos corporations, the ones that you have represented, so that they can be more forthcoming with information about the name and location of asbestos-contained products, work sites, and exposures? Would you support congressional legislation to do that?    Ms. DelBene. But this could be publicly-available information, which could be important for others to be aware of as well in the interest of transparency.    Ms. DelBene. It seems like there is an inconsistency between the depth of information you would require from victims and the information required from corporations. That is disappointing that we talk about transparency, but we are not willing in legislation to look at this in an equal-sided way.    Mr. Inselbuch, I wanted to ask, you talk about some of the State legislation that has also happened in the interest of transparency in Ohio, and Oklahoma, and other areas. I wondered if you could respond to some of the issues on transparency and also what you have seen from the impact of State legislation so far.    Ms. DelBene. Thank you. I know my time is going to expire, so I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
