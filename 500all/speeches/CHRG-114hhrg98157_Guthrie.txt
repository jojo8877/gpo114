    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for being here. And my first question is for Commissioner Pai, and it is three parts. I will ask, and if you need it repeated, I can do so as well, but this all flows together. But why do you oppose putting broadcasters in the duplex gap, and why is it important to minimize the number of broadcast stations placed in the wireless portion of the 600 megahertz band after the incentive auction? And I can stop there. I will go ahead and give you the three, and see--maybe you can answer one. Why do you believe it is preferable to put broadcast stations in the uplink portion--or the wireless band, rather than the downlink? And you have suggested that the Commission hold an en banc hearing to discuss issues related to the 600 megahertz plan. Why do you such a hearing would be helpful?    Mr. Guthrie. OK. I am going to try to get another question in, and for Commissioner Pai as well. So you said hopefully this is the last spectrum auction for a long time, I think you said?    Mr. Guthrie. Well, do you believe enough is being done to ensure there is a long term national strategy to make additional spectrum available for commercial use, and if not, what else do you believe should be done?    Mr. Guthrie. Do you think congressional action is needed?    Mr. Guthrie. Chairman Wheeler, I only have about 20 some seconds, but to comment on what he was about, the national--more available spectrum?    Mr. Guthrie. May not be enough time.    Mr. Guthrie. OK. I only have 9 seconds, so I yield back, sorry.
