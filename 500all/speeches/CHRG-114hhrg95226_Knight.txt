    Mr. Knight. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    I would go on a line of questioning of kind of what we've done in California. I think that my statement would be that California has probably gone about this as stringent as any state in the union as far as our clean air, clean water, clean energy, clean everything that we have done, not just of course on EPA standards because everyone has to go along with that but what the legislature has done in California to go about this.    So I guess my questions would be, and we can start with Mr. Kerr, that we have seen a loss in the last ten years of about 80,000 manufacturing jobs in California due in part to what we have done in California, not just by our regulations but what we have mandated on business and how they can interact with the air and the water in California. Do you think that--and I think Mr. Rohrabacher was going down the right line of questioning. Do you think we have hit a line in the road where if we go too far, then we're not going to just continue to hemorrhage jobs but America and many parts of America will be so uncompetitive that businesses' only choice will be to look elsewhere.    Mr. Knight. Thank you very much.    Mr. Knight. Absolutely, Dr. Paulson, and I agree. I just think that we possibly--and I wouldn't say ``possibly.'' I would say we have achieved a level that is very healthy in this country, and going further, we will be hurting this country and its ability to economically be a factor.    And I will say what we have done in California has worked very well. We have six of the dirtiest ten cities in this country.    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
