    Mr. Allen. Okay. Well, thank you, Chief, for coming and appearing before the Subcommittee today.    My former role in life was in the construction industry, and we did use a lot of laminated timber for large spans in gymnasiums and other facilities, which created these facilities. And so I look forward to continuing working with you and our industry on those types of applications.    In my home State of Georgia, we have over 24 million acres in private forest, which I am told is the most of any state in the nation.    I meet, and since I have been in Congress now for a little over 4 months, and we have met with a number of our timber folks. They have questioned--the first thing I should say is you have talked about funding today, but they have questioned the U.S. Forest Service management practices, which a lot of those management practices deal with preventing the outbreak of a fire. Are we where we need to be with the extent of management practices in the Forest Service to prevent these fires?    Mr. Allen. All right. Do you consult with the private industry as far as the techniques that we are using to prevent these fires because, again fire is a problem for our private industry folks as well?    Mr. Allen. Okay.    Mr. Tidwell.--because without the industry, we----    Mr. Allen. That is good.    Mr. Tidwell.--we couldn't do the work----    Mr. Allen. Good.    Mr. Tidwell.--that needs to be done.    Mr. Allen. The other thing we have going on in our district, which is near the Port of Savannah, is the new wood pellet----    Mr. Allen. Well, I can help you with that sustainable question----
