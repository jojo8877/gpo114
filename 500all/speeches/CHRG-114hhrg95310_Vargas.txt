    Mr. Vargas. I, too, want to thank you, Madam Chair, for having this hearing.    I also want to thank the Chief. I sat on the San Diego City Council. We had responsibility for the city police there. I was also in the State Assembly and the State Senate. And I have to say, the professionalism here has been fantastic.    I, in particular, want to call out Sergeant Stephen Merle. We have had a couple issues with people that have mobility issues in my district that have come to the Capitol, and he has been fantastic. One lady in particular asked me if I would pass along her thanks to him. Again, his name is Sergeant Stephen Merle.    And, again, I thank you for this hearing. And, again, my experiences have been very, very positive, and I appreciate it again. Thank you.    The Chairman. Thank the gentleman.    Mr. Nugent from Florida.
