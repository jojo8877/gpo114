    Dr. Benishek. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you all for being here today. I am learning a lot. I guess I have a couple of basic questions here, and that is, what if we don't do anything, what is going to happen? Maybe, Mr. Kirpalani, you have some experience.    Dr. Benishek. Mr. Miller, what is going to happen to the bond markets, not only for Puerto Rico but around the country in general, if nothing happens here? What is the story with that?    Dr. Benishek. Thank you.    I don't know who can answer this question, but I have some of the same concerns that Dr. Fleming had. If we do this, how is this going to fix all these problems? How is this going to fix the immediate cash-flow difficulties?    Mr. Weiss, can you comment on that?    Dr. Benishek. Well, give me an example of that.    Dr. Benishek. I appreciate that answer. I have heard in previous hearings about the potential for privatizing much of the industry that is currently owned by the government. But, how is this board going to make that happen or facilitate something happening that they change the way they do business there?    Dr. Benishek. What kind of a timeline are we talking about for all this to happen? Say this bill passed tomorrow through the House and all that, what is the timeline you are talking about?    Dr. Benishek. You are wasting time here because my time is up now. I did not get an answer to my question.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Just tell him ``now.'' Just say ``now.''
