    Mr. Soule. Soule.    Mr. Soule. No, Mr. Chairman, not to my knowledge.    Mr. Soule. Sir, I can think of one.    Mr. Soule. Sir, I can think of one instance that I made a mistake. I reported it to my staff security officer. The document was destroyed.    Mr. Soule. Absolutely not.    Mr. Soule. If by universe, sir, you mean the importance of it, I certainly understand the importance of it, but I don't have personal knowledge of everything that is said to have been released.    Mr. Soule. My understanding is that every document that was referred to us--but I will want to talk more in closed session, sir--we had the opportunity to review, and I can give you the results of that in closed session.    Mr. Soule. Sir, I'd have to speculate. I do not know that, and I don't know that we do know that, but I could take that back.    Mr. Soule. Sir, I'll look. I don't know. A week. Is that acceptable?    Mr. Soule. Sir, like my NGA colleague, I believe it was last fall, but I don't have that information in front of me.    Mr. Soule. Yes, sir, it's correct.    Mr. Soule. Yes, sir, it would.    Mr. Soule. No, sir.    Mr. Soule. Generally, I agree, sir. It would depend on the facts.    Mr. Soule. If it was indeed classified and properly classified, it should be treated as classified.    Mr. Soule. Yes.    Mr. Soule. Generally, I would agree with you, sir, but I would have to understand the facts. But in the general premise, yes.
