    Ms. Chu. Mr. Thorne, you and other witnesses argue that the Supreme Court's decision in eBay vs. MercExchange, which made receiving an injunction more difficult in Federal court, had the effect of entities moving forward to the International Trade Commission. At the ITC, these entities could pursue an exclusion order with less vigorous tests. You also state that the ITC is an attractive forum for non-practicing entities because the ITC and district courts apply divergent joinder rules. Could you describe what effect this has on cases moving forward at the ITC?    Ms. Chu. Well, Mr. Stoll, you also state the eBay case may have made the ITC an attractive venue. I understand that in the last few years the ITC has taken steps to free--to try to weed out these frivolous claims. And can you describe how the ITC altered the licensing prong within the domestic industry test to address frivolous claims? And what effect did it have in the Federal circuit? And also, Ms. Okun, if you could respond to what was said.    Ms. Chu. Ms. Okun?    Ms. Chu. Mr. Thorne, what are your thoughts on these changes and the fact that the number of cases are going down?    Ms. Chu. Ms. Okun wants to respond. Could she?    Ms. Chu. Thank you. Thank you, I yield back.
