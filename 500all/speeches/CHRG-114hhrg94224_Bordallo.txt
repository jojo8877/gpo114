    Ms. Bordallo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Secretary Carter and General Dempsey, thank you for coming today.    Secretary Carter, it was a pleasure working with you in the past and I am glad to have you back. As I mentioned in the service chiefs and secretaries hearing yesterday, I appreciate your sharing the dangers of sequestration. It is a short-sighted policy that undermines our Nation's ability to project power, work with our friends and allies, and protect our citizens, and I hope that our Congress can show the courage to repeal this bill.    Now while our Nation faces challenges across the globe we have made strategic choices in developing a focus in the Asia-Pacific region. Mr. Secretary, it is my understanding that in many areas such as infrastructure, maintenance, when we take cuts today we end up paying far more in the future.    Can you talk about areas where we would likely see increased future cost, if sequestration cuts funding today?    And if you could, make your answers brief, please.    Ms. Bordallo. Thank you very much. Also I have another question for you. Can you comment on how, broadly speaking, the fiscal year 2016 budget supports the strategic rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region?    How important was removal of the restrictions on the government of Japan funds for the relocation of the Marines in last year's defense bill?    And also, are you looking to activate the Guam Oversight Committee, which I felt was a helpful Internet tool to the DOD?    And how is revision of the U.S.-Japan defense guidelines going and how important is that to our bilateral relationship with Japan?    Ms. Bordallo. Thank you very much, Secretary. My time is almost out so I don't have time for the third question.    So, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    The Chairman. Thank the gentlelady.    Mr. Forbes.
