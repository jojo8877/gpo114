    Mr. Benishek. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chief Tidwell, thanks for being here. I am going to have a couple of questions. The Northern Long-Eared Bat has been recently listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, so there is an interim management rule in place, with a comment period open until July. How is your agency working to provide information to those who work the forests to ensure that they have everything under control and everything they need to comply with the new listing?    Mr. Benishek. Right. Okay, well, good. I am glad to hear that because people are quite concerned in----    Mr. Benishek. When can this start happening do you think? Will it happen this year during this cutting season?    Mr. Benishek. Well, good luck with that. And I appreciate anything you do to keep me informed with how things are going with that----
