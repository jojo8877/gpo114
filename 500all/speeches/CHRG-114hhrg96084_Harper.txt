    Mr. Harper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to each of you for being here on a very important topic, and I, too, would like to say, Mr. Wilson, thank you for the inspiring story. And I am not one who wants to brag on my academic accomplishments, but I did graduate in the top 100 percent of my class. So I wanted to go ahead and throw that out. It was close, too, by the way.    Mr. Jarvis, you talked about the importance of having a flexible workforce available to adapt to emerging trends. Can you give me an example of what you mean when you say it is unnecessary and short-sighted to train someone in a single technology?    Mr. Harper. And if you do that, whether we call it cross-training or giving them the different options here, what does that do as far as the additional time needed for the training program?    Mr. Harper. Within that curriculum for the 5 years, OK.    Mr. Harper. Great. Thanks. I will yield back in the interest of time, Mr. Chairman.
