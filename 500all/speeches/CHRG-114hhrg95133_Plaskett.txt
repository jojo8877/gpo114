    Ms. Plaskett. Yes. Good morning. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Good morning, gentlemen. I first wanted to thank Mr. Thompson for his questions because that really goes to the heart of what I was really interested in is an overall notion about what is being done properly and not.    One of the questions I had for each one of you was if we were to in fact enforce the compliance measures that are already in the agreements, do you think we would be at a level playing field or do we need to go beyond those?    Ms. Plaskett. Mr. Thorn, would you agree with that?    Ms. Plaskett. Do our transparencies in the American market distort that as well because there are going to be transparencies that we have that the other countries don't?    Ms. Plaskett. They get to see our cards, right?    Ms. Plaskett. Okay. I had a second question which is a little more technical one. Dr. Hudson, in your foreign crop subsidy database, you point out that non-biotech soybean meal receives a 13 percent premium over normal soybean meal prices. Is that difference due to customer preference or legal uncertainty, both, or something completely different than either of those? And what effect does that have on planting and decision-making that farmers engage in?    Ms. Plaskett. Do you see that in any other crops other than soybean meal?    Ms. Plaskett. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. The gentlelady's time has expired. Mr. Newhouse, for 5 minutes.
