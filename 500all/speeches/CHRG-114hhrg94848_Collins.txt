    Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I will be as quick as I can to get the information really directed more at Dr. Fauci and Dr. Schuchat.    And I appreciate your issue of the jump on swine flu, the same thing we were worried about with the bird flu, that didn't happen. That is the good news of RNA viruses, they don't jump off to--but if they do, it can be devastating. So my question is really on the universal vaccine discussion. And I don't think it has been made clear here. We have DNA viruses and we have RNA viruses. And when we talked about the vaccine for HPV, the vaccine for herpes, smallpox, chickenpox, those are all DNA vaccines. And it is relatively straightforward to get a vaccine for a DNA-based virus. Then you have your RNA viruses; HIV, Ebola, West Nile, SARS, influenza. They mutate a lot, that is what they do, but they don't jump species much.    So my question is this: Since we are talking about an RNA virus, so you can't compare influenza with HPV, you can't compare influenza with herpes, and I don't think that was made clear, but now that we are talking about an RNA-based virus, I guess my question is this, because they mutate, drift so often, that is the insidious nature of RNA viruses, which is why the answer to a lot of the questions coming here is more because they do mutate, that is the basis of that virus. So how is it that since measles is an RNA virus, polio is an RNA virus, rubella is an RNA virus, and so is mumps, so you have mumps, measles, rubella, and polio on the one hand, RNA, and we have vaccines for them, what is the difference in the reason we don't have vaccines for things like influenza?    Mr. Collins. Rarely.    Mr. Collins. Yes, but much less----    Mr. Collins . Likely than a DNA virus.    Mr. Collins. Um-hum.    Mr. Collins. Right.    Mr. Collins. Right. Right.    Mr. Collins. Sure.    Mr. Collins. Sure.    Mr. Collins. So how did we end up with one for measles, polio, and why has it been so god-awful, if not impossible, to get one for HIV or influenza? Is there any----    Mr. Collins. Right.    Mr. Collins. Yes, but now, HIV, that is where the immune system doesn't even see the viral particles.    Mr. Collins. Now, that is different than influenza.    Mr. Collins. It doesn't react to it.    Mr. Collins. Right.    Mr. Collins. Right, but that is what is unique about HIV.    Mr. Collins. Sure.    Mr. Collins. So one real quick question for Dr. Schuchat. They use adjuvant-based vaccines in Europe. We don't do it here. The question on the monocrobial, if we did that with an adjuvant, we could extend that production, we could produce much less, extend it, because you were saying production is the big issue. If it was adjuvant-based, you wouldn't need as much. Should we be looking at that as a natural part of the monocrobial?    Mr. Collins. Right.    Mr. Collins. Right.    Mr. Collins. Yes. Thank you very much.    Yield back, Mr. Chairman.
