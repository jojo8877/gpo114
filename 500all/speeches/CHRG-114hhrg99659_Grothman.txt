    Mr. Grothman. I am glad we have established that the Federal Government is not a proactive, reactive body. It is something for us to always remember, no matter what bill moves around here. It is something to remember about the Federal Government.    But be that as it may, the first question I have for you guys, this is kind of a significant story here. Just out of curiosity, just to see how the Federal Government operates, has anybody lost their job over this or have there been any recriminations in that regard?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Next question, I don't care who answers it. As I understand, it took months for the State Department to root out the Russian hackers in their unclassified systems. Now, apparently the Chinese hackers are known for leaving behind time-delayed malware. Do we know for sure that these people are out of the system by now or could they still be poking around?    Mr. Grothman. Okay, so it could be, but you think probably out.    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Final question. Apparently there are rumors that people are now selling some of these files. Is this a threat or do we know if it is going on? And if it is going on, are we doing anything to counter that?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. I yield the remainder of my time.
