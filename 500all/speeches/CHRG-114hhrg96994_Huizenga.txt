    Mr. Huizenga. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And actually I will kind of continue on the line of questioning that my friend from California had. And I might add, while I might question your judgment on things on occasion, politically I would view you as a qualified investor. I would hope that reasonably educated people who can go do this would be able to go in and make these types of decisions.    So I am kind of curious about this--sort of this fiduciary issue that seemed to be the pursuit, and about compensation. And Mr. Gerber, when the little exchange was happening you had a very contemplative look on your face. I am curious if you were looking to try to respond to that or any of the others.    And then Mr. Quaadman, you had mentioned that from your perspective, quickly, at the end of I think it was Mr. Neugebauer's questioning about you believe that this could help operational companies. And I wanted to expand on that a little bit.    And then Mr. Arougheti, you had talked a little bit about adequate protection. So that is kind of that direction I would like to go.    And Mr. Gerber, I don't know if you care to lead off, if you had something to say about that fiduciary element?    Mr. Huizenga. I think it was like the time of compensation for someone who was giving advice, where that compensation would come from.    Mr. Huizenga. And the vast majority of your investments, right, the gentleman that actually are involved in the BDCs here, they do go into operational companies. Correct?    Mr. Huizenga. Okay. Any concerns, anybody, about whether there might be leveraged money allowed to be leveraged again in this if you were changing that ratio? That had been--someone had brought up to me that sometimes these investors into the BDCs are using leveraged money.    So my time has expired. But thank you.
