    Mr. Tonko. Okay. Thank you, Chair. And thank you to all of our witnesses for joining us today.    Kateri, it indeed is great to see you, and thank you for the awesome work the Alliance does on this issue. I'm proud to serve as an honorary member, as you indicated, of the Alliance's board, and I strongly believe that energy efficiency should be our fuel of choice.    I have to tell you, I shared with Chair Smith--he had asked me about that assignment. I said I was on the board with the Alliance prior to my days in Congress also as President and CEO of NYSERDA, New York State's Energy Research and Development Authority. So I'm proud of that assignment. I'm especially proud that New York's capital region has recognized that it is indeed necessary to innovate and make the transition to a more energy efficient world.    So my question to you, Ms. Callahan, in your assessment of the industry, it is your experience that regulation often will spur the private sector to innovate. Do you agree that private industry in America has proven time and time again that it has the ability to adapt and grow when new rules or policies are introduced? And specifically, how have you seen industry innovate as a result of energy efficiency standards?    Mr. Tonko. And also, Mr. Batkins' testimony argues that efficiency standards can have a negative impact on low-income consumers that may have to pay more initially for equipment that meets the standards, and then they may not keep those items long enough to reap the lifecycle cost benefits. How would you respond to those assertions? And is this a significant issue? And if so, what would you recommend to address it?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you very much. And with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
