    Mr. DANNY DAVIS OF ILLINOIS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank all of the witnesses for having been here.    Dr. Golden, I know that you have done some work in Illinois, and you were here when Ms. McCorkle testified. I think maybe her situation may have been a little bit different in Illinois. Could you comment on that and why it may have been.    Mr. DANNY DAVIS OF ILLINOIS. Thank you both very much. And by no stretch of imagination would I suggest that Illinois does not have problems and unmet needs. But I did want to point out this difference because of the fact that there was a strong advocacy effort on the part of citizens who made it happen, and I simply wanted to give them an accolade for that.    So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
