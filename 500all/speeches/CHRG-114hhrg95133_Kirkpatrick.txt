    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Thorn, I am intrigued with your statement on page 3 of your written testimony. When you talk about how China really has disregarded their agreement, you mentioned that they have increased rice subsidies by 100 percent since 2007. That is disturbing, and is it just because we are not paying attention or we don't have the resources to bring a case to the WTO? I would like to drill down a little bit more on why that has happened. We obviously know that it happened, but it seems like we are not doing anything about it.    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. I agree. That is my question, too.    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. And how long does it take to process such a complaint?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. What is your thought about some automatic consequences? So for instance, we know this data, and it seems like there is no consequence unless there is a case that is prosecuted. What is your thought about some immediate fines or sanctions or something that would be an immediate consequence once the information was found out?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Well, just looking at the increases that China has put in place makes me think that it may be just the cost of doing business. I do share Mr. Peterson's thought that we may need to just throw out the old and come up with something new and would welcome that conversation.    I have about 1 minute left. Dr. Hudson, I really was intrigued with your comment when you said that a lot of these countries use agriculture as a strategic asset. And we don't seem to do that. What would it look like if we did?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for indulging in my extension of time.    The Chairman. The gentlelady's time has expired. Mr. Gibbs, for 5 minutes.
