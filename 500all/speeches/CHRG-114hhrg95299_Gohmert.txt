    Mr. Gohmert. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations is meeting today to hear testimony concerning BLM's ongoing mismanagement of reclamation bonds for wind and solar energy projects on Federal land.    So this Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will come to order. Under Committee Rule 4(f), any oral opening statements at hearings are limited to the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member and the Vice Chair and a designee of the Ranking Member. This will allow us to hear from our witnesses sooner, and help Members keep to their schedules.    Our subcommittee is meeting to hear testimony on a GAO report documenting BLM's chronic mismanagement of wind and solar reclamation bonds. I do politely ask everyone in the hearing to please silence your cell phones and anything else that makes noise. This will allow minimum distractions for both our Members and our guests to ensure that we all gain as much from this as we can.    Since I am not a judge anymore and do not have a bailiff, I cannot have you carried out if you make noise--at least not immediately--but anyway, please be polite. I didn't even have to say anything to the bailiff, he just went and got them out. That was kind of nice.    Mr. Gohmert. I would ask unanimous consent that all of the Members' opening statements be made part of the hearing record if they are submitted to the Subcommittee clerk by 5:00 p.m. today.    Hearing no objection, so ordered.    I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. Reclamation bonds are used to return solar and wind energy rights-of-way to their pre-developed condition after authorization to use the land ends. BLM requires right-of-way holders to provide these bonds so the reclamation costs are covered in case the energy developer becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to pay for reclamation.    If BLM does not have an adequate bond, BLM may have to use taxpayer dollars to cover the costs. As of April 2014, BLM held over $100 million in reclamation bonds for solar and wind projects.    Unfortunately, GAO found that BLM is chronically mismanaging the wind and solar bond program. The computer databases BLM uses to track bonds are completely unreliable and inconsistent with the project files. BLM has bond adequacy review policies that it does not follow, and 50 percent of the bonds are overdue for review.    In some cases, BLM holds bonds below the established minimum amount, in violation of current BLM policy. GAO estimates that about 30 percent of BLM's wind and solar rights-of-way are underbonded by a total of about $15 million. Out of the 33 wind rights-of-way that BLM has granted, over 60 percent have little or no documentation to support the bond amount. The remaining 40 percent have inconsistent documentation that varied widely.    These are not new problems. In 2012, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of the Interior evaluated BLM's Renewable Energy Program and found many of the same issues; but instead of taking corrective action, BLM charged ahead.    In fact, in 2013 President Obama proposed to increase renewable energy projects and set an even higher goal for energy generation on Federal land. The Administration's push toward more renewable energy was bolstered by millions of dollars in tax credits and loan guarantees for renewable energy developers.    It is still unclear whether these problems were merely a symptom of an agency that was in over its head or if these breaks on bonding requirements were part of an effort by the Administration to coddle a preferred industry.    The OIG described this rapid expansion of renewables as a boom environment and recognized that the volatility of the renewable energy industry makes reclamation bonds imperative. Instead of heeding this advice, we are here 3 years later to hold BLM accountable for the many problems that both the OIG and now the GAO have documented.    We would like to commend the GAO for doing an extraordinarily thorough, well-documented, and comprehensible review. Some issues, by their nature, tend to catch more attention than others. In this case, that would be particularly true regarding BLM's inability to demonstrate that it has adequately safeguarded bonds entrusted to it.    This, however, is emblematic of the broader problems documented by GAO regarding a program at the Interior that has woefully been mismanaged for some time.    Recognizing and correcting these problems, this time in earnest, is particularly important given the emphasis on promoting renewable energy projects on Federal land. Hopefully we can start down that path today.    Mr. Gohmert. At this time I would like to recognize the Ranking Member for her opening statement. I recognize Mrs. Dingell for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you.    I appreciate the input, the observations, and the homework you did, Mrs. Dingell. You are always well prepared.    At this time we will now introduce our witnesses. First we have Ms. Anne-Marie Fennell, who is the Director of the Natural Resources and Environment Team at the U.S. Government Accountability Office. She is accompanied by Ms. Elizabeth Erdmann, who is the Assistant Director of the Natural Resources and Environment Team at the U.S. Government Accountability Office. We asked her to come since she had been participating directly.    Also we have Mr. Steven Ellis, who is the Deputy Director for Operations at the Bureau of Land Management.    I will remind our witnesses that, per Committee Rules, oral statements must be limited to 5 minutes. Your entire written statement will be admitted for the record. However, as you speak, when you get down to 1 minute, the yellow light will come on; and when the red light comes on, you will then need to cease your oral statement. So gauge that accordingly.    The entire panel will be allowed to testify before questioning begins, and the Chair at this time recognizes Ms. Fennell for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you, Ms. Fennell. I appreciate your testimony.    At this time I would recognize Mr. Ellis for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you, Mr. Ellis. I appreciate your testimony.    At this time we will begin questioning. First of all, Ms. Fennell, some of your recommendations are almost identical to recommendations by the Office of the Inspector General that had been done several years ago, and I wanted to follow up on some of those.    But I also appreciated the Ranking Member's comments.    I am recognized for 5 minutes. Sorry.    She made a comment that we had not had any losses as far as right-of-way damage at this point. Something that had concerned me--I had seen that out of 31 authorized wind rights-of-way, 21 have been reassigned or had their names changed. Two of those have gone through bankruptcy, and subsequently a reassignment. Eight of the 21 have gone through three or more name changes. Those are the kinds of things that cause concern, that perhaps we need to be prepared for in the event one of those bankruptcies in the future does not afford the land and environment being properly repaired back to where it was before they came in with the right-of-way.    Ms. Fennell, your team reviewed every single wind and solar right-of-way for which BLM held a bond as of April 15, 2014. Is that correct?    Mr. Gohmert. During the course of review, GAO conducted interviews with BLM staff, as I understand it, across the whole country. Is that right?    Mr. Gohmert. Do you know if it was someone with GAO who interviewed the realty specialist in the Rawlins Field Office that was responsible for managing the wind and solar bonds?    Mr. Gohmert. And it was her job to make sure that BLM had a bond for each wind and solar right-of-way that was managed by the Rawlins office, correct?    Mr. Gohmert. Did the realty specialist advise GAO during her review that she only found about 20 percent of the bond instruments in the project files?    Mr. Gohmert. And actually those should have been in the safe. Is that not correct?    Mr. Gohmert. Right. About the other 80 percent, did she comment on what happened to those?    Mr. Gohmert. Well, it appears that she had indicated that those were shredded. Is that not correct?    Mr. Gohmert. Yes. I have noted in an e-mail from De Shann Schinkel on March 20, 2015, just 2 or 3 months ago, that she did not know the value of all the bonds that were shredded. So even as recently as March, she was still indicating that those bonds were shredded, correct?    Mr. Gohmert. Right, and I had seen that e-mail following up. Did anybody inquire as to specifically why those bonds would have been shredded?    Mr. Gohmert. All right. So basically, in summary, we had 20 percent of the bonds that were in project files instead of being secured as required by policy, and then 80 percent were gone, apparently shredded, correct?    Mr. Gohmert. Mr. Ellis, I did want to ask you about your June 3, 2015 letter saying that all the bonds in the Rawlins office are currently accounted for. You did not elaborate or answer the questions that were submitted to you by Mr. Bishop and me, and I am curious why that ended up being glossed over.    Mr. Gohmert. My question before time expired was very specific as to why you glossed over this. I was not looking for an account of what you did, but why you glossed over the fact that those were missing.    Mr. Gohmert. All right. Well, we will have to pursue that in a second round then.    At this time I will recognize the Ranking Member, Mrs. Dingell, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you.    To be clear, my question was about the 80 percent that were not available previously, not currently, so to set the record straight there.    At this time the Chair recognizes Mrs. Radewagen for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. I thank the gentlelady.    At this time the Chair recognizes Mr. Huffman for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you    At this time I will yield to Mr. Labrador for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. You yield back or you yield?    Mr. Gohmert. Well, thank you.    I realize the gentleman had just come in, but that would allow me to follow up on a couple of matters. We may want to look into what we are characterizing as the give aways to coal companies. I know it surely appears to people that are mining coal in my district and friends from West Virginia that there really appears to be a war on coal and so many have been put out of business. We have so many coal miners that are in the country that are out of work, and they certainly were not aware of any give aways since their companies have been put out of business.    But we also may want to have a hearing on the gentleman's comment that clean renewables have never cost the taxpayers a dime. They are costing us a fortune every year, especially when you look back at Solyndra and some of those that we continue to prop up with taxpayer monies. Some industries, like coal and oil and gas, they're allowed to deduct the cost of doing business as any manufacturer is; yet in the renewables, we just give money away trying to get people into those businesses, but----    Mr. Gohmert. Well, let me get back to that.    As of this writing, we have not found evidence that bonds were shredded. Mr. Ellis, you said that. Did you look into that, as to whether or not they were shredded?    Mr. Gohmert. That was not my question. I was asking if you did. You are here testifying, and you said as of this writing we have not found evidence. Having investigated things as a prosecutor, I know you have to go to the source; and we have an e-mail as of March that again says that she did not know the value of the documents that were shredded.    Let me ask you this. It was mentioned that sometimes these are checks that are used instead of bonds. Do you know if those were checks that were taken from the safe or that were not accountable, or were they actually bonds that later were replaced?    Mr. Gohmert. I am not interested in who else is looking at it. I am interested in your department. One of the things that disturbs me to no end--I like people being held accountable when they cost the government tremendous amounts of money unnecessarily--we had someone with Interior that left out language back in the Clinton administration that has cost this country billions of dollars in revenue from offshore drilling. We kept trying to find somebody to be held accountable, and we were told by Interior, ``Well, we think maybe the person that did that is no longer with the government.''    She had gone to work for, as we understood it, an oil and gas company. Now, as I understand it, that person is back with the Obama administration.    We have to start holding people accountable that do not follow the rules and that create problems. The letter that Chairman Bishop and I sent asked you specific questions, or asked Director Kornze on what date were the bonds shredded. Who removed the bonds from the safe? Who destroyed the bonds? Are the individuals responsible for removing and destroying the bonds currently employed by BLM? Who had access to the safe? Why were the bonds removed from the safe? Were the entire contents of the safe removed at the time the bonds were removed? Were the entire contents of the safe destroyed at the time the bonds were destroyed? When did the Rawlins Field Office notify the state office that the bonds had been destroyed? How was notification provided?    It does not give me any comfort that you say the OIG is investigating. We were asking for answers from you, and the best we get in your letter is, ``As of this writing we have not found evidence that bonds were shredded;'' then you gloss over it as if there was never a problem in saying the bonds are appropriately documented and the assets are protected.    Once again, it is like Interior is trying to gloss over this whole issue where somebody took those bonds out of the safe, from what we understand; and something happened to them. Indications were--whether it is hearsay or not--the best thing we have understood so far is that they were shredded; and yet we do not have an account from you that you have actually looked into this serious matter.    Have you looked into these specific matters?    Mr. Gohmert. Well, you are not answering the question, clearly. His letter did not answer the question, but my time has expired.    I yield 5 minutes to Mr. Polis.    Mr. Gohmert. Well, let's go to Mr. Polis, and then we will come back. The problem is that we sent a specific letter to the Director of BLM; and they are dodging it saying, ``Hey, well, it looks like there is an OIG investigation now.''    So anyway, Mr. Polis, you are recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. I thank the gentleman.    We will start a second round.    Mr. Ellis, were you aware that at least 50 of the orphaned wells in Alaska were originally drilled years ago by the U.S. Navy, and it was the Navy that abandoned them?    Mr. Gohmert. OK, and this is a direct question. Were you aware or were any of the bonds that were in the Rawlins Field Office replaced?    Now, you said they are there. But were bonds in the Rawlins Field Office, any of them, actually replaced?    Mr. Gohmert. Unless you are deaf, you have heard another witness testify that 80 percent of the bonds were not available in the Rawlins Field Office. Twenty percent were in project files. Your letter says all of the bonds were accounted for. I am asking you whether you know whether some or all of the 80 percent that were originally missing, as testified to today, were replaced.    Mr. Gohmert. Have you heard the testimony today that 80 percent of the bonds were missing?    Mr. Gohmert. Have you investigated whether or not any were ever missing?    Mr. Gohmert. Did you ever see the letter that Chairman Bishop and I sent to Director Kornze?    Mr. Gohmert. So you ignored all of those questions that we were asking and you just simply asked, ``Are the bonds there now? ''    Mr. Gohmert. You just testified that you asked them if the bonds were there. Is that what you asked?    Mr. Gohmert. By the way, I did not swear you in--I think we are going to start swearing witnesses in--but even if you are not sworn in, it is a crime to testify untruthfully before a congressional committee.    Now, the question that I have been trying to get an answer to is, what happened to the 80 percent? And you are testifying to this committee, of your own knowledge, that there were no bonds ever shredded. Is that what you are testifying to?    Mr. Gohmert. You are willing to stand on that, that no bonds were ever shredded. You are willing to stand on that under penalty of testifying falsely?    Mr. Gohmert. Because a lawyer would advise you that if you do not know, you had better say, ``I do not know.'' But if you are saying they were not shredded based on the evidence that I had, then there is an obligation you have to make sure you have the proper evidence and not mislead this Congress.    So let me ask you again--are you testifying that no bonds were ever shredded?    Mr. Gohmert. I am asking you a direct question. Is it your testimony that no bonds were ever shredded?    Mr. Gohmert. You had better testify to what you know of your own personal knowledge. Are you testifying to this panel, to this committee that no bonds were ever shredded? Yes or no?    Mr. Gohmert. So your testimony is the bonds were not shredded. Is that right? Yes or no?    Mr. Gohmert. So why don't you say, ``I do not know'' ? That would be a safer answer than saying yes, you inquired and no bonds were shredded. Because if you say, ``I inquired and no bonds were shredded,'' I am telling you, Mr. Ellis, you are misleading this committee. I am asking you--do you want that on the record? Your testimony is that no bonds were shredded.    Mr. Gohmert. I am asking you if you stand by what you were told.    Mr. Gohmert. When a person asking the question----    Mr. Gohmert. Your point is invalid because a witness is required to answer the question.    The gentleman is out of order.    Mr. Gohmert. Thank you.    If we are not allowed to get questions answered by witnesses, then these hearings are worthless.    Mr. Gohmert. He would not answer the question.    Mr. Gohmert. I am asking the question one final time. I realize we do not have a Department of Justice that has carried out any prosecutions so far, but some day we will; and I am asking you--are you standing by testimony that no bonds were shredded?    Mr. Gohmert. Well, that is not answering the question. You are saying that you did not do your job. You will let somebody else investigate.    Mr. Gohmert. And you believe that? That is your testimony. No bonds were shredded.    Mr. Gohmert. And you stand by that. You believe it.    Mr. Gohmert. Do you believe it or not?    Mr. Gohmert. I am just trying to get an answer. You provided that information to Congress. Do you believe no bonds were shredded?    Mr. Gohmert. I am asking you: do you believe no bonds were shredded?    Mr. Gohmert. Do you believe no bonds were shredded?    Mr. Gohmert. Do you believe no bonds were shredded?    Mr. Gohmert. We are trying to get an answer to the question that the witness will not answer.    Do you believe it or not? You are the Assistant Director. Just answer the question.    Mr. Gohmert. There is an explanation. Credibility is always an issue. This gentleman made inquiry, and his testimony as to the credibility of the information he got is always going to be an issue, whether the OIG looks into it or not. If he did not believe the information he got, that is certainly important whether the OIG looks into it or not.    But, frankly, I am so tired of government officials hiding behind some other answer and not doing their jobs when laws and regulations are being violated. They put people in prison for violating them if you are not in the government, and yet nobody is held accountable in the government. I want that to stop, and that is why I kept pushing for an answer.    So, sir, do you believe that no bonds were shredded based on the credibility of the people that told you?    Mr. Gohmert. Were they replaced?    Mr. Gohmert. All right. My time has expired.    The gentlelady, Mrs. Dingell, is recognized for 5 minutes. And if they do not answer your questions, then you have however long it takes to get an answer.    Mr. Gohmert. The Chair recognizes Mrs. Radewagen for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. I thank the gentlelady.    At this time--I could not remember if you had had a second round or not. Mr. Huffman is recognized for 5 minutes----    Mr. Gohmert . Or however long it takes to get answers to your questions.    Mr. Gohmert. If the gentleman is accusing me of animus, I would ask that----    Mr. Gohmert. I would ask that the gentleman's words be taken down for accusing me of animus. That is an improper accusation under the House rules.    Mr. Gohmert. I did not accuse anybody of lying; and, no, you can make the allegation without animus. Animus violates the rules, and I would ask the gentleman's words be taken down.    Mr. Gohmert. The Chair recognizes Mr. Labrador for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. The gentleman yields back. At this time Mrs. Radewagen, you are recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Gohmert. The gentlelady yields back.    I just have a couple of quick questions for Ms. Fennell, and I am looking at page 30 of your report, not your testimony, Ms. Fennell. You had indicated specifically in the conclusions that BLM has no policies in place to ensure that wind and solar bond instruments are properly handled and stored.    Do you still stand by that statement in your report, Ms. Fennell?    Mr. Gohmert. And you indicated earlier that 20 percent of the bonds were in project files and not in a secure place. Eighty percent were not available.    Do you have an explanation as how there are bonds now that are representing those 80 percent that were missing?    Mr. Gohmert. So, I take it your opinion is they were probably replaced?    Mr. Gohmert. So you do not know whether they were replaced or found, and obviously Mr. Ellis does not know either. You do not know of your own volition, your own knowledge?    Mr. Gohmert. All right. Thank you.    Do you care for any follow-up?    Mr. Gohmert. All right. At this time we appreciate all of the participants in the hearing today. If anyone wishes to ask additional questions in writing, they have up to 5 business days in which they can be included in the record. That would also include any other Members who wish to submit additional information. They will have up to 5 business days in which they can be submitted.    Members of the committee, thank you for your participation.    I need to introduce into the record a letter dated June 3, 2015, from Steven A. Ellis, Deputy Director of Operations, U.S. Department of the Interior to the Honorable Rob Bishop, Chairman. I also ask unanimous consent to include as part of the record, a letter to the Honorable Neil Kornze, Director of BLM from Chairman Bishop and me, dated May 1, 2015. Also, an e-mail of March 20, 2015, from De Shann Schinkel to Jessica Lewis, and below that is a November 3, 2014 e-mail from Jessica Lewis to Ms. Schinkel, so that there is no question about what they said. I ask unanimous consent that those be submitted as part of the record.    Hearing no objection, so ordered.    U.S. House of Representatives,                        Committee on Natural Resources,                                      Washington, DC 20515,                                                       May 1, 2015.Hon. Neil Kornze, Director,Bureau of Land Management,U.S. Department of the Interior,1849 C Street NW, Room 5665,Washington, D.C. 20240.    Dear Director Kornze:    The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (``Subcommittee'') recently learned that a number of reclamation bonds for renewable energy projects on federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management's (``BLM'') Rawlins Field Office were removed from a safe and shredded. The wrongful destruction of these bonds, which are intended to cover the removal costs of improvements and facilities, as well as re-vegetation, restoration, and soil stabilization of the project area, is deeply concerning and raises questions about gross mismanagement on the part of BLM.    In order for the Subcommittee to better understand the circumstances surrounding the destruction of these bonds, and the policies, procedures, and safeguards BLM has in place to ensure the safekeeping of sensitive financial instruments, the following information and documents are necessary and required to be furnished: (1)   Please answer the following questions regarding the destroyed             bonding instruments stored at the Rawlins Field Office:          a.  On what date were the bonds shredded?          b.  Who removed the bonds from the safe?          c.  Who destroyed the bonds?          d.   Are the individuals responsible for removing and         destroying the bonds currently employed by BLM?          e.  Who had access to the safe?          f.  Why were the bonds removed from the safe?          g.   Were the entire contents of the safe removed at the time         the bonds were removed?          h.   Were the entire contents of the safe destroyed at the         time the bonds were destroyed?          i.   When did the Rawlins Field Office notify the State         Office that the bonds had been destroyed? How was notification         provided? Who provided the notification?          j.   When was the Washington, D.C. BLM Office, the Department         of the Interior, the Department of Justice, or any other         federal agency notified that the bonds had been destroyed? How         was notification provided? Who provided the notification?          k.   At the time the bonds were removed and destroyed, were         valuables or cash kept in the Rawlins Field Office safe? What         is the total actual or estimated value of any such valuables or         cash that were maintained in the safe? (2)   Please describe how BLM determined which bonds were kept in the             safe and which were not. (3)  Please describe how BLM identified which bonds were destroyed. (4)   Please describe any policies in effect at the time the bonds             were destroyed governing access to the safe in the Rawlins             Field Office (e.g., who has the combination, what documents             are to be kept there, destruction of documents kept in the             safe, etc.) and provide copies of any such policies. (5)   Please describe any policies in effect at the time the bonds             were destroyed governing the proper receipt and storage of             bonds for renewable energy right-of-ways and provide copies             of any such policies. (6)  Please provide a list of the bonds that were destroyed,             including:          a.  The amount of the bond;          b.   The type of bond instrument (e.g., letter of credit,         surety bond, U.S. treasury securities, etc.);          c.  The right-of-way holder who provided the bond;          d.  The project or site covered by the bond; and          e.  The issuer of the bond, if applicable. (7)   Please confirm that a number of bonds kept in the Rawlins Field             Office were not secured in the safe and were not destroyed.             Please provide a list of any such bonds, including:          a.  The amount of the bond;          b.   The type of bond instrument (e.g., letter of credit,         surety bond, U.S. treasury securities, etc.);          c.  The right-of-way holder who provided the bond;          d.  The project or site covered by the bond; and          e.  The issuer of the bond, if applicable. (8)   Please provide copies of the LR2000 and B&SS records for each             renewable energy bond kept by the Rawlins Field Office             since January 2012. (9)   Please confirm the current bonding status for each right-of-way             for which a bond was destroyed, and describe any steps BLM             has taken to replace the bonds.(10)   Please confirm that BLM halted operations on sites for which the             applicable bond was destroyed, until such time as BLM             obtained a replacement bond.(11)   Please provide all emails and communications between the Rawlins             Field Office, the Wyoming State Office, and the Washington,             D.C. BLM Office concerning the destruction of the bond             instruments. For all individuals involved in such             communications, please identify their titles and contact             information.(12)   Please provide all emails between BLM and the Department of the             Interior or its bureaus, the Department of Justice, or             other federal agencies concerning the destruction of the             bond instruments. For all individuals involved in such             communications, please identify their titles and contact             information.(13)   Please provide all emails and communications concerning the             destruction of the bonds between BLM officials or staff and             the right-of-way holders whose bonds were shredded.

Rob Bishop, Chairman,Committee on Natural Resources,Washington, DC 20515.    Dear Chairman Bishop:    Thank you for your letter dated May 1, 2015, to Director Neil Kornze regarding reclamation bonds for renewable energy projects in the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Rawlins Field Office (RFO) in Wyoming. Director Kornze asked that I respond to you on his behalf.    You stated that the Committee's belief is ``that a number of reclamation bonds for renewable energy projects on Federal lands managed by were removed from a safe and shredded.'' The BLM takes seriously its responsibility as steward of America's public lands and is committed to sustaining the health, diversity, and productivity of those lands. Adequate bonding to ensure full reclamation of projects on Federal lands is important to the BLM fulfilling its mission. A preliminary review of the bonds for the renewable energy projects within the RFO indicates that all bonds are appropriately documented and that Federal assets are fully protected. As of this writing, we have not found evidence that bonds were shredded. We understand that the Inspector General is conducting an inquiry into this matter and we stand ready to cooperate fully with those efforts.    As a general matter, the BLM authorizes renewable energy projects on public lands under its management using a right-of-way grant under Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The BLM requires project developers to submit bonds to the agency to cover the potential cost of reclamation should the developer be unable or unwilling to conduct those activities itself. A bond is released when reclamation is satisfactorily completed, or when a project is cancelled or discontinued after preliminary survey work and reclamation is not required.    For the RFO, the BLM has processed 18 renewable energy projects that required bonds, with some of those projects requiring more than one bond to cover different aspects of the development. As a result, the RFO entered into 21 bond agreements worth a total of $170,000. The BLM has confirmed that the documentation for all 21 bonds is currently in compliance with BLM policy for holding bond instruments.    The BLM is committed to ensuring appropriate bonding for all energy development on public lands. In fact, the BLM recently worked with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to identify areas of improvement in the processing and recordkeeping of wind and solar project bonds. The BLM has issued a proposed rule that would, among other things, standardize bonding requirements for solar and wind projects. The BLM intends to proceed to a final rule in the coming months and will implement process improvements consistent with the GAO's recommendations.    In addition to the renewable energy arena, the BLM is also working to ensure appropriate bonding of other types of development on public lands. In response to a GAO report on oil and gas projects, and as part of a broader conversation about oil and gas reform, the BLM has solicited public input on bonding for oil and gas projects on public lands. The BLM looks forward to working with Congress as we continue to address that important aspect of bonding on public lands.    We appreciate your interest in this matter. If you or your staff has additional questions, please feel free to contact me. A similar letter is being sent to Representative Louie Gohmert, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, who cosigned your letter.            Sincerely,                                           Steven A.
