    Mr. Sires. Thank you, Chairlady.    You know, I am from New Jersey and we are a big pharmaceutical state, and I am very concerned about what goes on with the intellectual properties in this part of the world. It's not just stealing technological and intellectual properties but it is also some of the biggest research companies that we have in our state are constantly complaining that we don't seem to do enough about stopping the stealing of our intellectual properties.    And now we have a couple of treaties coming up. I just want you to reassure me so when I go back and speak to these pharmaceutical companies that we are doing everything in our power to prevent this.    I mean, so can you ease my pain here?    Mr. Sires. Thank you.    And I know North Korea keeps invading our computers and our systems here. I was just wondering, are we reacting back or are we just trying to put up walls so they can't do it?    I mean, there's got to be a price to be paid for what they're doing.    Mr. Sires. You sound like Donald Trump. Thank you. I don't have any more questions.    Mr. Sires. Yes, I'll yield to you.
