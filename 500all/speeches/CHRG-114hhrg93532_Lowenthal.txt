    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and also Ranking Member Engel, and Secretary Kerry.    First, I want to thank you for being here--I was going to say this morning--but this afternoon. And I want to thank you personally for your recent appointment of Randy Berry as the Special Envoy for LGBT Rights in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. This is an important, I think, and critical step in protecting the human rights of LGBT individuals. Senator Markey and myself in both Houses had introduced legislation that would have the same goal, but you stepped forward before this legislation even moved forward. I just look forward to seeing you and also Special Envoy Berry this week.    But I have to--I want to ask some very specific questions--maybe you can just answer later on--about which I am very positive, about the giving of the $1 billion for Central America. And you talked about how in Central America--maybe you can answer these--I will state them--in writing, and I will submit them this writing--the real lack of educational opportunities, the violence, the lack of sufficient investment, and the corruption, have been part of the root causes that have allowed for the migration to the United States.    My question is, how will this new policy that we are doing really reduce poverty, corruption, and enhance security? How is it different from what we have done before? Are we going to look at some very specific purposes? We hear all along throughout the world that we are going to reduce corruption. I would really like to know how you see what we are doing as really aiding in this. And also, in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, are they going to raise the revenue to help to do this? Are they going to introduce and actually collect additional revenues or taxes to really help themselves also? Or what does this mean in terms of our ongoing relationship with----    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you. I look forward to your response.
