    Mr. Weber. Thank you. My opening statement is that I submit my opening statement for the record. Welcome.    Mr. Weber. Thank you.    Mr. Lordan, a friend of mine likes to say that nothing is faster than the speed of light, and if you don't believe that, try opening the refrigerator door before the light comes on.    An NNEMP, a nonnuclear electromagnetic pulse device, now you talked about the sun flare. I was astounded by that and did a little math. The sun is 93 million miles from Earth or 94.5 at its aphelion. So at 186,000 miles an hour, how long do you anticipate it would take an event like the solar flare to hit us?    Mr. Weber. Okay. And my study, I know that the NNEMP, nuclear electromagnetic pulse weapons, there's a lot of discussion. There's nonnuclear electromagnetic pulse weapons, and they talk about capacitor banks.    Mr. Weber. So I owned an air-conditioning company for 34 years and we're used to a lot of power, you know, calculations on a house being built, the size of a wire and all that kind of stuff needed, so I pay close attention to it. And of course being from Texas we have the ERCOT, Electric Reliability Council of Texas. We have our own grid, about 85 percent of the State. So we pay real close attention to that.    But from the nonnuclear weapon standpoint, the capacitor banks that could go on the end of a missile, are you familiar with those?    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. Right, and we're going to discuss that grid. I think it was Dr. Morgan who might have said you wouldn't want to put high-voltage underground. And one way to harden the grid would be to have most of your utilities underground. But when you say small, back to the NNEMPs, define small, 4 feet, 6 feet, 2 feet.    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. Okay. So let's go on to what I think Dr. Morgan said. You wouldn't want to put high-voltage wire underneath the ground, and a lot of utilities in a lot of States require--a lot of subdivisions require that utilities come into the neighborhood now underground, whether it's--you know, of course obviously water, sewer, electricity, phone, that kind of stuff, as opposed to the aerial overhead. How high does voltage have to be before you think you wouldn't want to put it underground?    Mr. Weber. Sure.    Mr. Weber. So you're not talking about from an engineering perspective----    Mr. Weber. --just the dollar amount?    Mr. Weber. Right.    Mr. Weber. Now, let's define small. Is that three feet, two feet?    Mr. Weber. Okay, so a truck bomb?    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. Well, let's go there. You talked about--one of you talked about the snipers from 2002.    Mr. Weber. So transformer is a set of coils, and again we dealt with transformers, high-voltage, low-voltage in the air-conditioning business with oil in it, a light oil----    Mr. Weber. That's right. Why don't they just make the steel thicker and less----    Mr. Weber. Sure. Well----    Mr. Weber. You betcha.    Mr. Weber. And, Mr. Lordan, you wanted to weigh in.    Mr. Weber. You've got to have a way to get the heat out. Yeah.    Mr. Weber. Well, a really good sniper can take the insulators out and bring the wires off down in contact with metal structure so----    Mr. Weber. Oh, absolutely. You know, let a squirrel get across a couple of those things, it doesn't do the squirrel a lot of good and I've seen quite a number of transformers blown. Okay. Well, thank you. I yield.    Mr. Weber. We had that discussion in my office this morning with my staffer in this area because I said, look, you're going to want to have death and destruction that shows up on TV. You're going to put it in a football stadium, for example.    Mr. Weber. Yeah, good point. Thank you. I yield back.
