    Ms. Bascetta. We haven't done work specifically on that question, but we do know that for many years before the recent concerns about waiting times at the--at the VA, there were--there were limitations in their ability to take care of all of the veterans. So they've always had a capacity to send veterans out on the market for what they then call fee basis care. That was greatly expanded through the Choice program. We have very significant concerns not only in the civilian sector, but actually in--for all of us about coordination of care in those situations. It's one thing to have the most cost effective care available. That's critically important, but the quality of that care and the coordination to ensure that the care is actually value based is where we are really trying to drive care for everybody in----    Ms. Bascetta. We were concerned about the issue because when the prospective payment system was put in place many years ago, the cancer hospitals were designated as exempt because at the time the belief was that the payment system wouldn't adequately reflect their costs. It hasn't been revisited since then, and we believe now, based on an analysis that we did that compared the populations that were cared for in regular teaching hospitals that are paid under the prospective system and the PCH hospitals, that in fact there aren't differences in outcomes and that the care is comparable. So we believe based on that analysis that the savings to the--up to about $500 million.    Ms. Bascetta. Yes.    Ms. Bascetta. Absolutely.    Ms. Bascetta. It's $156 million on the inpatient side and about $303 million on the outpatient side.
