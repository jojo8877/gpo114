    Mrs. Radewagen. I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman and the Ranking Member. I, too, would like to welcome the panel. Thank you for appearing today.    Mr. Andrew, going all the way back to the 2010 GAO report on Border Patrol access to Federal land, the agents in charge of four separate stations reported that land management laws are impacting the security status of their jurisdiction. What have you done to work with these stations to ensure that environmental restrictions are not endangering the country?    Mrs. Radewagen. Ms. Chilton, in your conversations with Border Patrol, how do they explain leaving vast areas, such as your ranch, unprotected?    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Ms. Chilton. My time is short.    Commissioner Pinkerton, as someone with decades of experience in border security, particularly on Federal land, how do environmental restrictions hamper border security operations, and how has this problem become better or worse?    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.    Mrs. Radewagen. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
