    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I, too, want to thank the panel for joining us today. Thank you all. I know this is--you have been here awhile already.    For Mr. McGuire, Mr. Cosgriff, and Mr. Yurek, how important is early stakeholder input in the rulemaking process? I mean, what are the additional challenges that you face when DOE issues a notice of proposed rulemaking without having consulted with you beforehand?    Mr. McGuire, let's start with you.    Mr. Johnson. Before we go any further, I really want you guys to get the dishwasher rule right. I am the dishwasher at my house, and if the dishwashers don't clean, I have got a real problem. So I mean, it is going to be double work for me, so Mr. Cosgriff, go ahead.    Mr. Johnson. Got you. Thank you. Mr. Yurek.    Mr. Johnson. OK. Let's continue with you, Mr. Yurek. The DOE has proposed new standards for some of your products while the underlying test procedure is also changing. Why is this a problem for you?    Mr. Johnson. Is it safe to say it is pretty dadgum hard to innovate when you don't know what--how you are going to be measured at the end of the--end of this?    Mr. Johnson. You don't know where you are going, any road to get you there?    Mr. Johnson. OK. Mr. Chairman, I am going to yield back 45 seconds.
