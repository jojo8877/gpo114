    Mr. Moulton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    General Breedlove, I am interested in whether you think that we have essentially exhausted our means of supporting Ukraine with non-lethal aid at this point? And whether that, therefore, lethal aid is the next logical step?    General Breedlove. Congressman, no, I don't think we have exhausted the options in non-lethal aid, but I don't think that is directly tied to should lethal be the next step.    Mr. Moulton. I agree.    General Breedlove. I mean, there is much more that we can continue to do. But that doesn't preclude, then, should we also consider lethal.    Mr. Moulton. No, I agree with that point. I am just curious whether we have exhausted those options.    I am also interested in what both from the OSD perspective and from your perspective, would be other avenues of escalation. And I understand that some of this may be classified, but if you can speak to that for a minute, I would appreciate it.    General Breedlove. So, Congressman, thank you for that. There are other--as we just talked about a few minutes ago. We are focused on the military piece of the four pieces of--four types of power that a nation has. But diplomatic efforts can continue and we can step those up. Informational work--we are frankly well behind the Russians in this area. Their disinformation campaign is very impressive.    And then as you know, the debate about will there be further economic tools used. That continues to be talked about. So, I completely agree that we need to go back at Russia across all four elements of national power.    Mr. Moulton. Great. Ms. Wormuth, do you have anything to add to that?    Mr. Moulton. Okay, great.    Could you just take a minute to comment for a second on your view as to whether the New START was in our national security interests or not?    Mr. Moulton. Right. But could you just explain that a bit more? Because Mr. Turner raised the question that if the overall number of Russian weapons goes up and ours stays the same or goes down, it doesn't seem to the sort of casual observer that that would be a favorable agreement.    Mr. Moulton. Given that--given Mr. Putin's new ambitions in Europe, would you say that leaving tactical nuclear weapons out of that agreement is a greater concern now?    Mr. Moulton. I think 10 years ago, we didn't expect this kind of movement on behalf of Russia.    Mr. Moulton. Do you think that we should consider expanding our tactical nuclear arms?    Mr. Moulton. Thank you very much.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Important questions we will dig deeper into in the future.    Mr. Gibson.
