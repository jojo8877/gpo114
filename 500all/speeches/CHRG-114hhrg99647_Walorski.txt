    Mrs. Walorski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, gentlemen, for being here.    General Bunch, I have a question. What is your assessment of whether Boeing will meet its contractual obligations to deliver 18 KC-46As by August of 2017?    General Bunch. So, ma'am, we are still cautiously optimistic. Boeing still assesses that they can meet it. They are committed to that date. They have put additional resources to make that date, but we have no schedule margin. And if I am asked why I am cautiously optimistic, we are still early in a test program that we talked about.    We have been successful with meeting our milestone C criteria for an F-16, for the F-18, which was discussed, and also with the KC-46 receiving gas as a refueler. So we have made progress, but we still have a lot of progress to go, ma'am.    Mrs. Walorski. I appreciate it. And then, also, I represent Grissom Air Reserve in Indiana, where many of those KC-135s are still successfully flying, thanks to an incredible work of the airmen and airwomen there. So I appreciate your remarks earlier on how old some of these aircraft are.    I am concerned, though, about the program delays impact on the amount of time those aircraft will need to stay flying. Can you provide your outlook on the program more broadly?    General Bunch. On the KC-46 program, ma'am?    Mrs. Walorski. On the KC-135s and the KC-46 program.    General Bunch. For the KC-135s, ma'am, we do have investment money laid in. We are finishing up the Block 45 upgrade, which is to improve their maintainability and their reliability into more modernized cockpits. And we are counting on those being in the inventory for quite some time.    We have also done the FAA-mandated things, or will have that done by 2020 so that we meet that requirement and they will be able to continue to operate. So on the 135 front, we are continuing to take an older generation of aircraft, older than myself, and continue to keep it flying and viable through investment, smart engineering, and teamwork with all parties involved.    On the KC-46, we are a little behind on when we were going to do some of the initial fielding. We have delayed about 6 months. The first two bases that we were going to field the aircraft at, that has been delayed because the test program was delayed.    And we have not been able to get the spec verification reviewed and accomplished, and it corresponds to that. The aircraft are still being built, so they can continue to make the RAA date. And they are on track to do that, but until we can get enough of the test data and verify the performance, we can't accept those aircraft, and we can't put them out to the field.    So, the program is progressing. We have been delayed on the test program, and that is one we are watching very closely.    Mrs. Walorski. I appreciate it.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
