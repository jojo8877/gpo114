    Mr. McHenry. Well, happy anniversary. America has been saved. We are just living with the consequences of that savior, Dodd-Frank. And the consequences of that are lower growth, and impaired lending for community institutions and large institutions as well.    It means we have less job creation than we otherwise would have. And historically, Dodd-Frank is an anomaly in how Congress is legislated. And so, Dr. Calabria, I want to ask a little bit about this.    If you look at the last major crisis that my Democrat colleagues point to and say that this was an analogous situation we have lived through and that is the Great Depression. So out of the Great Depression, you have the Pecora Commission that reviewed the finite causes of what they were experiencing.    You had Congress in a bipartisan way--did they not write securities law, but the 1933 and 1934 Acts, right? These were not partisan endeavors as a result of that great crisis. Is there some context you could provide to that, Dr. Calabria?    Mr. McHenry. All right. Regarding--okay. I am reclaiming my time, Dr. Calabria. Although, you are rolling, I am sorry to interrupt. But I do want to get to a couple of other points, which is Dodd-Frank didn't eliminate risk in the financial system. It moved risk. The claim is that it mitigated risk, but there was movement into a different array of new risky institutions.    So financial market utilities, very important--even more important post-crisis than pre-crisis. And there is a grave concern that there is--there is a new group that will need a bailout going--in the event of another crisis. So in that regard, Dr. Calabria, not to interrupt your train of thought, but the concerns there that we have global clearinghouses that are so important here. What does that look like?    Mr. McHenry. I yield back.
