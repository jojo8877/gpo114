    Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, Dr. Moffit, as this Committee works to ensure continued solvency of Medicare, I think it is important to mention one of the most anti-competitive policies in Medicare. Under Obamacare, new physician-owned hospitals are banned from Medicare and Medicaid, and those grandfathered in are prohibited from expanding.    Despite critics' claims, studies have found that physician-owned hospitals do not decrease self-referrals and services . The truth is that hospital consolidations are driving up the cost. And that is happening without increased services or better care. Even the Federal Trade Commission has recognized the critical role private-owned hospitals play in promoting competition, reducing costs, and increasing quality. Yet this anti-competitive policy remains in place, and that is just wrong. Medicare beneficiaries deserve better.    Dr. Moffit, can you describe to the Committee the importance of competition for reducing healthcare costs and increasing quality, specifically within the hospital industry?    Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that. And my time is about gone. But Dr. Baicker, would you try to let us know later, what the system is doing as far as Obamacare is concerned? I am concerned that our cuts are phased in along with CMS, continuing to hinder plan innovation by over-regulation. And that result will be more and more of these plans leaving the market and forcing beneficiaries back into Fee-for-Service. If you agree--you are shaking your head yes.    So, I thank you, and I have run out of time. I yield back----
