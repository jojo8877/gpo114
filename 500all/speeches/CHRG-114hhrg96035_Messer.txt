    Mr. Messer. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for holding this very important hearing.    Thank you, to the witnesses, for being here as well.    I am the father of a 12 and 11-year-old daughters and an 8-year-old son, and so they are not quite to college yet, but certainly an issue that means a lot to me. And we have several different college campuses on my--in my district, as well.    You know, to reiterate what many of my colleagues have said, when parents send their children off to college they deserve to know that they should be safe. And frankly, if even one student doesn't feel that way or isn't that way, that is one too many.    I wanted to give Mr. Cohn just a quick chance to respond to the comments. Just let me ask this question this way, and what can--so, given your testimony, what can colleges and universities do to improve their disciplinary processes in an effort to be more fair?    Mr. Messer. Well, reclaiming my time, I mean, I think we all recognize that this is a serious, important crime, needs to be dealt with, needs to be dealt with in a way that practically works. And so kind of opening up to the broader panel, I wanted to talk just a second and get some counsel.    As Congress is working through these issues, of course we have to deal--we have to work through the intersection between the sort of local law enforcement issues and the campus-based disciplinary processes that are in place to deal with student discipline, as well, and I think that our legislation needs to recognize and accommodate those differences. So could we get maybe some testimony on how to work through that?    Mr. Messer. So invite Dr. Rue to also respond?    Mr. Messer. Thank you for your testimony.    Chairwoman Foxx. Thank you. Gentleman's time has expired.    Ms. Bonamici, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
