    Mr. Long. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Beck, you state in your testimony that the EPA wants the small coal waste plants to reduce mercury emissions, 70 percent of just 8 ounces.    How does this compare to large coal plants? Turn your mic on. Pull it real close there. People listen on the Internet and they can't hear unless you get your mic up close.    Mr. Long. Right. In your testimony you say EPA wants small coal waste plants to reduce the mercury emissions.    Mr. Long. So it is the same as the large coal?     Mr. Beck. Yes.    Mr. Long. There is no difference in the small coal plants?    Mr. Long. Are you in a position where you could discuss the financial impact of this rule on small coal waste plants?    Mr. Long. Can you pull your mic a little closer for me?    Mr. Long. Can you pull your microphone closer to you?    Mr. Long. What is the impact of this for the industry as a whole, then?    Mr. Long. Or go out of business maybe?    Mr. Long. OK. And Mr. Brisini, could you discuss the alternative compliance options and the SENSE Act for coal refuse facilities burning high sulfur coal?    Mr. Long. I am a little confused on my time. I have gone from 8--the chairman was very generous, gave me 8 minutes and 20 seconds for a while and it stopped and then a minute and now 38 seconds. I'm not sure----    Mr. Long. Well, with that I will yield back. I have been trying to watch the clock and fit in my questions but that didn't work too well. So I think the regulators have taken a hold of our clocks.
