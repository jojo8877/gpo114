    Mr. Barr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We will start with Mr. Ellis, and the question I have is, can you describe how the National Flood Insurance Program discourages private insurance, if at all?    Mr. Barr. Thank you. For those who are at risk, who are presently not mandated to have flood insurance, how do we do a better job encouraging those individuals to go ahead and get the coverage? Is it the all perils policy? Is it more capacity in reinsurance, inviting more reinsurance in there? What is the best way to do that?    Mr. Barr. The reason I ask is in flood-prone areas without the mandate to purchase flood insurance, I think the statistic is that only 1 percent of those structures are insured. So, developing that marketplace is very critical.    To Mr. Woods, though, my question to you all would be, is moving toward actuarially sound rates and risk-based pricing a real impediment to real estate transactions? And I would like to hear your thoughts on that.    Mr. Barr. We have seen, in my area in central and eastern Kentucky, real problems with the accuracy of the maps. And Mr. Woods, I couldn't agree with you more. We have to get to more accuracy in maps as part of that process of inviting more coverage. Can any of you all elaborate a little bit more on some of the issues that the members of your associations have had with these maps, and what are some of the ways that we can improve the mapping?    Mr. Barr. Sure, yes. Go ahead.    Mr. Barr. Mr. Ellis?    Mr. Barr. Yes, ma'am?    Mr. Barr. Thank you. I think my time has expired. Thank you for your testimony. I yield back.
