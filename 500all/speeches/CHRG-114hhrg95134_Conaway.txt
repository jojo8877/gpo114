    Mr. Conaway. Well I thank the Chairman. I appreciate that and yield back. I appreciate the birthday wish. Thank you.    The Chairman. I appreciate you sharing your birthday with the Subcommittee.    Mr. Conaway. Actually I am sharing it with a baseball team tonight. That is our secret weapon. To win the Congressional baseball game tonight is my birthday present to myself, and it will be a victory by the Republicans. I yield back.    The Chairman. I am pleased to recognize the full Agriculture Committee Ranking Member, Mr. Peterson, for an opening statement.
