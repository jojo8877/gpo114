    Mr. Swalwell. Thank you, Chair. And thank you to our panelists. Congratulations. I have to say it's refreshing to have a hearing about something so big, so exciting and further than the eye can see, and so, you know, in Washington it gets quite frustrating here. It feels like we are so focused on just very small, incremental things and people at home get quite frustrated that that seems to rule the day here. But the work that you're doing is so important, so big, and will inspire so many future scientists. So congratulations.    I had the opportunity to go with the Chairman and a few others to Antarctica. One of your colleagues, John Gunderson, joined us on a trip and he told us as we went through the McMurdo Dry Valleys, that that area--and he was excited to be on that trip and visit that area because it most closely resembled what we believe many of the parts of Mars to be. And so this discovery is another step forward in that effort.    As far as the water that has been discovered, do we believe it could support life? Is it too salty? Do we know enough about its properties to make that conclusion yet? Dr. Stofan?    Mr. Swalwell. Great. Any other thoughts from the panelists on that question?    Mr. Swalwell. And speaking of sterilizing, according to the New York Times, ``NASA has no plans to examine closely any of these places which may contain water or could be potentially habitable places out of fear of contaminating them with Earth's microbes.'' So sterilizing probes is expensive. Do you think it's time to reexamine this approach so we can follow up on this latest discovery?    Mr. Swalwell. Great. And finally, 38 million Californians are wondering: Can we get that water to California?    Mr. Swalwell. That's great. Thank you. I yield back. Thank you, Chairman.
