    Mr. Thompson. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, thank you for this hearing. I think it is very timely as we really get kind of an overview of some of the dynamics that are going on in terms of trade, especially when you prepare for a couple of trade agreements that have been a primary--consuming a lot of oxygen in our discussions right now and our thoughts, and I wanted to thank you both, gentlemen, for your testimony. As I read through your testimony and I heard your verbal testimony, compliance was an issue that came up. The compliance has been a discussion as we prepare for this next round of trade agreements. And it seemed like we have an opportunity to maybe put some measures in place, exercise the will of Congress within the trade promotional authority. Dr. Hudson, you had mentioned a very specific example in your written testimony of a lack of timely compliance when you talked about a key issue and specific analysis of subsidies that while notification of subsidy payments to WTO is required, requirements are rarely enforced. And you give an example where China just notified now its 2010 subsidy payment. So it is not real time, 5 year delay. The harm has already been imposed.    And so my question is more of a broader question looking forward as we have opportunities with the trade promotion authority or perhaps the customs bill that is out there as well. Do you have recommendations based on what we have learned and when it comes to compliance that we should be articulating as kind of ground rules? How do we get better enforcement of compliance? And what should we be asking for?    Mr. Thompson. I thank the gentleman, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back the balance of my time.    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. Ms. Plaskett, for 5 minutes?
