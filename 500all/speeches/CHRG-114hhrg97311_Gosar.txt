    Dr. Gosar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; and thank you for holding today's hearing.    Although Arizona is not known as being the fishing capital of the world----    Dr. Gosar . We do have world-class fisheries, thanks to hatcheries and cold water stored behind our dams. Arizona also has an excellent Department of Game and Fish to manage those fisheries and wildlife for current and future generations of sportsmen and women.    State and local expertise is paramount when it comes to understanding how management of our resources impacts those on the ground or in the water. Generally, these management entities are closer to those affected, understand the resources, and can make real-time, informed decisions better than a Federal desk jockey.    Today's legislation is based on the premise of state expertise and management. The fisheries managers in these five Gulf states have a firsthand understanding of the red snapper resource, and are asking to take over what is now a Federal responsibility. I generally support this concept, and voted for it earlier this year, as a way to move a resolution forward. But there are still some questions.    For example: why should Arizonans continue to pay for a management scheme that would be turned over to the states? In addition, 22 congressional districts line the Gulf Coast, but we need to ensure that the remaining 413 other congressional districts who rely on Gulf seafood availability are not negatively impacted by this bill.    These are just some of the questions that I hope are answered today and in the forthcoming weeks. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this well-intentioned proposal, and I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
