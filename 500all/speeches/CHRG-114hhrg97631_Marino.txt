    Mr. Marino. Good afternoon. The Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare recesses of the Committee at any time. I don't foresee any because that was the last vote for the day.    We welcome everyone to today's hearing on the State of Competition in the Pharmacy Benefits Manager and Pharmacy Marketplace. And I now recognize myself for my opening statement.    When a patient visits a doctor who recommends and prescribes medication, the patient rarely receives the prescription drug directly from the doctor. Instead, the patient submits his prescription to a pharmacy which then dispenses that ordered medicine. While this may appear to the patient as a relatively simple exchange, behind the scene exists a complex system. Within this system is a variety of different players who engage in millions of interactions that influence the types of drugs that are available and the prices that patients pay for them.    Two of the key players in this process are pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacies. Today's hearing will examine the state of competition in these two important markets. Pharmacy benefit managers or known as PBMs, play an important role in the healthcare system. PBMs oversee and administer the prescription drug benefits for more than 247 million Americans, or approximately 95 percent of Americans who receive drug benefits.    Through the management of these benefits, PBMs perform a number of varied services. They negotiate the prices of prescription drugs with manufacturers and wholesalers. PBMs design drug formularities that dictate the drugs that will be covered under a benefit plan and the cost-sharing portion the patient will bear for each drug. PBMs also negotiate with pharmacies to determine which pharmacies will participate in their networks, the fees that each pharmacy will receive for dispensing drugs, and the amount the pharmacy will be reimbursed for each drug.    By virtue of their central position in the administration of prescription drug benefits, some would argue that PBMs have the ability to place downward pressure on the prices of drugs. PBMs also can achieve efficiencies that result in savings both to the ultimate patient and the payer of health benefits. Pharmacies also play a critical role in the delivery of medicine to Americans. In addition to purchasing prescription drugs, they typically are the entities that directly engage with the patients. As someone who represents a district with many rural communities, I know firsthand how important pharmacies, particularly independent pharmacies, are to their customers. Many times these independent pharmacies develop meaningful relationships with their customers and provide essential assistance when dispensing the prescription drugs.    Together with doctors, pharmacies are part of an integral team that ensures patients are receiving the proper drugs in the correct amounts and administered in the appropriate fashion. I have been an ardent supporter of independent pharmacies throughout my time in Congress. In both the 112th and the 113th Congress, I introduced legislation that would grant independent pharmacies a specific exemption to the antitrust laws when negotiating contract terms for provisions of healthcare items or services. This would have potentially given the vast network of isolated independent pharmacies a stronger competitive footing relative to larger national pharmacies.    Whether this exemption is needed is another item to consider today. Many PBMs also provide pharmacy services, either through their own brick-and-mortar locations or through mail-order services. As a result, PBMs may negotiate services with competitors to their own pharmacies. Over the years, this has resulted in tensions between certain pharmacies and PBMs. The antitrust enforcement agencies have periodically reviewed PBM activities, finding in some instances that these activities are appropriate and stepping in when they are not.    Today's hearing with allow us to become better educated about the services that PBMs and pharmacies provide. The hearing also will allow us to review whether the proper economic incentives are in place to ensure that customers are receiving affordable prescription drugs and to explore some of the historic tensions between certain PBMs and pharmacies.    The public record generated today will also assist the Committee with its oversight authority of the antitrust enforcement agencies. We have before us Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, two of largest PBMs and pharmacy companies. They will provide an inside and first-hand perspective of PBM and pharmacy operations, as well as an invaluable viewpoint into the prescription and pharmacy industry at large. Additionally, we will hear from a representative of independent pharmacies and one of the experts covering both of these markets. I look forward to today's discussion from this excellent panel of witnesses.    The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, for his opening statement.    Mr. Marino. Without objection, so ordered.    Mr. Marino. The Chair now recognizes the full Judiciary Committee Ranking Member, Mr. Conyers of Michigan for his opening statement.    Mr. Marino.

I have people up here that nudge me. What I will politely and diplomatically do when we're getting close, when you hit that 5-minute mark, I will again diplomatically raise the gavel and try to get your attention and ask you by doing that to wrap up your statement if you would do that, please.    Ms. Bricker, would you like to make your statement, please.    Turn on the microphone, please. Thank you.    TESTIMONY OF AMY BRICKER, R.Ph., VICE PRESIDENT, RETAIL     Mr. Marino. Thank you.    Mr. Marino. Mr. Balto.    Mr. Marino. Thank you, sir.    Mr. Marino. Ms. Pons.    Mr. Marino. Thank you. Mr. Arthur.            TESTIMONY OF BRADLEY J. ARTHUR, R.Ph.,     Mr. Marino. Thank you.    Mr. Marino. The Chair now recognizes the Chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, Mr. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia for his opening statement.    Mr. Marino. We are going to go into our 5 minutes of questioning. And as is once in a while customary, I'm going to wait and ask my questions last today because I really want to hear what the panel has to say. And so I'm going to recognize the Chairman of the full Committee, Mr. Goodlatte for his 5 minutes of questioning.    Mr. Marino. The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member, Mr. Johnson.    Mr. Marino. The Chair recognizes Mr. Ratcliffe from Texas.    Mr. Marino. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes the Congressman from Rhode Island, Mr. Cicilline.    Mr. Marino. Without objection, so ordered.    Mr. Marino. Agreed.    Chair recognizes Mr. Collins from Georgia.    Mr. Marino. Without objection, so ordered.    Mr. Marino. They're admitted.    Mr. Marino. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Issa.    Mr. Marino. Go ahead, Mr. Arthur----    Mr. Marino. Thank you. I have about 30, 40 minutes of questions, but I know I'm limited to several minutes.    Mr. Balto, aren't we talking about--and I liked Mr. Issa's line of questioning concerning excess profits, but I'm a capitalist--are we really talking about excess profits or market shares?    Mr. Marino. Okay. Let's set aside antitrust issues for a moment though. But isn't it just customary usually those that have a larger share in the market generate more profits?    Mr. Marino. Okay. Let's move to--and I know what Mr. Arthur's answer is going to be on this. So I would like Mr. Athur to answer it, and then I ask Ms. Bricker and Ms. Pons to give me their opinion of this.    What is the downside of independents coming together and buying prescription drugs in bulk? What's the downside of that? You know, if there is an exemption to the antitrust law for pharmaceuticals, what is the downside of independents getting together and purchasing drugs?    Mr. Marino. Well, no, let's not talk about the antitrust part of it. That's another hurdle.    Mr. Marino. Ms. Bricker.    Mr. Marino. Ms. Pons, would you care----    Mr. Marino. Why the disparity then in pricing? Because of volume? Is there a disparity in pricing with independents with some entity representing them, negotiating prices with pharmaceuticals compared to your companies?    Mr. Marino. Well, we do know that independents pay significantly more across the board than examples of your companies. Why?    Mr. Marino. Mr. Arthur, I live in a rural area. We have independents and we have CVS and other pharmaceuticals--excuse me, pharmacies. What do you offer to your customers that you do not see the big chains offering, particularly if it's through the mail?    Mr. Marino. Again, this is for Ms. Pons and--excuse me, no, this is for Mr. Balto.    Mr. Balto, where do you see the transparency line concerning what companies, larger companies or any company for that matter, have to divulge? Who draws that line? Where is that line?    Mr. Marino. You aren't dodging my question though, are you?    Mr. Marino. Okay. I was a prosecutor so that's not going to work.    Mr. Marino. Okay. If I'm buying something from--somebody's selling antique cars and I buy antique cars. Why would I divulge? Why would I think of divulging what the person selling the antique car is going to sell it to me for compared to someone else who wants that same car?    Mr. Marino. Ms. Pons and Ms. Bricker, I don't think I gave you the opportunity, although you probably thought I passed you on it, on the issue of the downside of independents, collectively purchasing. Now, there was some discussion about they're able to join groups to do that. But the numbers don't seem to be indicating that there is fairness or a level playing field there.    Could you expand on your answers there a little bit, Ms. Pons. Do you know--do you get my question?    Mr. Marino. Ms. Bricker, I'm assuming you would agree with that, or do you want to add something to it?    Mr. Marino. Well, do you see--and I'll get back to you on that. Do you see independents eventually going out of business because of the volume that your companies are able to sell and able to keep the price lower than what a pharmacy can? Give me your opinion on what you see 5 years from now or 10 years from now for independent pharmacies.    Mr. Marino. Ms. Pons.    Mr. Marino. You know, I have a dog in this hunt, and I've experienced this several times. My daughter has cystic fibrosis so there are dozens of drugs that she takes. Sometimes the prices go up; sometimes the prices go down. But what I find very, very important is the one-to-one, face-to-face communication with a pharmacist.    And believe me, on more than one occasion, our pharmacist here and even when we were traveling in England where we ran into a problem, they were able to communicate. What can you offer that the--can you offer that same thing that--that same service that the independents offer?    Mr. Marino. I'm going to wrap up here quickly, but I just want to give each of you 15, 20 seconds to make--give a closing statement. So Mr. Balto, you had your hand up, please.    Mr. Marino. Ms. Bricker.    Mr. Marino. Ms. Pons.    Mr. Marino. You're welcome.    Mr. Arthur.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    Mr. Johnson and I were having a discussion really before the hearing began. And the two of us, most of the time we see eye to eye because we are looking for information. Right, Hank?    Mr. Marino. We're looking to be educated. And we in Congress, we don't have all the answers. You know, when we get elected we think we're taller, smarter, and better looking right away. But we look to you people, experts in your area, how to improve the quality of life for all Americans. And I think each of you have a role to plan that.    So my friend, Mr. Johnson and I, we're looking forward to hearing from you on how we can improve the quality of life for all Americans. So that is my request--our request of you. So please participate in this with us, send us information, give us your ideas so we can accomplish that.    And I want to thank everyone. This concludes today's hearing. Thanks to all the witnesses for attending.    Without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record.    Mr. Marino. The hearing is adjourned.
