    Mr. HARDY. I would like to thank you all for being here. I think it is an informative discussion we are having here. Mr. Ratzenberger, you hit right on what I have always believed. I grew up as a fifth generation son of farmer ranchers, and we could hold just about anything together with a baling wire and duct tape to make things keep moving. Through that process, I went to college for 1 year, and that year of college, the first thing that was taught to me by my aide was to make sure I get an academic education because the trades and everything are going out of style.    Mr. Perren, do you believe that is part of maybe the problem; that academia has pushed so hard to make everybody get a college education that they have looked down on the trades as being a viable opportunity to raise a family?    Mr. HARDY. One of the issues that has really been frustrating for me, I think Mr. Ratzenberger, you brought it up, but 35 years ago the schools changed. When I grew up, we had auto body. We had shop. We had welding. We had all these opportunities to do certain things. You can learn trades, but you also have to learn work ethic, and I believe you brought that up.    In our state of Nevada, we saw that shift almost 40 years ago, when I graduated, where these were leaving. Now, it is starting to come back but it is coming at a different level which is higher tech, but it has to do with the drones and building robotics. But these youth have to get involved. It is not part of academia. It is something they do on the side, and the trades are providing opportunity for these youth to come out and learn how to build something with their hands with fancy machines and everything else that is donated by society. Do we need to invest more in our high school education to prepare people for going into college, in your opinion?    Mr. HARDY. My time is expired. I just want to tell you, Mr. Tillman, thank you for lunch last night, or dinner last night. No, he did not buy me dinner.
