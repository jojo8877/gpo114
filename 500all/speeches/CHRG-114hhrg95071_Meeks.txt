    Mr. Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And I thank all of you for your testimony. I have been listening very attentively in my office to your testimony.    And let me just ask you first a few questions because my focus has been, on this committee, what we can do in Congress to make sure that we are not allowing the Internet and others to facilitate anti-money-laundering, et cetera.    Mr. Asher, I guess I will ask you the first question. I think that in your testimony, you mentioned that Congress should amend the Bank Secrecy Act to facilitate anti-money-laundering data-sharing among banks.    Now, the issue that we recently had the vote--there is a general concern among Americans about personal information being widely available to a range of institutions with little knowledge about how that information is being used.    So I was wondering if you could elaborate on this conflict and how Congress should proceed with improving the Bank Secrecy Act while also preserving the individual's human rights to privacy debate that we have going on in Congress right now.    Mr. Meeks. You know that debate is going on.    Mr. Meeks. I am running out of time. I would like to have this debate more and more. But, again, I am trying to figure out what we can do as a committee.    Let me jump to Mr. Barrett really quick because I think that you stated in your testimony that corruption, along with other forms of poor governance, particularly in the delivery of justice, is possibly the most significant driver of terrorism in the world today.    So I want to know--maybe you can elaborate on what role the Financial Services Committee, with our oversight authority of international monetary organizations, can play in better ensuring governance in nations struggling with terrorist organizations?    Mr. Meeks. Go ahead. Whomever--
