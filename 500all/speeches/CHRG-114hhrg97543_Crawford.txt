    Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador, Dr. Beckham, thank you for being here.    Ambassador--actually, this is probably a question for both of you. Well, I will start with you, Ambassador. In 2013, the EPA released some personally identifiable information of poultry and livestock producers, and specifically, they had geospatial business, individual data, that was released pursuant to a FOIA request by environmental groups. USDA and DHHS have expressed some concern that release of this type of information poses a biosecurity risk. I certainly would agree with that.    Do you agree that the aggregation and dissemination of detailed information on livestock facilities can pose a threat to bioterrorism, and what would you say to the EPA, and would you support proposals to caution them from that type of behavior in the future?    Mr. Crawford. Dr. Beckham?    Mr. Crawford. Dr. Beckham, there is a lot of attention, or at least the idea of the notion of failures of imagination when it comes to national security issues, I think that we can say that probably there was failure of imagination in regards to 9/11. Who would have ever thought that something like that would ever happen? So my thought is that if I can conjure up ideas to threaten our food supply, for example, to introduce Foot and Mouth Disease in a feedlot, surely others who have ideas of threatening our food supply, and thereby threatening our national security, have thought of this. Are we failing in failure of imagination, are we taking these things into consideration, what protocols are in place to address that? I am not a devious-type person, but I can come up with these ideas, so I know that folks that are seeking ways to harm us certainly have ideas like that. So I would like to hear from you, and then, Ambassador, your thoughts on that as well.
