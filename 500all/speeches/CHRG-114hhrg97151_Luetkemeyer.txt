    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    One of the things I want to talk about is the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC.) We are talking about, are we more stable as a result of Dodd-Frank?    FSOC was a creation of Dodd-Frank that was supposed to judge the stability of our economy and how we are doing. And one of the things that they were empowered to do was to identify different risks within the financial system, in particular banks and non-bank, non-financial institutions if they are systemically important.    At this point, FSOC has evaluated and designated three insurance companies and one finance company as systemically important, such that if it goes down, the entire economy goes down.    Dr. Calabria, would you like to comment on that? Is that possible?    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Yesterday, we had a hearing with regard to systemically important financial institutions that we are looking at, the mid-sized and regional banks. And it is interesting because there are a lot of folks in order to be able to--I have a bill to try and define that rather than have criteria for it versus a strict threshold. And it is interesting because they are trying to redefine what supposedly was in Dodd-Frank, which was to define those entities that would be able to bring down the entire system, and other trying to redefine it as something that would happen on a regional basis or whatever.    So, it really strikes to me at the heart of the ability of FSOC and other entities within this to be able to adequately point out risk. And I would ask along that line, we had Secretary Lew here a couple of weeks ago. He gave us the official report, the 2015 annual report of FSOC. And there are 11 different risks that he pointed out. They were important to be able to be aware of and watch and take very special note of.    And one of them that was noted that very same day that he presented this report to us was the CBO came out with a scathing report that talked about our debt. Could you believe that debt was not even listed as a risk to our economy? It strikes at the very heart of what I believe is the credibility of FSOC to be able to even analyze what is wrong with our economy.    Professor Zywicki, would you like to comment on that?    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Director Calabria?    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay.    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Along the lines of what I was talking about with regard to the credibility of the FSOC and some of the concerns with regard to debt, Dr. Calabria, in your testimony a while ago, you talked about the explicit and implicit guarantees and extreme amount of liabilities that our government has as a result of the Richmond Fed study. Would you elaborate just a bit on that very quickly--I have about 30 seconds left here--about how important it is to have all of this data and look at the big picture of what kind of risk in system and actual stability we have with regards to all that?    Mr. Luetkemeyer. I yield back.
