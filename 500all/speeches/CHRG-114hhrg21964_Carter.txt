    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank all of you for being here. We appreciate your presence today.    Mr. Sisk, how many employees run the GSA surplus firearms donation program?    Mr. Carter. I beg your pardon?    Mr. Carter. We have an agency in the Federal Government, and just one person that runs that program?    Mr. Carter. Wow.    Mr. Carter. I understand. I understand.    Ms. Ochoa, it's my understanding that the program records are kept in a paper file system. In fact, this system has been referred to as the backbone of the program. Is that correct? Is it kept in a paper file?    Mr. Carter. How would you describe the accessibility of this paper filing system?    Mr. Carter. Wow. In fact, in June of 2015, the IG's office reported--the report by the IG indicated that during their evaluation, they were unable to assess critical information, and this prevented the IG from completing all of the evaluation objectives that they had set forth. So, obviously, we've got some problems there.    Mr. Sisk, how many firearms has the program lost in the past 15 years?    Mr. Carter. 488?    Mr. Carter. Have been missing. How many have been recovered?    Mr. Carter. Seriously?    Mr. Carter. 488?    Mr. Carter. And you said 30 had been accounted for, and 29 had been lost, and 6 had been destroyed?    Mr. Carter. So how many are unaccountable--are unaccounted for? How many are unaccounted for?    Mr. Carter. Okay. Well, let me ask you something, how many does the surplus firearm donation program currently have?    Mr. Carter. 9,000 and some odd, is that what you said?    Mr. Carter. How many of them--how many of these have been distributed to law enforcement agencies?    Mr. Carter. Okay. But, I mean, they are in the custody right now of the law enforcement agencies?    Mr. Carter. All you have is the recordkeeping, right?    Mr. Carter. You know, Mr. Chairman, this is my problem here. This is my concern. I mean, here we have a Federal agency, a program that is totally dedicated to registering and controlling firearms, yet they don't even know how many they have. They don't know where they are. They don't know who has them. In some cases, they don't know what they are, and, yet, we have an administration that's trying to impede on our Second Amendment rights. It is true. It is true. I mean, here we have an agency that can't even account for it. Every responsible firearm owner knows where their guns are. They know what they have. They know where they are. And, yet, we have the government here who has no idea. This is appalling, Mr. Chairman, appalling. I mean, seriously. I just cannot believe this.    It's happening in--and, listen, I'm from the South. And let me tell you: we take our firearms seriously in the South. I mean, I can tell you right now how many I've got. I can tell you where they're at. And I can tell you exactly where they're at. And I know where they're at. This is--Mr. Chairman, I apologize, but I'm appalled at this. I'm just, I'm just taken aback by this.    Mr. Chairman, I will yield.
