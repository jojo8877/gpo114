    Ms. Tsongas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Weiss, for being here with us today. This is a complicated issue. I appreciate your insights and the deep thought that the Administration has given to the most productive way forward.    And just to sort of frame this in a slightly different path, I think what happens in Puerto Rico, as you have said, at the very least in sort of the out-migration that is taking place, will come and be part of our country. And my district is very reflective of that. One in five of my constituents identify as Hispanic or Latino, and 40 percent of them are from Puerto Rico. So many of them have friends and family who still live there, and they have seen firsthand the devastating effects that the 10-year recession and the debt crisis have had on the island. This is something that those of us who represent significant Puerto Rican populations have to take very seriously, what the most productive way forward is.    A lot of the debate is whether a voluntary agreement--or really, I think the crux of the debate is whether voluntary agreements alone are a sufficient way forward, versus whether you need to have a restructuring option at hand, as well.    And again, you have given some testimony to this effect. But, I would like your thoughts as to the many complexities of the voluntary path, and solely that path, without the restructuring option at hand. And I will give you some time to answer that.    Ms. Tsongas. What would be the impact on the citizens of Puerto Rico if--and the lengthy process of a solely voluntary way forward--what would be the impact on the citizens?    Ms. Tsongas. Thank you for your testimony, and I yield back.    The Chairman. Thank you.    Mr. Zinke.
