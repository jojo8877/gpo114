    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the panelists for being here.    Mr. Livingston, you know, we have been, of course, here today talking about failure at seemingly all levels in employee morale and training, et cetera, and the consistent terrible rankings that DHS has. What do you think it is going to take to instill a meaningful change in employee morale?    Mr. Walberg. Accountable leadership, go back to that. What does that mean?    Mr. Walberg. So the results that we are talking about today aren't a surprise to you?    Mr. Walberg. Mr. Brainard, we have heard of senior positions being filled with unqualified staff, untrained staff, specifically individuals with little or no management or security experience. Can you share your experience in this regard, specifically whether you know of any efforts on the agency to address this issue?    Mr. Walberg. Okay. Let me jump to another point here. Can you walk us through the process that TSA engages when they are evaluating a potential new hire?    Mr. Walberg. At any level, a new hire at management level specifically, but any other. What is the process that TSA walks through?    Mr. Walberg. Okay. Mr. Rhoades, complaints to leadership at the TSA going unacknowledged, ignored, et cetera. Have you ever heard justification for these complaints not being accepted or reviewed?    Mr. Walberg. What explanations have been given?    Mr. Walberg. None? None at all?    Mr. Walberg. So it just happens and allowed to happen?    Mr. Walberg. Okay. Okay.    Mr. Walberg. Thank you. I yield back.
