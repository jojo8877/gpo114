    Mr. Gibson. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the hearing, and thank you to the panelists, too, for being here today.    I believe that people have a right to know what it is that they are consuming, and I also feel very strongly about science and recognize the fact that we have avoided famine, because as was mentioned, we have modified over the years. So I recognize that as well.    I represent 11 counties in Upstate New York. I am a fervent and a strident advocate for my farmers. Ensuring the viability of our family farms is critical, a principle that we can't drop as we move forward reconciling right-to-know and science. And so I thank Ms. Lidback for being here today, and thank you for your testimony.    I also have tremendous faith in the American people that empowered with information--I guess I don't agree with some of the assessments that they would change their consumption habits. I think that they will make good choices. And so I just want to put that on the record, too. As it relates to right-to-know, if we thought about it more broadly, we get fixated on labels immediately. I would be interested in the panel's response to the possibility of right-to-know with an approach that provided details on modification on a website where individuals could go to get information. I would be curious to know what their reaction would be to that technique.    Mr. Gibson. I know my time is expired, Mr. Chairman. I want to make one final comment and that is that arming people with the information is really what we are talking about here. My family----    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. Really, we have other folks, Chris.    Mr. Gibson. You bet.    The Chairman. So Mrs. Kirkpatrick for 5 minutes?
