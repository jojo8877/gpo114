    Mr. Mooney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Kendall, I have had a lot of dealings with the Department of the Interior in West Virginia. We are dealing with coal mining and other issues. I work with them and deal with them on a lot of issues. I have a few questions for you.    In your semi-annual report to Congress from March, you mentioned that, of the 29 cases you referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution, 17 were declined. Is that correct?    Mr. Mooney. So, they would not prosecute 17. And do you refer all cases where laws are broken to the Department of Justice? I mean, they declined 17. So, are you just referring everything, or do you only refer those where the violations and weight of evidence would likely result in a conviction?    Mr. Mooney. OK, this was since March. Do you have any updated information about how many have been referred and declined since March?    Mr. Mooney. I would appreciate that.    Are all the cases of criminal conduct that you refer to the Department of Justice about employee wrongdoing or do some of them involve non-government employees?    Mr. Mooney. OK. And of the 17 cases that were declined, how many were employees of the Department of the Interior where they violated the law?    Mr. Mooney. OK. And there is the statute of limitations. Is there a statute of limitations on the crimes that Mr. Barton committed?    Mr. Mooney. Do you know when that expires?    Mr. Mooney. OK.    Mr. Mooney. OK. Is there also a statute of limitations for the crimes that Bob Abbey committed?    Mr. Mooney. When would that time out?    Mr. Mooney. How does your typical referral to the Department of Justice work? For example, does your staff develop relationships with specific U.S. Attorneys?    Mr. Mooney. Once the DOJ declines to prosecute a case, do you know if they can prosecute at a later date?    Mr. Mooney. OK. Then would you be willing to refer cases to the Department of Justice again for prosecution if the statute of limitations has not lapsed?    Mr. Mooney. So, you have not done it. Why? I mean, is there any reason you would not do it?    Mr. Mooney. OK. Thank you.    My time is almost up. I will go ahead and yield back.
