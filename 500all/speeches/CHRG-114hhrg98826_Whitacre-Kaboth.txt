    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Good afternoon. Thank you for inviting me to testify. My name is Janet Whitacre-Kaboth. I am the president, CEO, and chairman of the board of Whitacre-Greer Company, which has manufactured clay products in northeastern Ohio since 1916. As we celebrate 100 years in business, we are very proud of our heritage. We operate a manufacturing facility in Alliance, Ohio, that employs approximately 80 people. We manufacture firebrick for the inside of masonry fireplaces and paving brick. In Washington, D.C., paving brick made by Whitacre-Greer form the sidewalks along Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House.    I am here on behalf of my company and the brick industry as a whole, as I serve on the board of the Brick Industry Association. We are a very small company within the brick industry. We only have one plant that has two kilns. Our industry and our company is committed to doing our share and to doing the right thing for our employees, our vendors, customers, and communities.    However, as our industry continues to struggle to come out of the Great Recession, we, like many others, have limited resources. It is extremely important that these limited resources be used judiciously and on the most important issues. It is critical that every dollar we spend gives back some benefit. There are many regulations that affect us, but I am going to talk about two regulations today: the air toxics standard or brick MACT developed by the USEPA; and the proposed revisions to the silica permissible exposure limit, expected to be issued very soon by OSHA. These two rules and their crippling impact on the brick industry illustrate how workers and local communities can be devastated by new regulations.    The current brick MACT is the second time in a decade that the EPA imposed major requirements on our industry. The agency finalized a rule in 2003. Our industry complied with the rule in 2006. But in 2007, the courts vacated the rule. Our industry was in compliance with that rule when it was thrown out, and had spent over $100 million to install 80 of the 100 controls that now exist in our industry. The EPA used the performance of the new controls to establish even lower limits for its current rule, which it finalized in late 2015.    For many brick companies, this will require them to tear out the existing controls that they spent millions on, and purchase more costly new controls in order to produce a slight benefit to the environment. While the brick MACT does allow a health-based standard for some emission types, full compliance will probably require the installation of control devices for particulate matter and mercury for most kilns. For our plant in Alliance, Ohio, the estimated cost is $4 million for control devices and operation. This represents 23 percent of our current net worth, which would eliminate at most 4 pounds of mercury per year.    In September 2014, OSHA proposed revisions to the current PEL for silica. This reduction was proposed as a one-size-fits-all type regulation that is typical. OSHA estimates costs for this rule to average $38,000 per year annualized over a 10-year period for a brick plant. However, compliance would require an initial capital expenditure of about $906,000.    OSHA has been provided a significant set of studies conducted over the last 75 or more years, demonstrating that the response to the silica used in the brick industry is very different from other industries, and they acknowledge the much lower incidence rate of silicosis from our industry. They also separately acknowledge the high costs of their rule. However, they do not put these two pieces of data together and consider our industry separately when attempting to show that the rule is justified.    In both these cases, the statutes that direct EPA and OSHA to develop these rules have flexibilities contained with them to allow these agencies to meet their obligation without destroying our industry. We just do not know how to make them use these flexibilities and to take the time to do it right, rather than just doing it quickly, and to not take a one-size-fits-all approach that will destroy an industry. Compliance with both of these rules at the same time will devastate our already threatened industry, where 75 percent of the companies are small businesses. This is well documented in a report issued earlier this month by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce entitled ``Regulatory Indifference Hurts Vulnerable Communities.''    Practically speaking, from my end, compliance with both these regulations would require me to obtain a loan for $5 million that would add equipment that would not reduce our cost, improve our product, increase our sales, or provide any health benefits for our employees or neighbors. It would be impossible for us to obtain a loan of this size that would not provide us with any benefits. I spent the last 2 years trying to obtain financing for kiln renovation, which would reduce our natural gas cost by approximately $500,000 per year, but it took me 2 years to find a financial institution willing to lend us the money. The cost of compliance with both these regulations at the same time would put us out of business, and we are not the only ones.    If the inability to comply would cause us to go out of business, more than $8 million would be lost from our local community; we would pay over $4 million in wages to 80 families. Many of our employees would have difficulty finding other employment due to their low level of education.    However, if these regulations would save lives of our workers or neighbors, they would be worth it, but for both of these rules, the agencies themselves have data that show that the benefits of these regulations is minimal or nonexistent for our industry.    So, I guess I would like to think that after 100 years of providing good employment, paying taxes, and trying to be a responsible corporate entity, that someone in the government could look at the cumulative effect of this regulation and help us. Thank you.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------    *Note: Supplemental material submitted with this prepared statement is not reprinted in this record but is on file with the Committee, and can also be accessed at:  http://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=104519.                                                                __________    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. I will not tell you what we say about Kent People.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. There you go. You already know.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Yes. Basically it is clay and shale, raw materials from the ground. We used to use coal to burn them; now we use natural gas.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Right.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Yes.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Yes.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Correct.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Yes.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Yes, that is correct.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Yes.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Yes.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. That is correct.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Yes.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. We have a kiln that was built in 1955. Our second kiln, we have been renovating, and it was built in 1960.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Yes.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Yes.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. That would be really nice.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Yes, that is correct.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. Yes.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. My family has owned this company for 100 years, and a few years ago we had to make a decision with our next generation of owners if we wanted to continue to make brick, or if we wanted to try and cash out. It was becoming more expensive to be a manufacturer. The markets were smaller, and one of the things that we really talked about was the role of regulation. How much were we going to have to spend in the future, and would it be worth it? It is expensive to make brick. Everything about it is expensive, frankly. However, when we talked about it with the entire--we got the entire family together, and we all wanted to invest in continuing to make brick. And it was not just us, because the people that we work with--we have worked with their families for a long time, and we feel responsible for the 80 people that work at our plant. It is not very many people, but they are our people and we want them to continue to have jobs.    Ms. Whitacre-Kaboth. None at Whitacre-Greer, which is what I know. None.
