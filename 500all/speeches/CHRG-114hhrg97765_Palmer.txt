    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Madam Chairman.    Dr. Hager, in the past, NITRD Program has had problems with the way in which participating agencies categorized their NITRD budgets. Is that still a problem?    Mr. Palmer. Do you--does NITRD, which is a--is the main source of federally funded information technology. Is there anything being done to ensure that there's no duplicate research that's being done in the agencies? Would you like to respond to that, Dr. Marzullo?    Mr. Palmer. That's right. Thanks.    Dr. Hager, your testimony mentions the tension between purchasing the long-term foundational research and short-term problem-solving research. How is NITRD approaching that problem?    Mr. Palmer. And this question can apply to all of you, but in terms of the short-term problem-solving research, is that something that the private sector could play a greater role in and leave the longer-term stuff to the federal government?    Mr. Palmer. Well, this is fascinating and necessary work, and I want to thank you for being here today. And one of the more polite groups of witnesses we've had. Thank you.    Chairwoman Comstock. I now recognize Mr. Abraham for five minutes.
