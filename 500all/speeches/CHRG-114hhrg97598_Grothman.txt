    Mr. Grothman. Okay. I've been in another hearing so I hope I don't repeat some questions.    First of all, I want to point out that overall, you know, we're kind of highlighting Mexico here. And just reviewing the murder rates around the country, Mexico was far from the most violent country in the world, right? I mean, you have countries like Jamaica or El Salvador that are maybe twice the murder rate or Honduras which is four times the murder rate of Mexico.    But Mexico does have a high murder rate. I think it's about four times--over four times the American rate. Five times--I say four times the American rate. I wonder if some of you could maybe comment on the differences in some cities compared to other cities and whether you think it is right now particularly dangerous in these cities with the higher rates themselves.    Mr. Grothman. Do we have a facility in Acapulco?    Mr. Grothman. That's an example of one, just pulling it up, that looks to be a very, very dangerous city. But could you let me know, I mean, is that like some American cities where overall it's dangerous but there are a lot of areas that are okay? I mean, because that is one, just pulling it up, that is just, you know, I think the murder rate is like three times that in Milwaukee where I'm near, and that's not a very well run city.    But you do feel that--I mean, do you feel our people are safe in a city like that? If you stick in the right areas, or is it----    Mr. Grothman. Just by point of reference, of all the Americans working in Mexico right now who work for the American Government, how many work there overall and how many have been victims, say, of some sort of crime in the last year?    Mr. Grothman. Since 1985----    Mr. Grothman. Since when?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. So two Americans have been killed out of a little under 3--when we have 3,000 employees. We've had about two murders in the last 30 years is what you're saying?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Thank you.    I yield the rest of my time.
