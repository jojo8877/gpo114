    Mr. Gallego. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Secretary Jewell, thank you for being here and working to address the real issue of abandoned mines that are threatening our environment and our communities. I want to focus on the impact of these releases on our Native American communities, and how the EPA is improving its communications to tribal jurisdictions.    EPA Assistant Administrator Mathy Stanislaus previously testified at the House Science Committee that one of the initial lessons that we learned in the aftermath of the Gold King Mine release is that the EPA can improve its communications regarding releases and other environmental events that may affect multiple jurisdictions.    Can you elaborate and, where possible, provide an update on how the EPA is working to improve those communications, specifically to our tribal communities?    Mr. Gallego. Certainly, in talking to some of my friends in the Navajo Nation, I think that would have--the problem existed, obviously. The spill is a problem, but also how it was handled afterwards, and what seemed to be not a very coherent messaging program added insult to injury. I really encourage EPA and everyone else involved to work on that, especially concerning how many mines we have in Arizona. As a Member from Arizona, I am afraid this may be happening again. Thank you.
