    Mr. Salmon. Thanks, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for drafting this important bill and bringing it up so quickly at the beginning of the Congress. I have consistently supported any measures and legislation that would hold North Korea accountable to its intolerable actions.    Mr. Salmon. Oh, the en bloc amendment. Thank you.    Mr. Salmon. Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I greatly appreciate your tenacity on this issue, and the ranking member. And I am very, very hopeful that this year it will actually pass the Senate and get to the President's desk because I think it is vitally needed. It is legendary what bad actions that Korea--North Korea--has taken on the world stage both in terms of its nuclear proliferation and threats as well as its cyberterrorism with Sony Pictures, and if we don't start drawing some hard lines in the sand now, this escalation will continue.    The one thing I would like to point out is that we will be going to visit the folks in China in the not-so-distant future, and I am really hopeful that China takes more of an interest in containing North Korea. They have a disproportionate influence than any other country in the world because of North Korea's dependence on their--for their economic wellbeing. And I truly do believe that Beijing has a big hand to play, and I am disappointed that they haven't.    I hope that we will continue to encourage them to do the responsible thing because it is not only in the world's best interest, but it is in their best interest too. So, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for doing this yet one more time, and let's get it across the finish line this time. Thank you.
