    Mr. Sullivan. Good morning, Mr. Chairman Barletta, Ranking Member Carson, and members of the subcommittee. I am happy to be here today to discuss how VA provides critically needed healthcare services to veterans through a wide variety of leased facilities. The Department maintains approximately 155 million square feet in more than 6,000 owned buildings as well as 33,000 acres of land. In addition to our own facilities, VA has approximately 2,000 leased facilities totaling 25 million square feet.    VA's portfolio is one of the largest in the Federal Government and provides a significant amount of health care to veterans in these leased facilities. In our leased facilities, we provide primary care, mental health, and specialty services, such as ophthalmology, oncology, endocrinology, cardiology, pulmonology, podiatry, neurology, just to name a few.    We also provide pharmacy services, radiology and imaging and same-day outpatient surgery in some of our larger clinics.    Today, I ask for your support to help provide these services to our veterans. VA is requesting the committee's approval of eight pending leases that represent an additional capacity over 1.2 million annual visits to these clinics for our veterans. These eight leases are needed to ensure that VA has the right sized facilities in place to serve veterans with the right services and in the right locations where veterans want them.    Leasing is a critically important tool that allows VA to provide services to veterans. Leasing provides flexibility in lieu of constructing owned assets to meet veterans needs. Leasing enables VA to quickly respond to healthcare advances and to adopt important--more importantly, to changing medical technology in order to provide state-of-the-art health care to veterans. Meeting the ever-changing pace of medical advancement is a constant challenge for any medical system, and VA finds that leasing versus owning provides one of the most flexible approaches to meet that challenge. Leasing also allows us to rapidly adjust to current and future demographic shifts in changing service demands for our veterans.    VA clearly doesn't need more owned legacy assets to address our outpatient access needs. We have enough of old and obsolete facilities, we do not want to add any more to our current portfolio.    For leasing, VA has the ability when these assets become unneeded or obsolete or do not meet current medical practices to walk away at the end of the lease term. In addition to these 8 leases we are requesting the committee's action on, VA has 24 additional medical leases that are pending congressional action. These critically needed leases will replace, expand, or create new outpatient clinics, research facilities, and provide more than 2.7 million more annual healthcare visits for our veterans and enhance our research capabilities nationwide.    As VA works to meet the challenge of addressing these changing and ongoing demand of health care, these leases, both the eight we mentioned earlier on and the 24, will go a great way to help meet these needs.    As you were aware, VA relies on the authority and has for the last 20 years that is delegated from GSA to enter into all lease agreements. VA depends on its partnership with GSA to obtain individual delegations, to make operating leases feasible to provide services. Our agencies have worked to make improvements, and the delegation process has evolved over the last 2 years.    I want to thank GSA for their partnership and their help in having us move forward with these leases and to provide services to our veterans. They have been more than a willing partner in this effort.    VA is also pleased that GAO in its 2016 report recognized the important need for medical leasing and the flexibility that leasing provides VA. As stated in the report, GAO recognized that leasing allows VA to align its infrastructure more easily with changing healthcare needs. The report highlights some of the improvements VA has made while operating under the GSA lease delegation process and suggests other agencies can implement other processes.    VA fully plans to address the GAO recommendations in terms of further articulating in our budget submissions to Congress via advantages of the flexibility leasing provides, as well as addressing some of the technical recommendations involving cost estimating.    We have agreed to do that and are working with the lessons learned effort to implement and consult with GAO as we implement those recommendations.    As VA works to move the pending leases forward, VA is open to any and all suggestion from the committee or from anyone else of how we can improve your process so we can speed the delivery of healthcare services to our veterans and their families.    I am here with my colleagues to answer any question that you may have or any member of the committee may have. Thank you for your time, and we appreciate the committee's support for our veterans and their needs.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Sullivan. Sure. There were six leases that the committee approved back in 2014. Five of the six have been awarded. The last one is Rochester, New York, which should be awarded in the first quarter of 2017, based upon my information from the contracting officials.    The first one Springfield, Missouri, was awarded in February 28, 2016, and we expect to have it open in the spring of 2018. Butler, Pennsylvania, was awarded in December 2014. We expect to accept the building in the summer of 2017. San Jose, California, was awarded in September 2015, and we expect acceptance in the winter of 2017. South Bend, Indiana, this lease was awarded back in July 2015, and we expect to accept the building again in the summer of 2017. Mobile, Alabama, was awarded on August 18th, 2016.    I will be happy to provide the committee with all the specific dates and milestones for each of these leases.    Mr. Sullivan. Yes, Mr. Chairman. We have worked with GSA since that time to establish several efforts to improve the product they received from us and the timeliness of the product that we provide them. We have set up a central clearing house that reviews all the leases that go over to GSA. We set up a peer review to make sure that the products are of top-notch quality that go over to GSA. And I think that's been demonstrated in the quick turnaround time that we have an average of 20- to 25-day turnaround time for leases that don't require external approval.    We have also set up tracking systems so in VA we know where every single lease is, both our leases that are in the procurement chain that GSA sees but also all of our existing leases. So for the first time, we have a complete inventory of all leases in process that are executed, all leases that are operating, and all leases that are in the procurement process, as well as all leases pending congressional action.    We have also set up an integrated budget tool for the first time in 2017, and it will be reflected in our 2018 estimates to Congress where we allocate the funds and track the funds based upon the schedules of our 1,200 leases of when we will need the money, and what year we will need the money, and whether we need capital money or we need the FTE associated with it.    So we have a really, I think, a good handle on what our requirements are and what--importantly, what is the liability of those requirements as we go out in time. Because as we have seen, as many of the members that are on the Veterans' Affairs Committee have seen, an influx of significant workload. We have put our leases in place and have predicted what the liability of those leases will be in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020. We do it out 5 years now, so that is a big improvement that we started to address the leasing.    We have also set up internal training sessions. As you imagine, VA is a very complex organization, spread across the country. And many of our small leasing below $1 million is done in the fields, so it is important for us to train and provide expertise, and GSA has helped us do that to those people who are actually executing the leases.    So I think we have taken a lot of steps. It is not perfect by any means. And as we go through the various budget estimates that come out each year, we get a little bit better a little refiner and we integrate our data and provide a better estimate to Congress of our liabilities.    Mr. Sullivan. On the eight that are coming up to the committee now? Two reasons, really. When we submitted the last batch, we took the ones based upon the priority of where they were in development, how complicated they were. And the ones that we knew were closest to award, we submitted to the committee in the first six.    The last eight are probably the more complex, larger leases where we had to do the market research, the planning for the space requirements and the design requirements for those leases, so those took a little bit more time. So it was more of a priority of what we could get through and what we were ready to present. We did not want to present the committee with an incomplete package.    Mr. Sullivan. VA develops a rigorous business case for each of its leased actions. And in that, the business cases flow up from the clinicians in the field who actually are delivering care to the veterans. And we look at them to, first, look at whether they need a capital asset in the first place. They look at other alternatives before they look at leasing to see if that is more cost effective or more appropriate to do, and then they look at build, and then they look at lease.    In terms of the cost analysis, we look at what the industry standards are. We look at what indices are showing of what leases should cost adjusting them for some of the Federal standards to ensure that we are submitting reasonable costs to the Congress when we submit these proposals. And then when our contracting folks execute it, they have to ensure that the cost, the rental rates, we are paying for these leases are reasonable.    One thing I would say on cost, Mr. Carson----    Mr. Sullivan . Is when you look at the real estate costs of providing care to veterans, we did a little analysis a few weeks ago. And looked at what we see in the lifecycle of a lease. When you look at a lease when you are providing care for veterans, the real estate costs of a lease are less than 9 or 10 percent of what the cost it is to provide care for veterans. When you really look at it, the real cost of deciding to put a clinic in, it is the docs; it is the nurses, it is the schedulers, it is all of those people that are there, and the real estate costs are really the small amount.    So when we look at the consideration, we have always put with the question by people, you know, you could have a real estate solution that is 25 miles down the road that is $3 cheaper a square foot. But if the veterans, where they are, where they live are 25 miles away, our alternative has always been to put the clinic where the veterans are, closer to them, even if there is a cost difference. We look at in the life of the lease, it is more important to provide the right services where the veterans are rather than to get, say, a primo real estate deal 45 miles away. And we have had where people have come in and said, hey, we could save you $10 a square foot if you move 60 miles down the road. I guess you could, but the people wouldn't have access to it.    The same thing in metropolitan areas. People are saying, well, if you can move one, you know, the other side of New York City, I could get you $3 off. Well, if the veterans are in Manhattan, you are going to put it all the way out in Queens, people in the area, that is a 2-hour commute difference. That is a huge impact on veterans. We look at the costs that way as well. Thank you.    Mr. Sullivan. I think we are talking a little bit of different levels of information. In the prospectuses that we send to Congress, we articulate why we wanted to use leasing, and we articulate the flexibility that----    Mr. Sullivan. To us, it is a big benefit. When we look at what we--when we provide outpatient services in a leased facility over--most of our leases are 15 to 20 years. If you look at the changes in medical technology, 20 years ago where you are, you know, standard practice now is, for example, to have a CAT scan, to have an MRI scan, to have some oncology services----    Mr. Sullivan. From a public sector standpoint is that we don't have an obsolete, outdated facility at the end of 20 years that we have to go back in and retrofit if we owned it. And we have, unfortunately, many of those facilities in VA, and we don't want to add more to that stock.    Mr. Sullivan. Correct.    Mr. Sullivan. There is--depending upon the transaction, there can be a residual value. But at this point, if we were to build instead of lease and we--from the beginning, we would need to have all of that money upfront. So right now, in a big lease, say of 200,000 square feet, we are paying, say, $3 million a year in rent, or $4 million, depending on the market, where it is. We would need to have $35 million----    Mr. Sullivan. In your example, yes.    Mr. Sullivan. We have a detailed healthcare planning model that goes all the way down to the zip code.    Mr. Sullivan. It comes from external contractors that take census data, utilization data.    Mr. Sullivan. I don't actually do that. We get that from an office of healthcare----    Mr. Sullivan. I believe there are two things I was saying. We get overall projections of what the need is in the catchment area for a clinic; i.e., based upon census data, veteran pop in the future, and expected utilization. We then go down to the clinicians at the local level. Those clinicians at the local establish what is known as the delineated service area for that procurement. They determine, based upon their knowledge of the local market, the local preferences of veterans, and local clinical availability of resources where the type, delineated service area would be for where they believe those veterans will come for services. That is going to be different based upon each and every market. So they reach down. And they are the ones who establish the delineated service areas.    Now, our folks here in Washington cannot, you know, come up with a delineated service area, because they know what the local market is and what the local----    Mr. Sullivan. Yes. Correct.    Mr. Sullivan. I would have to get for you, but I would say numerous places that we have move----    Mr. Sullivan. Sure. It would take a little bit of data, but we could get that to you.        Mr. Sullivan. The VA does support your bill, and we support your efforts to look at the streamlining of the authorization process that is outlined in your bill.    Mr. Sullivan. Yes. We believe leasing we can deliver there quicker. We can put an asset in place quicker--sorry.    We believe that leasing provides a more expeditious way to provide healthcare services to veterans. We believe leasing is the right thing to do in terms of allowing us to change the types of services we need if we--at the end of the lease or if we have a shorter term lease. We believe technology is the big driver in health care. And for us to be able to have a 20-year old facility that took 2 years to plan, so 22 years out, that that technology is going to change, especially in the area of radiology, imaging, oncology, and those areas. It is night and day what it was 20 years ago, and we need to be able to have those facilities that have that up-to-date technology.    There are challenges with the leasing process, I don't doubt that at all. But we believe that flexibility and also the flexibility if we have a new cadre of veterans that come in that demand new services that we don't know about today, leasing will allow us to shift, to provide those services where they are. And especially as we deal with some of the younger veterans coming into--from the Persian Gulf wars and more recently that their need for services are different and they want them in a different time in a different place than people who are from the World War II Vietnam era. So we need to balance that as we go forward, and we think leasing provides us flexibility.    There is a need for owned assets. I am not saying there isn't. But in the outpatient arena where access is key, we believe that that is important.    Mr. Sullivan. Sure. I will try and take them as I jotted them down here. In terms of the cost lessons learned that GAO recommended, what I believe that lessons learn is going to do is, right now we treat each procurement, it goes through a process. We do a fair and reasonable assessment before we award. What we have from that result is we have individual instances of costs. And I think what GAO is saying from a portfolio perspective to take all of those costs as you get them, roll them back into your estimating model.    Right now, it may or may not be done. It is not required, so we have agreed comprehensively to do that. That data is there. It is just a matter of us going forward and pulling it forward.    The same thing on the risk in terms of whether we really move out of these facilities or we really will use them. The data is there in the decentralized environment. And we defer to the locals. When we submit the budget, we can easily pull that data, and we will do if for the committee that shows where we have moved, whether we have upgraded the facility, or whether we have stayed in place.    So I think the data is there for that, and that will really inform, you know, how much risk are we really avoiding by doing this.    I think everyone just intuitively and all the clinicians intuitively live in these facilities day to day, and they know there is no way that they should stay in that facility, not only due to the changes in care, but the security, the setbacks, and all of those things. We take them from their gut, but we need to get the data to make it clear to everybody that that is and that is fair, and we will do that as soon as we can. We have it, just a matter of aligning it.    In terms of the McKinsey report, we will have to get you more specifics on that. I believe some of the comparison made in the McKinsey report was made to private sector healthcare facilities that do not have some of the Federal requirements that we have to handle. But we can get that for you. We are familiar with it. It is a pretty thorough report, and we are happy to provide you and the committee with that.    Mr. Sullivan. Right.    Mr. Sullivan. Right. Because there is a big difference. Our clinics and one of the things we talk about a lot is when you compare an MBO medical office building to a VA clinic, they are very different. And a lot of the benchmarking people use against us are medical offices buildings and----    Mr. Sullivan . Apple to orange. But we are happy to provide that to you. Thank you.    Mr. Sullivan. I can tell you have we have an entire organization that, as Mr. Wisner referenced, is our contracting elements that actually contract and do all of the solicitation, the evaluation, and the selection of the winning proposers on these. I know generally that they validate with benchmarks and appraisals the rates that they pay. I am not that familiar with that case. I would be happy to get you the information or whatever way you want. I would be happy to sit down with you and go through that so you can understand what the process was in that particular case.    Mr. Sullivan. I think there are two levels of data, as I understand it. There is the Federal real property database that is run by an outlet, and it is a little bit out of Mr. Wisner's area, but GSA runs, which includes all Federal assets across all agencies. I believe most of what is in there is civilian-based data for civilian agencies, and I believe that information has been and can be released to committees and other people with interest. I am sure that we could find out what the status with that is.    In addition to that, we have kind of a subsidiary database, if you will, that has a little bit more granularity so we know where all of our assets are, all of our leases are, so between the two of those, I am sure we could provide any information that you would want.    Mr. Sullivan. When we do a procurement for a replacement lease or an expansion, and many of our leases not only replace what is there, but they expand it, we look first to see if there is an existing asset somewhere that we can do. We also check with GSA. As Mr. Wisner said, we are just as happy if we can find a Federal building that has space that is located where veterans are, to us it doesn't--unless there is some special need in that clinic that can't fit within a Federal building--or a lease that GSA has that has come free because another tenant doesn't want it, if there is someone who can use it, we are more than happy to take that.    So we look at existing first because it is going to be usually in a lot of cases if the bare requirements for our lease don't have a lot of specialties in it, we could move in a lot quicker, which means that we can provide services quicker, and that is what we want to do. So we use that as our first look in the procurement process and in the process of delegation to GSA. When we don't find ones there, we do go out, and they end up going through the procurement process.    Mr. Sullivan. It should be noted all of our nonmedical leasing, I mean, we do not portray to have significant expertise in nonmedical leases. So all of our nonmedical leases, whether they are for cemeteries, veteran benefits, or overhead leases, are all done by GSA, as they should be.    Mr. Sullivan. I agree with Mr. Wisner. We are doing three types of standardization. At the lowest level we are doing something called patient-aligned care teams where we set up modules where we predesign what services will be provided and create standardized areas where outpatient services are provided, and we set them up in teams. So you can get one module, two modules, six modules. You build on it.    The second thing we are doing is we are doing a prototype what we are calling, what Mr. Wisner referred to, we have a small, medium, and large prototype for outpatient clinics trying to standardize that process. And then the third effort, which is less mature than those two, is we are looking at all of our contract documents and all of our contract standards that we have out there for building and designing and trying to reduce and make them, to the extent we can, more aligned with what private sector practices are in the healthcare practice, which is an ongoing effort, and we do have a lot to go on that effort, but we believe that is what we need to do to bring us more in align and lower cost. And we are pushing forward to do that, probably on new leases in the coming years, to look at standardizing that more to make it easier for the private sector to come in. Thank you.    Mr. Sullivan. We have about 25 million square feet leased and about 158 million owned, and the lease has significantly increased while the owned has held steady, or we are trying to move it down.    Mr. Sullivan. I don't know if we completely changed our focus, but if we look back about 5 years ago, we had a major change in the way we provided health care, maybe a little bit longer, but we shifted more to the outpatient area. That is when the leases, say, 10 years ago started to take off because we wanted to move it to the outpatient setting, closer to where veterans are, not in the hospital. So we kind of have focusing on us a perfect storm that VA is coming through.    We have a whole series of leases that started 10 or 15 years ago that are all becoming mature, and we need to move out. At the same time, as everyone in our world knows, we have been hit with an unprecedented workload increase, which require new clinics because we don't have the capacity. So you have the expiring old ones and the new ones and then updating all of the new ones for technology and security and safety, so we kind of have this large cloud that is coming at us, and that is what we are trying to work through.    Mr. Sullivan. Earlier, I don't know the particulars of that transaction. I will be happy to get it for you. I know as a matter of policy we try and use benchmarking from existing prevailing rates somewhere else with a like facility.    Mr. Sullivan. Well, in a reasonable area. The contracting officer decides within a reasonable area, is there a comp that is there. And in some cases, as I referenced earlier, there are no comps. I mean, we have places where we put a clinic; there is no healthcare comp anywhere near it. So then they look to see is there an office comp that you can build up off of, and in some cases there might be an office comp and there may not, and they may have to go further away. So it is really market driven.    So I don't think there is inconsistency in the answer because in some cases we have straight comps; you can use them. Others you have an office comp that you build up, and others you will have to go further away. But I don't know the particulars in that case, and we will just have to get it to you.    Mr. Sullivan. I will take it back to the contracting folks and get them in contact with your office.
