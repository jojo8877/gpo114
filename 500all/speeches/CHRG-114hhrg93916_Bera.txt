    Mr. Bera. Thank you, Chairman Smith, and I want to thank Ranking Member Bass for as well for calling this important hearing to discuss the issue of international child abductions and the Goldman Act. I especially want to thank the chairman for his tireless effort and work on this issue.    I also want to thank the witnesses and the left-behind parents for your heartfelt testimony today. It, obviously, cannot be easy, but it is incredibly important to hear these stories.    As we will hear today, this is a serious issue. Approximately 1,000 U.S. children are reported to the State Department as victims of international child abduction annually. These abductions are devastating to families, especially to the children. Many of these children are too young to know what is occurring and are isolated from their left-behind parent. The left-behind parent has to go through a stressful and expensive legal process, and, as we will hear today, not always successfully.    One avenue to pursue in order to combat this issue is to push more countries to sign the Hague Convention. This brings those nations into a legal framework in which they can resolve the issue in a more effective manner. This, however, is not a panacea, but it is a good first step.    In addition, just signing onto the Hague Convention doesn't solve the issue if the countries don't adhere to what is in there. I am going to implore the State Department to continue to push more countries to sign the Hague Convention and continue to work on reuniting left-behind parents with their children.    And, again, I just want to commend the chairman for your tireless work on this issue.    Mr. Bera. Thank you.
