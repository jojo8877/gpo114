    Ms. Kelly. I want to thank the chair and ranking member and our witnesses for holding this important hearing on press freedom in Latin America.    We are truly fortunate to live in and be Representatives of a Nation that recognizes and respects free press. The basis of our Government is to be for and by the people. And in that spirit, the opinion of the people matters. In many ways, the press are guardians of the people's opinion here in America.    That is why I am concerned by reports that our neighbors in Mexico, Venezuela, Honduras, and Ecuador have experienced a deterioration of press freedom. Whether it be politically motivated or the result of criminal activity, this erosion of press freedom in these areas that are valued and respected by our Nation cannot continue.    I look forward to our thoughtful discussion here today about free speech and that threat in our hemisphere. It is critical to the progress and prosperity of our Nation. I want to thank you again.    I yield back.
