    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Russ, you are the chair of the American Healthcare Association----    Mr. Cardenas . Otherwise known as AHCA. Your organization has developed a new payment concept for skilled nursing facilities to create your own bundle. Your payment proposal promotes patient-centered care and high quality facilities while saving the government money.    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you, Mr. Russ. You testified that your organization has six guiding principles that you use to evaluate PAC bundled payment models and that the BACPAC Act either doesn't meet those principles or is unclear. One of those principles is that the policy must preserve a patient's freedom of choice of provider.    Can you speak a bit more about your specific concerns with the BACPAC Act and preserving freedom of provider choice?    Mr. Cardenas. So, is AHCA concerned that there is no mechanism for a beneficiary to seek PAC outside of their coordinator's network without switching to a new coordinator?    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you, Mr. Russ.    Yield back my time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
