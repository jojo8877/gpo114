    Mr. Frazer. Mr. Chairman, my name is Gary Frazer. I am the Assistant Director for Ecological Services with the Fish and Wildlife Service.    Mr. Frazer. Our primary role to date has been working with OSM, and through OSM with the States, to help them deal with compliance with the Endangered Species Act associated with surface mining activities. It has been through that process, our consultation process under the Endangered Species Act, that OSM has been informed about how best to build into their rule these sorts of environmental protections and the coordination mechanisms so that individual projects can be in compliance with the Endangered Species Act and otherwise address conservation of fish and wildlife and aquatic resources.    Mr. Frazer. I have not read their rule. I am not aware, though, that they have given us any veto authority. We do, certainly, play a role in assisting OSM and through OSM any State that administers surface mining programs, a role in helping them ensure compliance with the Endangered Species Act.    There are cases in which a project might not be in compliance, and the Service would be advising OSM and the State in those sorts of circumstances.    But I am not aware of us being in a position of actually having decisionmaking authority.    Mr. Frazer. We will, certainly, do that. We would be happy to talk to you in more detail.
