    Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the ranking member, as well.    Mr. Cordray, let me first of all express some appreciation to the agency, CFPB, for two things, one for the rule change for many of the rural bankers, the post-financial crisis rules which I was a part of, that unintentionally saddled them with cures to ills that they did not have.    Mr. Cleaver. And as they call themselves country bankers, they would say they really appreciate that. The other is the Ask CFPB, this interactive online portal which I think--I don't know whose idea it was but it was great. The people in my district think it was mine but--    Mr. Cleaver. Yes. And I have already done that.    Mr. Cleaver. But before I go to my other question, do you have any data on how much that is working, how well the public is responding?    Mr. Cleaver. Yes. I am doing that and I would also encourage my colleagues to do so. I think it is one of the best things that is going on in the agency. But on the other side, I want to talk about the mandatory arbitration.    Now, I am assuming that you are going to--that the agency will issue some rules with regard to the mandatory arbitration. I don't even think--most people don't even think about mandatory arbitration until they have a problem with a credit card company. And then all of a sudden, they start talking about suing and then they discover little tiny print which essentially prevents them from going to court.    Because they have agreed--it is my understanding that they agree not to go to court when they get the credit card. They sign the credit card saying, I am hereby agreeing to arbitration. Is there anything--I am sure the credit card companies are pushing back on that--that may ultimately require legislation or is this something that CFPB can deal with through rules only?    Mr. Cleaver. To the study--    Mr. Cleaver. Okay.    Mr. Cleaver. Thank you very much. I yield back the balance of my time.
