    Mr. Perlmutter. Thanks, Mr. Chair. Just a couple questions. I find this so fascinating and so over my pay grade I don't know what to tell you. And you four really are inspiring to me. You talked about being inspiration to your students. You're inspiring to all of us. And thank you for your patience and, you know, looking at this and talking about the space time continuum and warp speed and worm holes and I don't know what else. But just sort of just the basic human question for me is like can you describe the first few hours after the detection? Who found out about it? How quickly did, you know, word travel? Was it as fast as the speed of light? Is that how fast the sound was? And just generally how did the scientific community individually and as a whole feel about this discovery? And then I am just opening up and you can go one at a time.    Mr. Perlmutter. Well, thank you. And I yield back.
