    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, before I start, can I inquire of you, the witnesses took an oath and they're still under oath now?    Mr. Carter. Okay. I just want to make sure.    Ms. Bresch, have you ever seen a child have an anaphylactic shock? You ever witness that?    Mr. Carter. Excuse me.    Mr. Carter. You have not?    Mr. Carter. Have you ever gone up to a pharmacy counter and carried a pack of two epinephrines and two EpiPens and told a mother of a child who has had anaphylactic shock, who has an allergy, that the price of that is going to be $600?    Mr. Carter. Have you ever seen a mother cry because she can't afford the medication for her child?    Mr. Carter. Well, the reason I ask you this, Ms. Bresch, is because I have. I've experienced it. I've seen this. I've seen a mother go out and have to call family members to see if she can get the money together to try and see if she can pay for this medication that she knows her child has to have. I've witnessed that firsthand.    None of us are without blame here, Ms. Bresch, none of us, and I include my profession as well.    Let me ask you a couple of yes-or-no questions. First of all, the 608 wholesale acquisition cost, is that AWP.    Mr. Carter. So it's just wholesale acquisition?    Mr. Carter. Okay. Wholesale acquisition cost is $608. You said that your company receives approximately $274, is that right, after rebates and allowances?    Mr. Carter. Okay. So after you take out the expenses like manufacturing, acquisition cost, packing, regulatory compliance, all of those things, your profit is even less than that. Is that correct?    Mr. Carter. Okay. So after you do that, Ms. Bresch, do you have any contracts with PBMs? Does Mylan have any contracts with any pharmacy benefit managers, PBMs?    Mr. Carter. You do have contracts with PBMs?    Mr. Carter. Okay. Can you describe some of those contracts for me, very briefly?    Mr. Carter. Okay. So we established earlier that over half of the list price does not go to Mylan. Do you know how much the PBM receives?    Mr. Carter. I understand, but do you know specifically how much the PBM, the pharmacy benefits manager receives?    Mr. Carter. Nor do I, and I'm the pharmacist, and I don't know either. In fact, nobody knows. That's the problem. Nobody knows how much of this is going to the pharmacy benefits manager, because there is no transparency. That's the problem.    Do you know how much the PBM receives in rebates and other fees that are related to the EpiPen whenever one is adjudicated through a pharmacy?    Mr. Carter. You don't. Nor do I. All I know is that my computer calls the insurance and they tell me how much I'm supposed to charge a patient. I don't know how much you're getting as a manufacturer. I don't how much the insurance company is getting. I don't know how much the PBM is getting. That's where transparency comes in. That's what we need.    Do you know how much of the EpiPen savings, the related savings and rebates that the PBM gives back to Mylan? You said you had contracts with PBMs. How much do you get back from the     Mr. Carter. All right. Remember you're under oath. Do you know how much you get back in rebates from a PBM?    Mr. Carter. Do you know? Can you provide us with that information?    Mr. Chairman, can I ask for that information.    Mr. Carter. Okay. So you don't know how much the PBM receives or keeps for itself, nor do I, nor does anyone else, whether it's the manufacturer, the insurer, or the pharmacist, none of us know.    What we do know is this. Prescription prices, prescription drug prices have soared, and so have the profits of PBMs. They are in the billions of dollars.    Until we have more transparency in the PBM market, we are going to continue to see these kind of cost increases. We're going to continue to see them.    That's why we need bills like House Resolution 244. My good friend, Representative Doug Collins from Georgia, has introduced this bill dealing with the MAC transparencies. It's called the MAC Transparency Act. This would help us and take a step towards transparency.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you. I want to thank you for holding this hearing today. And I want to reiterate my request that I have made to you and to this committee from time to time about further investigating how deceptive practice by PBMs are impacting drug prices.    Would you agree with that, Ms. Bresch?    Mr. Carter. The system isn't kept pace? PBMs have had billions of dollars, billions of dollars in profits, yet I have to sit there and take a prescription to the counter to a mother whose child has suffered from anaphylactic shock and watch her cry and watch her have to call family members in order to get the money to pay for this medication.    And we don't know where it's going. You say it's not going to you. Where is it going? I need to tell her. I need to tell her where that money is going.    Mr. Carter. No, don't go there. You know I know better than that. That is wholly--that is just--that is a crock, and you know that I know that. It is. There is no difference whatsoever.    Now, Ms. Bresch, don't----    Mr. Carter. You cut the price in half. Do not do that to me. Don't try to convince me that you are doing us a favor here. You are not doing a favor by that. You could have dropped the price of EpiPens just as well, but instead you said, no, we're going to make a generic.    Mr. Carter. Oh, no, no.    Mr. Carter. You did not want to cut the price on the EpiPen brand, whatever you want to call it, because you wouldn't have gotten your rebates from the PBMs like you get them now. I am waiting for the information that you have promised me that you will send to this committee.    Mr. Chairman, I am going to hold her to that.    Mr. Carter. Are you getting a rebate on those generics from the PBMs? Are you getting a rebate on the generic version of EpiPen from the PBMs?    Mr. Carter. But are you planning on getting a rebate? Are you planning on getting a rebate from the PBM for the generic version of EpiPen that you are introducing?    Mr. Carter. Remember the oath, I'll tell the truth.    Mr. Carter. I yield.    Mr. Carter. That's not what he's talking about. You know what he's talking about.    Mr. Carter. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time. This is a shell game. That's all it is.    Ms. Bresch, I hope you never have the experience of going to a counter and telling the mother of a child who has suffered from anaphylactic shock that she needs to pony up with $600. I hope you never experience that, Ms. Bresch.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I'll be very brief. I find the chart very interesting. Can you hold it up a little more? I can't see the very bottom of it. Okay. So we've got wholesale acquisition costs at $608, rebates and allowances. This is what you give back to patients. And so that's minus $334?    Mr. Carter. So you're giving a rebate to a PBM?    Mr. Carter. You're giving a rebate to a PBM?    Mr. Carter. That's where that comes in there.    Mr. Carter. It's part of it.    Mr. Carter. Okay. So you're giving a--what are allowances?    Mr. Carter. Okay. Are you getting any rebates from PBMs?    Mr. Carter. Okay. I understand that, but that was not my question. I didn't ask you for a number. I said, are you getting rebates from a PBM?    Mr. Carter. Yes or no, are you getting rebates from a PBM?    Mr. Carter. Are you getting rebates from a PBM?    Mr. Carter. So you are not getting----    Mr. Carter. --rebates from a PBM?    Mr. Carter. You just told me earlier you were going to produce documents that would give us your numbers.    Mr. Carter. This is amazing. This is amazing. I have never in my life seen such a shell game. I'm speechless, and that doesn't happen very often.    Mr. Carter. Okay. Let me ask one more question, and then I'll stop. Can you hold it up again?    Mr. Carter. You took an oath earlier today saying you would tell the truth.    Mr. Carter. Is that the truth, $50 per pen?    Mr. Carter. That is the truth?    Mr. Carter. Mr. Chairman, I yield.
