    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Kellen, you mentioned earlier that many people, employees at the EPA just wanted to do their job, and if the managers could get out of their way, they would be able to do so.    And just to counter a bit the gentleman from Virginia, we are not talking about an agenda against clean air or safety or that type of thing, but there are many businessowners out there, quite frankly, who feel the same way about the EPA as the people who are working there. They just want to get the EPA off their back and allow them to do their business without being bullied by the culture that is within the EPA.    But I do want to go specifically to some of the issues you brought up regarding retaliation. There has been quite a bit mentioned in that regard here today.    In your opinion, what kind of retaliation is there? We have mentioned bullying, perhaps changing of positions. But, specifically, what type of retaliation is there against people who report these types of thing?    Mr. Hice. And what would they use that information, whatever they found? Would it be used in a blackmail kind of way? Or how would they use it?    Mr. Hice. Okay. All right. So it was an attempt to find something in order to fire her.    Mr. Hice. All right.    I am sorry. Continue, please.    Mr. Hice. But there's multiple types of retaliation.    Dr. Bohlen, real----    Mr. Hice. --quickly, please.    Mr. Hice. You mentioned earlier specifically intimidation.    Mr. Hice. So there's quite a bit of about. All right.    How prevalent is retaliation in the culture?    Mr. Hice. Yeah, but do so quickly. My time is running out.    Mr. Hice. Okay.    All right. How prevalent is this?    Mr. Hice. All right. So this is not--these are not out of the ordinary, these are not exceptions. The entire culture is a culture of you fall in line, you do as you are told, or you will suffer consequences.    Mr. Hice. All right.    All of you would agree with that?    Mr. Hice. That would be the exception.    Mr. Hice. No, not necessarily.    Mr. Hice. All right. But it is not uncommon? Is it safe to say it is not an uncommon----    Mr. Hice. Sure.    Mr. Hice. Okay.    What are the options that a person has? If they want to identify harassment or they've seen something that they want to report, what are the legitimate options, given the fact that there is a culture of retaliation if they go forward?    Mr. Hice. What about the person whose there, though? I mean, do they feel like there are options, or do they feel like they just have to be silenced?    Mr. Hice. All right. So they do not feel comfortable.    Mr. Hice. Okay.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I would like to begin by going back to the topic from my colleague from Wyoming. The U.S. Geological Survey, I am sure you are aware, has the manatee on the endangered list. And they rely on power plants as a source of warm water during the wintertime.    And you had mentioned a moment ago that, to your knowledge, the EPA never contacted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or National Marine Fisheries Service. Is that correct?    Mr. Hice. So who has had those conversations?    Mr. Hice. You ``guess.'' So you do not know who is responsible?    Mr. Hice. Well, it needs to be on the radar screen; this is the law.    Mr. Hice. The law requires you to contact them, and you do not have any idea if they were contacted or not.    Mr. Hice. And you are also indicating that you do not know if anyone else did either, because you are saying you guess it might have been one department or another. So you do not know.    Mr. Hice. Okay. But you do not know if those agencies were contacted.    Mr. Hice. I am not talking about you. I am talking about the EPA in general. Did the EPA abide by the law----    Mr. Hice. Did the EPA abide by the law and consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or National Marine Fisheries?    Mr. Hice. So you do not know, is the answer.    Mr. Hice. So are you saying yes or no or you do not know?    Mr. Hice. Okay. That is what I was trying to get to. All right. So you do not know if the law was upheld or not.    Mr. Hice. All right.    Well, you realize that the EPA's proposed rule ultimately is going to shut down a number of coal-generated power plants.    Mr. Hice. There have been a number of those. One of them is in my own district.    Mr. Hice. Plant Branch was closed down because of EPA regulations and so forth. And this----    Mr. Hice. Plant Branch in Milledgeville, Georgia, shut down because of the EPA regulations, and hundreds of jobs have been lost because of that. And the manatee, of course, not in my district but relies in other areas on the warm water generated here. And it just sounds to me, again, that the EPA is not abiding by the law.    What would happen if a business decided that they were just not going to abide by regulations from the EPA? Would you ignore that?    Mr. Hice. Well, EPA has been ignoring the law, and it is not--do you believe that all coal plants should be shut down?    Mr. Hice. You do not have a belief system?    Mr. Hice. Do you believe that coal generates power?    Mr. Hice. It is a factual issue. Do you believe that they should be shut down because they are coal-generated?    Mr. Hice. That was not my question. I know they offer----    Mr. Hice. --value because the offer energy.    Mr. Hice. You are having a difficult time understanding my question. I am asking, do you believe that coal plants should be shut down?    Mr. Hice. Okay.    Mr. Hice. Are you aware that EPA policies and regulations are skyrocketing the ability for coal-generated power plants to exist?    Mr. Hice. Coal is becoming expensive because of the upgrades that are required by plants to uphold the regulations put upon them by the EPA.    Mr. Hice. My time has expired. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
