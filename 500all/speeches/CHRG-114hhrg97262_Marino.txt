    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Chairman.    Good afternoon. Good morning. It's good to see you.    Mr. Marino. I, too, am a maniac for the rule of law. As you're aware, most of my adult career was in law enforcement, and I still consider myself a law enforcement guy. My family has been in law enforcement for a long time as well, so I appreciate your comments concerning oversight and the rule of law, and that's needed very much today. I think even more so today, but I do want to emphasize the fact that I've worked with all agencies, State, local, and Federal, and 99.9 percent of our agents out there are topnotch, and I trust them watching my back at any time.    But, with that, you have very effectively answered two questions that I had that I was going to ask you, so as a result, I will yield back the remainder of my time, and best of luck.
