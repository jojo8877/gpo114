    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Madam Chair.    The--being a former federal employee, Mr. Snell, what are the kinds of communication that you would like to see happen?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you.    And Mr. Esser, the review here that was done would obviously involve the private sector, right, with contractors serving the federal government with some of the reinforcement here? How--was there any review done of that private sector element?    Mr. Tonko. Well, just with the outcome that we had in the situation, were contractors reviewed in this situation that served the federal agencies?    Mr. Tonko. Just the malfunctioning that occurred. As we look over the situation and try to determine where the weaknesses in the system are, what--is there a role that the contractors to the system might have played here or that could have been better collaboration involved in this system? Were there any recommendations that you could make in that regard?    Mr. Tonko. And in those reviews was there a need for better collaboration in this whole process where there could have been perhaps a stronger partnership with those efforts?    Mr. Tonko. And to any of you on the panel, when we look at a situation like this, is there a concern for the amount of available resources to an agency to prevent any of this activity? Is it a function of lack of resources or how those resources have been shared? Would any of you comment on, you know, weak investment or falling short in the resources we require?
