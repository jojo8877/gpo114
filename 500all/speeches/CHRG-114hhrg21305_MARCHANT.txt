    Mr. MARCHANT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations on your chairmanship. I really look forward to serving with you.    I got home last night, turned the TV on to watch all of the election results, and----    Mr. MARCHANT . Seemed to be a lot of commercials on TV here in Washington about changes in the Medicare plan. Ms. Baicker, can you tell me what those commercials are about? It's cutting Medicare, call the Administration, tell them not to cut Medicare Advantage benefits and plans.    Mr. MARCHANT. Yeah?    Mr. MARCHANT. Well, I think those commercials are directed at the Administration, so maybe they're missing the mark. Unfortunately, if I want to get any kind of news, I have to view them now.    So, Mr. Guterman, do you have any idea?    Mr. MARCHANT. Because this is beginning to trickle down to my district. I'm going to get emails and phone calls about it now, and so I feel like I need to understand a little better----    Mr. MARCHANT. Yeah, so the source of this is not a group of Medicare Advantage patients that feel like they're going to be aggrieved. It's the people that are being reimbursed that feel like they're----    Mr. MARCHANT. Okay. Mr. Moffit.
