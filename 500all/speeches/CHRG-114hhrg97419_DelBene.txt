    Ms. DelBene. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thanks for calling this important and timely hearing.    And thanks to all of you for being here with us today.    First, I want to start with Ms. Espinel. As you state in your testimony, quote, ``In striking down the Safe Harbor, the Court of Justice focused on issues around national security and law enforcement access to data. Troubled by the Snowden leaks, the court concluded that countries that permit indiscriminate surveillance and interception, and mass and undifferentiated accessing of personal data could not be deemed adequate under EU law,'' end quote.    While the national security piece is certainly something familiar to members of this Committee, could you elaborate a bit on why the EU might be concerned about current U.S. law on law enforcement access to data?    Ms. DelBene. And are there examples right now that you've seen in terms of how the lack of certainty has impacted businesses today?    Ms. DelBene. Thank you.    You know, I had a meeting with a group visiting from the EU a few weeks ago, and someone--part of that group from the EU said that he felt like Americans don't care about privacy. And so are we contributing to that negative narrative about how privacy is viewed in the U.S. by failing to address some of these questions and policy ourselves?    Ms. DelBene. Thank you.    I wanted to get one more quick question in for Dr. Atkinson. You spoke earlier about things that you thought we could do to bolster our credibility and standing to fight data protection, and you talked about kind of some of the other steps we could do beyond judicial redress, which we just did. And I wonder if you could be more specific and tell us about some of those other steps we could take with our own privacy laws.    Ms. DelBene. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
