    Mr. Kildee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank my friend from Michigan for holding this hearing. It is an important discussion. I want to start off with Mr. Morris, and ask you to make some observations on the global need for water infrastructure.    And I just want to point out a bit of an irony. I come from Flint, Michigan, which is currently going through its own emergency related to available drinking water. It has been revealed that the water source that the City has been using is highly corrosive, and has led to lead levels in the water that have made it very dangerous, undrinkable, and has forced unanticipated expenditures in the tens of millions of dollars for a City that has an annual budget of $50 million.    I point this out because this is a situation, a condition occurring in my district, in the State of Michigan, in the richest country in the world, at the richest time in its history, and we have a hard time finding ways to sustain water infrastructure.    I wondered if you could discuss, and I would ask maybe each of you to offer any observations on the difficulties in developing water infrastructure in economies that are far less robust than the one that I represent. And what the hurdles look like, and, I guess, maybe even further, how water infrastructure fares in terms of project selection as a priority for MDBs.    Mr. Kildee. Would any other panel members like to comment on water infrastructure? Or the particular challenges? I guess, the question I have really has to do with developing these sorts of infrastructure which traditionally we think of as being sort of rate-based, or supported on a market basis. And communities, even challenged communities in this wealthy country, see that as a difficult prospect. What about in nations that have far less robust economies?    Mr. Kildee. Thank you. My time has nearly expired. I just want to say thanks to the chairman for holding this important hearing.    Thank you.
