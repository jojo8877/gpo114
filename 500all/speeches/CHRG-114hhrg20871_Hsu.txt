    Mr.  HSU. I believe there is. I know that General Fusion, the Canadian company, has obtained funding from the Malaysian Government's sovereign fund. I've read that Tri Alpha Energy has received funding from a private equity vehicle created by the Russian Government. We know that China is building many if not most of the devices I showed in my figure 1, and I believe China is also pursuing magneto-inertial fusion, which is the focus of the Alpha ARPA-E program. So I--for some of these things international sources may become the main option.
