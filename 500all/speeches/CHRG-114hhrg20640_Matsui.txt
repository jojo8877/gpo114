    Ms. Matsui. Thank you for yielding.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this second hearing on MACRA. Last year, we joined together in overhauling the broken SGR system, replacing it with one that incentivizes quality over quantity of care, rewards efficiency and encourages the use of breakthrough technologies that will provide more people access to health care across this country.    I am looking forward to discussing ways we can advance the transitions that are already happening and will accelerate with     Today, we are joined by physicians who offer important perspectives and best practices for ensuring that delivery systems continue to make inroads in providing high-quality efficient health care to patients.    One of the ways I believe that we can expand access to care and improve outcomes is through the incorporation of telemedicine and to this new value-based system.    Through telemedicine we truly have the opportunity to better engage patients and their families, improve care coordination with loved ones and maximize efficiency of resources.    As we make inroads into this health system transformation, I look forward to working with you and hearing your perspectives on these important issues. Thank you and I yield back.
