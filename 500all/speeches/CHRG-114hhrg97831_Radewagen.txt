    Ms. RADEWAGEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to welcome the entire panel here today.    My question is specific to my home district. I am familiar with the 30(a) style tax credits and the American Samoa Economic Development Credit. Are you aware of any other tax credits specific for U.S. territories? And if so, which of these would provide the biggest benefit for the territories?    Okay. Can you elaborate on how important these credits are for economic stability in these territories? For example, these tax credits are one of the major reasons our tuna canneries are able to operate in American Samoa, so therefore, these tax credits provide my islands employment.    Ms. RADEWAGEN. Thank you very much. I would appreciate if I could get a little information on my earlier question if that is possible.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
