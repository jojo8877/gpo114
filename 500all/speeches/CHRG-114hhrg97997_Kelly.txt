    Ms. Kelly. When you consider the future of U.S.-Pakistan relations, what do you see as the key aims and drivers of our Pakistan policy?    Ms. Kelly. Where do you think our policies have been most successful? And in looking back, if there was something you could change, what would that be?    Ms. Kelly. Is there something that you think should be altered, or what would that be?    Ms. Kelly. Thank you.    I yield back.
