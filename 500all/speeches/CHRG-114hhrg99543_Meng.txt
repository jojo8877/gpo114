    Ms. MENG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to our ranking member. Thank you to our witness for being here today and all the great work that you are doing.    In your testimony you identify weak oversight and lack of regulatory clarity as among the reasons that under the 8(a) mentor protege program larger companies can end up benefitting more from the program than minority-owned small businesses, which is contrary to the aims of the program and the SBA Act. What resources does the SBA need to strengthen oversight of this program? Can existing loopholes in the regulation be closed? I also want to find out if anything more can be done through outreach and education to enable some of these small businesses to better protect themselves.    Ms. MENG. On the same program, in 2011, the SBA revised its regulations for this program and established additional standards to address the definition of economic disadvantage. In your report you indicate concern that the additional standards are not justified or objective. Can you explain your concerns as well as your recommendation for improving the standards?
