    Mr. Webster. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Darcy, the C-111 south Miami-Dade project is crucial for providing water supply for the Everglades National Park and for south Miami-Dade County. One of the remaining two construction contracts is Contract 8, which is a detention area for south--connecting the south Miami-Dade project to the modified water deliveries to the Everglades National Park. Can you provide a status of Contract 8?    Mr. Webster. Awesome. I would like to get that.    Mr. Webster. General Bostick, first of all, thank you for your service to our country. In February this year, the Corps offered guidance on the implementation of section 1023 of the WRRDA Act. There was a provision in there, that part of that section 1023 was something I really supported in the conference report. Can you give me a status on the update of section 1023 and are there sponsors who are taking advantage of those provisions to deliver projects?    General Bostick. We have completed the implementation guidance on 1023, which is the additional contributions by non-Federal interests. I can't give you a status on whether folks have taken advantage of that, but we have provided the implementation guidance to the field on that particular part of the law.    Mr. Webster. OK. Well, I have a--I have another question, would be specific to 1023. Maybe I can just get with you later and we can find out a little bit more about that, what has happened with it and maybe even a specific example that has to do with the Port of Tampa in Florida, and maybe you could help me with that, too.    General Bostick. We would be happy to follow up with you.    Mr. Webster. Thank you so much.    Yield back, Mr. Chairman.
