    Ms. Clarke. I thank the chairman and I thank our ranking member.    And I thank the Chairwoman for her testimony here this morning.    We all need to remember that the FTC exists not to attack companies, but to protect consumers. Enforcement actions have happened when a company or a person is committing unfair or deceptive acts or practices that harm consumers.    Chairwoman Ramirez, in my view, a number of the bills we are discussing today could have detrimental effects on the FTC's ability to carry out its consumer protection mission. For example, H.R. 5115 codifies select portions of the FTC's statement on unfairness. The bill focuses on portions of the statement that discusses substantial injury, but ignores other portions of the statement, including a discussion of circumstances in which public policy concerns will independently support action by the FTC.    So, can you tell us a bit more about some cases in which the Commission relied on public policy standards?    Ms. Clarke. So, if this bill becomes law, would the Commission be able to bring those types of cases in the future?    Ms. Clarke. Let me turn your attention to FR 5118 that prohibits the FTC from taking enforcement action based on noncompliance with agency-issued guidance. Does the FTC do that now and are enforcement actions brought based on companies' failure to follow guidance?    Ms. Clarke. Correct. I was going to ask that.    Ms. Clarke. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
