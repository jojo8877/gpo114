    Ms. Bordallo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    I guess my question will be to former Deputy Secretary Hale. I look forward to seeing progress in fielding the Long Range Strike Bomber, the capability that we certainly need. So as we look forward in the acquisition process, can you speak to how we can apply lessons learned to keep what will be a long-term program in check, time and costwise?    Ms. Bordallo. Ms. Fox.    Ms. Bordallo. I don't know if you mentioned the time, but I also asked for costwise.    Ms. Bordallo. Thank you very much.    And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Mr. Wittman.
