    Mr. Gallego. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Mr. Weiss, you have mentioned about the need to have economic development as the three-step process to right the ship of Puerto Rico. So far you mentioned EITC. I have some concerns with this. I represent what you could also describe as areas that are mini-Puerto Ricos, 12 percent unemployment, businesses not moving in, things of that nature.    But EITC is very helpful for my constituents because it does bring a little more extra income into their family. And it is also great for the economy because it spurs economic growth. The problem with that is, when you have 12 percent unemployment and growing, many, many people in Puerto Rico are not going to be benefiting from EITC. In terms of spurring the economy, what it will do is spur retail work, but not necessarily any other type of economic jobs, because they still import about 85 percent of everything into that island.    One of the areas I would like to see if we could explore--in my younger years, I worked for the city of Phoenix, and we did some work in terms of economic development--is maybe looking at trying to bring the HUBZone status to the whole island. That has been very helpful for my area, in terms of bringing economic productivity, some new industries, especially light manufacturing, which could be very beneficial to Puerto Rico, as well as potentially trying to use either IDAs or New Market Tax Credits, any creative way possible to basically bring a lot more interest back to Puerto Rico.    I believe with the proper set of tools that could potentially come from this oversight committee in terms of recommendations, or us, as Members of Congress, actually passing these types of policies that would be helpful, that we could actually help spur that. Are there any other ideas besides EITC that you all are thinking about doing?    Mr. Gallego. Thank you. And I yield back the remainder of my time to Congressman Gutierrez.
