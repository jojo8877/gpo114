    Mr. Scott. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.    Ms. Spencer, most of this fanfare is over the abortion services. How many employees were involved in that?    Mr. Scott. Ten hours, okay. And the hourly rate--    Mr. Scott. Total aggregate total. And the expense of an AmeriCorps member is about $10 an hour give or take?    Mr. Scott. Full-time, 2,000 hours--    Mr. Scott. It is about, in stipend, it is about $10 an hour. So we are talking about somewhere around $100?    Mr. Scott. Uh-huh. What is the total budget for this grantee?    Mr. Scott. Were they told by outside attorneys that their activities were legal?    Mr. Scott. Right. Did they consult outside attorneys before they reported it? Before you found out?    Mr. Scott. Well, they were told. Before they were told that, did they seek other counsel that gave them the impression that it was not illegal?    Mr. Scott. All right, let me ask Ms. Jeffrey. Did they seek outside counsel and were told that their activities were not inappropriate?    Mr. Scott. Okay, so there was at least some discussion about whether--the legality of this activity. We are talking about $100 out of millions. I mean, we have spent more than that in congressional salaries listening to the opening statements. We have run through $100. I would like to get from the chair how much money has been spent on this subcommittee meeting. If we could provide that for the record so we can put all these numbers in perspective because we are talking about $100 that we are chasing. What has happened to the grantee since then?    Mr. Scott. Well, I only have a couple seconds left. Is it true that they are not being renewed?
