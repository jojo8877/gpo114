    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Walberg. Good to see you. And I hope you have got your wife a trip planned back to Michigan, right?    Mr. Walberg. Good.    Mr. Walberg. Say hi to the U.P., too.    Mr. Walberg. Well, you have got to get one.    Mr. Walberg. You are welcome to do that.    I heard you say nothing is free, and that is absolutely true. So in relationship to some costs, I am concerned about the cost of this proposal, including the potential litigation and administrative costs that may go with it as a result.    How many additional ERISA fiduciary lawsuits do you project will be filed annually if your proposal is finalized?    Mr. Walberg. Any figure that you have considered on additional costs and a number of lawsuits that might be filed?    Mr. Walberg. Well, in order to make sure that happens, how expensive will this proposal be for participants and IRA holders due to increased litigation risks and insurance costs?    Mr. Walberg. But they are worried about the complexity of the regulation that is expanding with this for all sorts of reasons. But there will be litigation costs. Is there any figure out there that you have considered for the best interests because, ultimately, won't these costs just be passed on to the investors?    Mr. Walberg. Well, I mean, expanded regulation always adds some costs. So I guess I will take your answer, but I am concerned that we haven't assumed some greater costs and, ultimately, the impact upon the investor as well as the IRA holders, participants, et cetera. That would be a concern for me. And I guess I would put it out still further.    I would like to see the workup done to ultimately bring satisfaction to your mind that you have seen evidence, and that is fine, that this won't increase the costs and, ultimately, those investors will experience paying for that cost.    Let me jump onto one other thing.    Mr. Walberg. I can understand that. Yesterday, I spent significant amount of time in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the issue of OPM and the data breach that went on there.    We also had in recent months VA in front of us as well.    I was in a classified briefing there also and it was unbelievable the lack of preparation and expertise and ability to handle this with the OPM director. And ultimately, as you are probably aware, there has been a call for her resignation.    In this issue with the increased amount of data that you are going to be pulling in, what are you doing to make sure that data is secure and we have investors as well as the fiduciaries protected from a breach like that?    Mr. Walberg. Yes, it isn't always money. It is preparation and I hope you are prepared to a great degree right now. I would like to have some confidence in that.
