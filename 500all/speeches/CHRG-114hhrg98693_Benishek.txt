    Mr. Benishek. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Halliday, for being here today. Can you elaborate? Is there any role that Ms. Hickey had in any of this that you are aware of? Was she, was there communication between her and Ms. Rubens?    Mr. Benishek. I think you recommended that the Secretary try to recoup the $300,000 that was given to Ms. Rubens. Could you elaborate on that recommendation a bit more?    Mr. Benishek. Recoverable? What does that mean? I mean is----    Mr. Benishek. Right. But I mean if that is truly the case, that this position was not a management mandated, should not all of it be recoverable?    Mr. Benishek. Right. Right. No, I understand. I understand. Can you tell me a little bit more about as I understand it the VA has their own home loan program that sells thousands of homes a year for less than this 27.5 percent service fee. Are you familiar with any of that? Or----    Mr. Benishek. Yes. Is that----    Mr. Benishek. That is different. Okay.    Mr. Benishek. All right.    Mr. Benishek. But this Brookfield, that is a contract with the General Services Administration? That is a general government wide type?    Mr. Benishek. Do you happen to know how many transactions occur, either within the VA or the government as a whole that use this service a year?    Mr. Benishek. All right. I think that is all I have for you now. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will yield back the remainder of my time.    The Chairman. Ms. Titus, you are recognized for five minutes.
