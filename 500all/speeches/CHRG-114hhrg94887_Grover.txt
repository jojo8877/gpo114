    Ms. Grover. No, sir. I am aware that TSA has taken another look at the literature that is underlying each of the indicators that they are using.    They are in the process of testing the use of the new indicators and the new rules for using them at airports right now, and we are awaiting the results of those tests to see what TSA learns about how they are actually being applied in practice.    Ms. Grover. Yes, sir. As of this hearing, I have not reviewed evidence from TSA demonstrating that the behavioral indicators are working in practice as they intend.    Ms. Grover. No, sir, but that is a potential vulnerability that we have identified in our previous reports also, the importance of recurrent vetting.
