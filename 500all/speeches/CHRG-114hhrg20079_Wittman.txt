    Mr. Wittman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks for your service.    I wanted to talk about two issues I believe we see of the Navy force structure. One is amphibious lift. I think we are doing more to address that this year. I want to thank the chairman for all of his efforts and a continuing effort to address what I believe is a shortcoming in amphibious lift.    But I do want to get your perspective on where we are with our submarine force. A couple of different tracks, you see China continuing to grow their fleet moving eastward through the South China Sea into the Pacific, more presence there. Secondly, with the Russians, the fifth-generation submarine, the Yasen-class, the Severodvinsk very, very capable attack submarine. We see those forces going in that direction. We see our forces going in the opposite direction. The 30-year shipbuilding plan shows us going down to a 41-boat force in our attack submarines. We see, too, a gap between Ohio-class retirements, Ohio-class replacement availability. We see back and forth about a national sea-based deterrence fund to make sure that we can fund Ohio-class replacement.    Give me your perspective on what we need to do overall with our submarine force, which I believe is truly going to be the most tactically and strategically important element of our Navy, and not to discount the others, but to have that as part of that, part of the nuclear triad, but also the ability to keep up with pretty advanced submarines with the Russians and the numbers of Chinese submarines that we will see out there.    Give me your perspective on what we need to do both in our attack class, in our Ohio class, to make sure that we counter what we see going on with the other, we will call them, near peers?
