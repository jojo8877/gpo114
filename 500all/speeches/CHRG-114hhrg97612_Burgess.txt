    Mr. Burgess. I thank the gentlelady for yielding.    I have been on this subcommittee for over 10 years now. This has been a recurrent theme that comes up over and over again. So I want to echo what other members have said, that it is important to get this right and to get this solved. We are talking about the Nation's nuclear secrets. This should be the most closely guarded and where the greatest attention to detail should be placed to security issues, and we keep having to come here and discuss breaches.    I do want to acknowledge the help of the Government Accountability Office and, in particular, Allison Bawden, who is one of our witnesses today, who has been enormously helpful to our staff through this and other issues.    And, Mr. Chairman, I will yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Wyka, I have here, I think, three accident investigation reports from the Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management, and in each one there is a judgment-of-need list at the end of the report. And I haven't added them up myself, but I am told by staff that there are 122 judgments of need in these three reports that the Department and the contractors will need to address.    So let's just ask the obvious question. This is 122 judgments of need. Is that a lot?    Mr. Burgess. But, say, going back over the last 10 years, many of these things seem to be recurrent themes. Am I wrong to make that assumption?    Mr. Burgess. Well, why not?    Mr. Burgess. Why not? I mean, again, I have been on this subcommittee for 10 years. We have been dealing with these problems every year that I have been on the subcommittee. The obvious question is why not, or what is it going to take to get these things brought up to standards where we won't be reading these types of headlines and, quite honestly, putting our workers and contractors at risk?    So do we have an answer for that?    Please.    Mr. Burgess. Yes. If I can just interrupt you, because I am going to run out of time. This all sounds wonderful, and I have the transcript from the hearing we had after the Y-12 incident 2 \1/2\ years ago, and I think the same thing was said to us then. So, I mean, again, that is the question.    And, I mean, is Secretary Moniz satisfied with this? Does he think this is acceptable from your department, from the Department of Energy?    Mr. Burgess. I don't mean to be rude, but I am going to interrupt, because they are going to cut me off here in a moment.    Acting Secretary Poneman, last time we had this discussion, over 2 years ago, he said: Our management principles say that we will only succeed by continuous improvement. That was part of the process, so it wouldn't just be mindlessly continuing to check the box, but it would be vigorous and aggressive. I am sorry. We missed the mark, and we need to do better.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
