    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Beyer. This is truly just a great hearing and we are so excited about the results. And as you said, Doctor, it just really--this is inspirational science and sort of fulfills our cravings as human beings for exploration. But what I find really impressive is that--and this has been touched on by some of my colleagues--it's really a decade--decades of partnership and significant funding, I think 1.1 billion total over many, many years going from basic research to building LIGO.    And what I want to know because I feel this is such a success story for us to tell about what it means when you can talk to your students and say you can begin, you can end, and you can remain on this project, what that means. How do you put together a project of this size? How do you keep benchmarks with it? How do you manage something that goes on for many different people over such a long period of time and end with the success that you've had? And I certainly appreciate the classy rollout. But I think that, you know, I'm very interested in how you do that because I think some of the technology that you ended up using you couldn't foresee in the beginning, so if you could just speak to that.    Ms. Clark. And was that a different model, sort of having lots of accountants, or was that just continuation of work you'd done before----    Ms. Clark. --being on a different scale?    Ms. Clark. Yes.    Ms. Clark. Right.    Ms. Clark. Wonderful.    Ms. Clark. Thank you.
