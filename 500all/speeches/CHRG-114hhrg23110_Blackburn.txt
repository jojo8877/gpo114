    Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Dr. Rosekind, I want to say thank you to you. I join the chairman in thanking you for your service and for taking the time to be here.    The issue that we are looking at today and as a part of our Disrupter Series is something that is really important to my constituents in Tennessee because you have the General Motors Spring Hill Plant that is in my district. They are doing much of the green tech innovation. You also have the Nissan North America that is located in my district and then on the outskirts of our district, we have the Toyota Bodine Engine plant.    Now, as I talked to the innovators and the engineers that are working on these next generation concepts, they repeatedly remind me that automobiles are now driving computers and that we need to recognize that and be mindful of it.    And as we look at the Internet of things, of course it is well-placed but as we view this, we also view the necessity for safety and the technology that will make cars safer or help to make them safer will bring forward some of the driverless components, have those interface with the marketplace. Those are issues that are going to be important to us. Reducing fatalities on the road is something that we are very interested in. And when you hear that the self-driving or driverless-directed components can reduce, has the potential to reduce fatalities by 90 percent, that is something, as a mother and a grandmother, that really interests me because we all want to have those opportunities to make vehicles safer.    So, I think you for the time, Mr. Chairman. I thank you for going ahead and moving forward with this hearing and I yield back the balance of my time.
