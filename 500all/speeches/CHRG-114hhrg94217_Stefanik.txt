    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you to both of the witnesses here today.    We have spoken a lot about Iraq, Iran, and I want to turn toward Syria.    Ms. Wormuth, what is the U.S. policy toward the Assad regime? And the reason I am asking this question is, I believe that the brutality of the Assad regime has contributed greatly to the ability for ISIS to rise and gain strongholds in Syria.    Ms. Stefanik. So do you agree with me when I state that the rise of ISIS in Syria is related to the brutality of the Assad regime in providing the circumstances that ISIS has been able to recruit supporters?    Ms. Stefanik. And my other question is, so just to delve further on our policy towards Syria, is it that we oppose the regime in principle but have a policy of taking no actions that would harm the regime's survival?    Ms. Stefanik. I believe, Ms. Wormuth, with all due respect, that the administration's lack of leadership in dealing with the Assad regime and having a coherent Syria policy has led us to where we are today.    Thank you for representing the views, but I fundamentally disagree.    I yield back.    The Chairman. Thank the gentlelady.    Mr. Moulton.
