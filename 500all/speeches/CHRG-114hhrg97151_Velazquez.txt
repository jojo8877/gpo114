    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to also thank Ranking Member Waters. Professor Zywicki, in your testimony you stated that the CFPB was to blame for a decline in new business starts.    Are you aware that the Small Business Administration is on track this year to having the highest record of small business lending since Dodd-Frank was enacted? And also, the NFYV in the latest report of small businesses shows that the optimism index is the highest since Dodd-Frank was enacted.    You even cited a report by the Brookings Institution, and I have it here. I read that report and there is no mention, sir, of the CFPB as a cause for that decline. In fact, the authors say that allowing more highly skilled immigrants into the United States may reverse this downward trend.    By the way, I should tell Mr. Donald Trump that he should read this document and get the story since he said the Latinos are going to love him because he is going to be the President creating jobs. Well, this is the answer to creating jobs.    Instead of dismantling the one Federal agency that looks out for consumers and has refunded them $5.3 billion, don't you think we should instead focus on immigration reform to help spur small business revival as the authors actually stated? Since you brought up this study, I think it is a fair question.    Ms. Velazquez. Right. So that is the central point of this study. It wasn't that Dodd-Frank and the CFPB was the cause.    Ms. Velazquez. Well, sir, there is no mention of the CFPB in this study.    Mr. Silvers, as you know, the Dodd-Frank Act was a complex framework to shore up the financial sectors to prevent future economic collapse.    Five years later, can you tell us what work remains in terms of fulfilling the original intent of Dodd-Frank?    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.
