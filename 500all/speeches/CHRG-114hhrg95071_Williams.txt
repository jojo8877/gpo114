    Mr. Williams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.    I have two questions: the first one to you, Mr. Farah; and the second one to Dr. Asher.    In your testimony this morning, you spoke about how countries likes Iran, whose banks are largely barred from the Western financial systems, have been able to gain access to international markets through countries in Latin America.    Would you help this committee further understand what implications terrorists or criminal groups who are supported or allowed to operate in Latin America have on this country.    Mr. Williams. Thank you for your answer.    Dr. Asher, let me visit with you really quick, and go back to the used car situation.    What was the number of used cars you said were going out of this country? Was it a billion dollars?    Mr. Williams. Okay. So my question is: Who is buying these cars? Were they buying them in auctions? Were they buying them from dealers? Were they buying them from individuals? Where are these cars being purchased?    Mr. Williams. Now, did you say that the cars they are buying are around $2,500 or do they--    Mr. Williams. Okay.    Mr. Williams. So they are beating the system. They know how to beat the system.    Mr. Williams. How are those cars being paid for? Cash, at the--    Mr. Williams. And then you said this, but, again, tell us, so they get these cars. How are they being used?    Mr. Williams. I am in the car business, is the reason I am asking, and I want to talk to you later. Okay?    I yield back my time, Mr. Chairman.
