    Mr. Williams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thanks to all our witnesses for being here today.    I am a small business owner in Texas. I am a car dealer. And you can imagine what I think of the CFPB and how they are issuing laws and so forth. But also it is quite evident that they have largely ignored congressional intent.    As a member of this subcommittee, I am proud to have cosponsored many of the proposals we are discussing today, including H.R. 2121, H.R. 2897, and H.R. 3340. All of these proposals will help reduce the regulatory burdens facing so many families and small businesses in America today, and again speaking of Main Street.    I want to take a second to focus on H.R. 3340, sponsored by my good friend, Congressman Emmer. His proposal, which ultimately brings the budgets for the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research under appropriations, will no doubt provide for greater transparency where it is sorely needed. My first question to you, Mr. Kupiec, is the following: Has the FSOC been transparent through the process of designating MetLife, Prudential, General Electric Capital, and American International Group as nonbank SIFIs?    Mr. Williams. Mr. Ireland, what do you think about that?    Mr. Williams. Mr. Stanley?    Mr. Williams. Next question to you, Mr. Kupiec and Mr. Ireland, how has the nontransparent designation process for nonbank SIFIs been harmful to consumers and taxpayers?    Mr. Williams. Mr. Ireland, can you add something to that?    Mr. Williams. A final question to again Mr. Kupiec and Mr. Ireland, have these SIFI designations made the American economy safer?    Mr. Williams. Thank you for your testimony.    I yield back.
