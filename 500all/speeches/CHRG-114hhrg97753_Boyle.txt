    Mr. Boyle. Well, thank you, Madam Chair, and I really am going to refrain from an opening statement except to say two things. So I guess I am not refraining from an opening statement, in typical congressional fashion.    The first is I am very anxious to hear from this august panel. I have had the opportunity to hear from one of the members before and am familiar with the work of all three of you. That is number one. And, number two, because I might not get the opportunity later to say it, absolutely anyone would be better than Hamid Karzai, who seemed to in no way appreciate the sacrifice that the American people have gone through over the last 14 years. So, if anything, we can celebrate that we actually do have somewhat of a partner in Afghanistan to move us forward. I will yield back.    Mr. Boyle. Thank you. I just was struck by how positively received President Ghani was when he spoke here in his joint session to Congress, so it is not just the failure of the previous President, but also a positive reflection on the new President himself.    But, I wanted to just shift focus for a second. One of you talked about this in your opening statements. But the current relationship and partnership between Abdullah and President Ghani, how likely is this to be a durable alliance?    Mr. Boyle. You wanted to add, Dr. Kagan?    Mr. Boyle. So let me ask you, because you provided kind of a natural segue then, and it is touching upon something that you reference in your written testimony. To what extent in Afghanistan is our fight against the Taliban, our fight against remnants of al-Qaeda, our fight against ISIS or really just one small battle in the larger war against the caliphate?    Mr. Boyle. Which was the case with September 11 of course.    Mr. Boyle. I know I went over, and so I guess I will yield to the next person up on the other side. Thank you.    Mr. Boyle. I believe this is our opportunity to rewrite the rules.
