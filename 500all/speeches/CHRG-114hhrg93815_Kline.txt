    Mr. Kline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your courtesy in allowing me to ask the first question. Actually won't get you anything, but thanks so much, and thanks to the witnesses----    Mr. Kline. He tries, though.    Thanks to the witnesses for being here. We appreciate very much your expert testimony.    Because 1189 is my bill, the Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act, I want to dig into that a little bit.    And, Ms. Simon, I am going to go to you.    We have had very expert testimony from all of you, but I am--as you say in your testimony, quote: ``It is impossible for employers to abide by rules that do not exist.'' EEOC's lack of a clear position is what prompted my bill, so the businesses would have a clear path forward. So we are trying to get a legislative fix.    But last week the EEOC apparently recognized this problem, at least to some degree, and sent a proposed rule to OMB that will purportedly address concerns that we have been talking about today. In your opinion, what should this regulation include to address the issues that we were talking about of clarity and flexibility for employers in their employee wellness programs?    Mr. Kline. Thank you. I also am eagerly waiting to see what comes out of OMB. I would like to say I am optimistic, but we still very well may need H.R. 1189. But we will see.    So there have been some questions raised about privacy, of course, and that people don't want employers to have all of their personal information. So let's talk about HIPAA.    And, Ms. Simon, I am going to stay with you if that is all right. Under HIPAA, can an employer see the private health information of the employee or their family who participates in the wellness program?    Mr. Kline. Thank you.    I see my time is expired. I yield back.
