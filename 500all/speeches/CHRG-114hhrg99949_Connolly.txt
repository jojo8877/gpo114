    Mr. Connolly. Would my friend--are you----    Mr. Connolly. I thank my friend.    Welcome, Mr. Blinken. I wanted to just follow up on my friend, Mr. Sherman's, statement against TPP and give you an opportunity.    So let's say we pull the plug on TPP. Either the administration says we give up, you're right, it is flawed, or we in Congress decide there's no way we are going to give this our approval ever. What happens in a region to which we are pivoting and where China has its hungry eyes on trade relationships and economic ties as well?    Mr. Connolly. Just one follow-up point.

Do we have a----    Mr. Connolly. We do not have a free trade agreement with China?    Mr. Connolly. But you can't blame free trade in the case of China, since we don't have a free trade agreement. Is that not correct?    Mr. Connolly. Thank you, and thank you, Ms. Chairman.
