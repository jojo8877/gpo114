    Mr. Webster. Thank you, Madam Chair. I ride the Metro every day, for 5\1/2\ years, since I've been in Congress. I go from Pentagon City to L'Enfant to Capitol South. And I, you know, I think there's two things here. And we're talking about more money, maybe saving, hiring people, firing people, doing all that. But all I know is that every day I ride, there's an escalator broken. So I started watching three escalators. There's a bunch of them that I ride on, but this is three.    And I would say that over the past few years, that these three that I've watched have been rebuilt four times. I mean, I'm talking about all new everything. All the treads. All the bearings and all of that. And it just seems to me like there'd be a more efficient way to do that. If we save money then we certainly can do more maintenance in the right place. I would tell you you ought to look, and I don't know if there's any reports or anything about that.    But all I can tell you is, I know, because I've seen it. On the other end, there's one escalator that was, is privately done. And in the 5\1/2\ years I've been riding that one, on that same system where you get dropped off, and then this one is done by the people that own the building. It's been broken once in 5\1/2\ years.    So I think there's probably--I don't know what you do as far as efficiency and as far as rechecking the people that do your maintenance and so forth. But if the other maintenance--I've never been in a, in a wreck or anything like that, so I don't know anything about the cars. I see them. You know, they may be, you may have extra ones. You may change them out all the time. I don't know that. What I do know is, the escalators are fixed. They're there, and you got to have them repaired time and time again.    And it just seems to me like, and I don't know if it's done by an independent contractor or by your employees or whether it's the, maybe it's the vendor that provides the actual treads and so forth on the escalator. But I would tell you I believe there's lots of savings to be found there, either by getting a different vendor or different employees or different, a different person that actually performs the work, if it's an independent contractor. So that's my two cents. That's only from my experience on it.    I don't live here. I have one real system in my district. It's owned by Disney World. And I've never seen it broken in the 30-some years they've been there. And we have a lot of people that ride that too. We have 66 million people that come by my district every, every year. And they go one place, Walt Disney World. And also Sea World, Universal Studios. But the one rail system there seems to be much more maintained. So I would suggest maybe just talking to those who own or operate rail systems. Maybe there's some savings there too. With that, Madam Chair, I yield back.
