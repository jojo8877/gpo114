    Mr. Babin. Thank you.    I now recognize the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Beyer.    Mr. Babin. Thank you.    I now recognize myself for five minutes.    Secretary Schedler.    Mr. Babin. By the way, I just spent two days in Baton Rouge, and my heart goes out to you----    Mr. Babin. --and your State.    Mr. Babin. Right.    Mr. Babin. Unbelievable. I represent the 36th District in Texas right across the Sabine so--and we had--in March we had----    Mr. Babin. Absolutely. But I've never seen anything like that.    Mr. Babin. Absolutely.    Mr. Babin. In a population center like that.    But I'd like to ask you a question. You stated in your testimony that ``I'm happy to report there's no evidence that ballot manipulation has ever occurred in the United States as a result of the cyber attack.'' And, Dr. Wallach on the other hand states that ``If our paperless electronic voting systems were attacked, we'd be unlikely to see evidence of it in the voting machines or tally systems.''    So I just want to hear both of your opinions on this matter. I'm not trying to start----    Mr. Babin. --any problem.    Mr. Babin. Yes.    Mr. Babin. Okay.    Mr. Babin. Yes.    Mr. Babin. You bet. Thank you. Thank you. And, Mr.--Dr. Wallach?    Mr. Babin. Thank you.    Mr. Babin. I agree with that. I sure do. Thank you. Thank you very much.    The next question would be for you, Dr. Wallach. Is it possible for someone to conduct a cyber attack in case of voting or election systems while pretending to be Russian, Chinese, North Korean hackers so as to falsely assign blame for the hack on a foreign nation? And have you ever come across any instance of such in your experience?    Mr. Babin. Yes.    Mr. Babin. Okay. And then, Secretary Schedler, one more for you. Considering the range of vulnerabilities--and this follows up on what you said just a second ago--the range of vulnerabilities that exist for electronic systems, do you think that more States will eventually return to paper ballots? And if so, can you explain to us how paper is the more secure option?    Mr. Babin. Right.    Mr. Babin. Yes.    Mr. Babin. That's a good answer. Thank you. And I know I'm out of time, but, Dr. Wallach, just as short as you can, what do you consider the chances with many States going back to the paper ballots?    Mr. Babin. Right.    Mr. Babin. Okay. All right. Thank you.    Let's see. I recognize the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Lipinski.    Mr. Babin. Yes, sir, thank you.    I now recognize the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Hultgren.    Mr. Babin. Yes, sir. Thank you.    I now recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Weber.    Mr. Babin. Mr. Babin. Thank you. I appreciate that.    I want to thank the witnesses for their testimony and the members for your questions. And the record will remain open for two weeks for additional written comments and written questions from members.    And with that, this hearing is adjourned. Thank you.
