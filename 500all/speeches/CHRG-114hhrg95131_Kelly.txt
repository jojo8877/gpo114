    Ms. Kelly. I don't really have a question, but just to say that I represent a family who had a textile business, Flamingo Knitting Mills, and was seized in 1959 in Havana. So the issue of normalizing relations is quite personal to this family as it is to so many families in America. And even, you know, okay, they get a lump-sum payment, but even if they got the property back, the property is something else now, so what would they do with it? They can't kick--they wouldn't kick people out, or you know, it still wouldn't be the same from before.    Ms. Kelly. I yield back.
