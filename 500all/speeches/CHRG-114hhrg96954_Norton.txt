    Ms. Norton. I will remember that, Mr. Chairman.    There's concern in the District of Columbia because the D.C. Council passed a law, it allows driver's licenses. There have been some reports in the papers about ICE's use of DMV data to initiate removal proceedings against immigrants. I would have some concerns. And I'm wondering if you can tell me whether DMV databases are being used for removal purposes.    Ms. Norton. You do have access, though, to these databases?    Ms. Norton. So you have to be granted them by the jurisdiction?    Ms. Norton. And if they wanted to refuse them, they could?    Ms. Norton. That's very important to clarify.    Mr. Chairman, I have here and would like to ask be entered into the record the briefs filed in Texas v. The United States. There are 15 States plus the District of Columbia that have filed briefs in this case that say that there would be improvement in their own economies. And I ask that these briefs be entered into the record.    Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
