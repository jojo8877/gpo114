    Mr. Connolly. Would my friend yield?    Mr. Connolly. I thank my friend from Illinois.    Just if I could build on that, Mr. King, how well do you think the Department is implementing FITARA, which is of great concern to this committee?    Mr. Connolly. And how are you doing on data center consolidation, perhaps one of the most immediate big cost-savers if done correctly?    Mr. Connolly. Dr. Harris ----    Mr. King.--on the technical side of that.    Mr. Connolly. Mr. Harris?    Mr. Connolly. Well, remember, one of the explicit goals is consolidation of those data centers. We don't want a huge, you know, plethora of data centers if we can help it. How are you coming on that?    Mr. Connolly. We look forward to seeing that progress. Thank you. And I thank my colleague from Illinois.
