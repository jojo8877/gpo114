    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank all of you for being here today. I appreciate the strong commitment of Chairman Mac Thornberry on acquisition reform and his persistence. As chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, my greatest concern has been and will be getting the newest and most effective technology to the warfighter to protect against cyberattacks. Do you believe that our current construct allows for this? And how do you believe rapid acquisition might play a role in achieving this goal? And also does this promote public-private cooperation?    Mr. Wilson. And I appreciate the efforts of Secretary Ash Carter to visit Silicon Valley, to meet with leaders of IT as to what can be done to facilitate, again, the most effective and up-to-date capabilities. And for each of you, could you give us an example of the best practice that the Department of Defense acquisition community should be following to improve how they start programs? And can you name a program where they--have actually been used in practice? Beginning with Ms. Fox.    Mr. Wilson. Thank you.    Mr. Wilson. Thank you very much.    The Chairman. Ms. Bordallo.
