    Ms. Norton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    I must say, Mr. Starr, it must be difficult today to be a diplomat abroad in light of what we're seeing. After the Paris attacks, I wonder if there are specific changes that the State Department feels are necessary in light of those attacks.    Ms. Norton. All Americans, did you say?    Ms. Norton. Mr. Starr, you probably get it coming both ways. There were recent reports in the press that some diplomats feel hampered in their diplomatic activity because of the kinds of security that you apparently have had to place on them.    Have you had such complaints? And have you considered how diplomacy, which has to be done everywhere, is or can be carried on in light of diplomats who are hellbent on doing what they came to do but the Department may feel that there are dangers if they proceed? How do you reconcile the dangers with people feeling that they're not always able to do their job?    Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to say, I think perhaps Benghazi, more than Paris, may have taught about eager democrats trying to go to places that aren't safe. Perhaps one learned more from Benghazi than even from Paris.    So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
