    Mr. Yoho. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen.    I want to start with a quote from John Kerry in the Washington Post. It says,        ``If Iran's nuclear program is truly peaceful it is not         a hard proposition to prove. The only reasonable         conclusion for its stonewalling of international         investigators is that Tehran does not--does indeed have         much to hide.''    And then President Eisenhower back in the late '50s, early '60s said Atoms for Peace program, one lesson is clear--civilian nuclear programs flourish only through cooperation and openness. Secrecy and isolation are typically signs of a nuclear weapons program.    And I think it is very evident that they have been very--not willing to be forthright and allow the inspectors in there, and then my question is this. Without the sanctions, in your opinion would Iran have weapons now or eventually? Yes, all three of you real quick.    Mr. Yoho. Are we all in agreement with that?    Mr. Yoho. Okay. I just--I need a quick answer here.    Mr. Yoho. Mr. Duelfer? All right. With the sanctions in place, in your opinion would Iran have nuclear weapons eventually?    Mr. Yoho. I have sat here for 2 years and I have heard experts like you--not saying you--saying that Iran was 6 months to 1 year from having enough fissile material for five to six weapons. So with the sanctions in place we have already moved to this direction.    And then my last question for this is with the U.S.-Iranian nuclear agreement will Iran have nuclear weapons eventually?    Mr. Yoho. But we know the sanctions--we know the sanctions go away in 5 to 10 to 15 years because I have heard all kinds of numbers. How about you, Mr. Rademaker?    Mr. Yoho. Mr. Duelfer, what is your----    Mr. Yoho. And the point I want to bring out here, if we had no sanctions they would have one. If we had sanctions and they had been working here why else would you have the secret--all the secrecy that they have done, all the development that they have done?    They have moved in this direction and the experts again have told me they are going to have them, and then with this agreement we are pretty much saying you can have one in 10 to 15 years. And what I don't hear is why are we not preparing for the day that they have one.    We are spending and wasting time trying to prevent that which we can't instead of preparing that which will be and I think the American people and our national security would be better served if our focus was on the day that Iran has a nuclear weapon and talk about the responsibility of a nation that has nuclear weapons.    I mean, I can't think of a more rogue nation than North Korea and I think our focus in time should be spent for that day because they are going to get it. And I would hope they don't but, again, I see them getting that and, you know, the whole idea--and Mr. Zeldin brought this up--of the snap back. I think that is a joke because if I were to ask you to take us through a snap back process when that times comes, when you look at what Iran has done over the course of the last 30 years--lie, deceit, deception--we know that snap back is going to have to be put in place.    How long of a process would that be to say all right, you have broken the--you have violated the agreement. How long of a process would that be for snap backs to go in place to stop their development?    Mr. Yoho. I mean, we are talking months if not years to even say all right, they broke that.    Mr. Yoho. With the sanctions already in place you got continued illicit procurement. China, the UAE, Turkey are supplying with stuff they are not even supposed to be buying. So to think that they are going to abide by an agreement I think is a joke and that our nation would be better served to prepare for that day and change our policy in that direction.    I yield back and I thank you for your time.
