    Mr. Donovan. No, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much.    Mr. Donovan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am the newest member of this committee. I have been in Congress for 4 months. I don't want you to get confused. This is my first time sitting on the upper tier. I am usually down there by where it says ``staff only.'' So this is my first exposure----    Mr. Donovan. Thank you, Chairman.    This is my first exposure to your expertise to the probing questions of my colleagues. My understanding of the issue is just what I have read over the years. So my limited understanding and it is more general is that the problem is caused by droughts, it is caused by having adequate water but it is not safe water, there is safe water that is adequate for people but there is not infrastructure to get it to people. It is regimes or governments who have adequate water and infrastructure but won't allow their people access to it.    Are these the problems that you are facing, that these countries that you are talking about are facing, and is our country doing its share or enough to help? To anyone.    Mr. Donovan. Thank you.    Mr. Donovan. I thank you all for your enlightenment.    I yield the rest of my time, Chairman.
