    Mr. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Lombardi, now the focus of this hearing is on experimentation, agility, and ultimately delivering combat capability to our men and women in the field. With that in mind and for over six decades, the Air Force's Big Safari program has been an extraordinarily successful, agile organization, and it has in the past been a go-to organization when capability was needed in a short amount of time.    Yet it appears over the last few years that that sort of agility has come under some stress, and Big Safari is operating more like the mainstream organizations rather than trying to leverage and replicate that agility into those organizations. As one example, we understand that the contracting function has been moved out from under their organization, just as it has been across the rest of the Air Force. It would seem to many that aligning all elements of program execution under a single entity would make more sense.    Looking back on what made this program successful, isn't the Big Safari program a model for some of the acquisition reform that we clearly need and are looking for now, and is this an acquisition culture model that we need to fully protect and to foster?    Mr. Lombardi.    Mr. Turner. I would appreciate that because, obviously, if you look at its success, we don't want to diminish that success as we might look to it as a model.    Mr. Turner. Thank you.    The Chairman. Mr. O'Rourke.
