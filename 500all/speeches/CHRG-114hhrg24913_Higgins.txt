    Mr. Higgins. No, we have not.    Mr. Higgins. Mr. Chairman, I can confirm that CIA participated in the classification review process, and I'd be happy to talk about that process in closed session. Needless to say, some of the materials do include classified information that we do not believe is appropriate for public release.    Mr. Higgins. Mr. Chairman, I'd prefer to discuss any further matters relating to classification in closed session.    Mr. Higgins. Sir, I'd prefer to answer any questions about the classification review in a closed setting.    Mr. Higgins. I'd prefer to answer any questions about the classification review in a closed setting.    Mr. Higgins. Sir, I'd prefer in a closed session to answer any questions about the classification review.    Mr. Higgins. Again, sir, I'd prefer to answer those questions----    Mr. Higgins. Yes, sir.    Mr. Higgins. The SCIF is a sensitive compartmented information facility.    Mr. Higgins. It is a secure facility in which one can handle sensitive compartmented information.    Mr. Higgins. There are rules for handling classified information. I wouldn't want to misstate those rules. But as a general principle, compartmented material should be stored in a     Mr. Higgins. Unless you have a SCIF in your home, generally no.    Mr. Higgins. Yes.    Mr. Higgins. That's correct.    Mr. Higgins. That's correct.    Mr. Higgins. That is correct.    Mr. Higgins. I would hope not.    Mr. Higgins. I'm sure that people do on occasion accidentally bring electronic devices in. There's protocol for them reporting that to your security officers and removing it from the building as soon as you discover that you have it.    Mr. Higgins. Yeah. I have no immediate personal knowledge, but I'd assume that there are such cases.    Mr. Higgins. To assess whether there were any consequences of a SCIF, for example, of having been unlocked, or an electronic device having been brought into a SCIF.    Mr. Higgins. Potentially exposed one way or another.    Mr. Higgins. Sir, I'd prefer not to speculate or answer a hypothetical. It's a case-by-case basis depending on the----    Mr. Higgins. If people fail to follow security protocols, there are consequences ranging from a conversation with a security officer to administrative action and up from there.    Mr. Higgins. Depending--again, it all very much depends on the facts of the case at hand.    Mr. Higgins. If information is classified, it should be marked as classified, both portion markings and headers and footers on the beginning and end of the document. But the lack of a classification marking does not mean that the material in question is not necessarily classified.    Mr. Higgins. Yes, one could.    Mr. Higgins. When classified information is reduced to writing or put on an electronic system, it should be put on a system that is appropriately secure for that level of classification.    Mr. Higgins. I can think of one occasion on which I have accidentally removed material from a SCIF, realized it immediately, and returned to the SCIF with that material.    Mr. Higgins. No.    Mr. Higgins. Yes.    Mr. Higgins. I will admit, I do not remember every classification marking on each of the emails that were released pursuant to the FOIA request.    Mr. Higgins. I will take your word for it. I don't have the FOIA manual in front of me, I'm afraid.    Mr. Higgins. Sir, I wouldn't want to speculate without knowing what information we are discussing, and I'd prefer to----    Mr. Higgins. Again, it would all depend on the information in question, and I'd prefer to discuss the classification review and any classified material in a closed setting.    Mr. Higgins. If information relating to CIA sources of methods were disclosed to a foreign adversary, yes, that could have adverse consequences.    Mr. Higgins. It can be, yes.    Mr. Higgins. It would all depend on those few sentences.    Mr. Higgins. Potentially, yes.    Mr. Higgins. Sir, I think that is well outside my realm at----    Mr. Higgins. I believe people with access to classified information treat that responsibility seriously, yes.    Mr. Higgins. I said I believe people with access to classified information treat that responsibility seriously, yes.    Mr. Higgins. I do.    Mr. Higgins. I would defer to the chairman.    Mr. Higgins. Again, sir, I am here and ready to answer classified----    Mr. Higgins. --in a closed situation
