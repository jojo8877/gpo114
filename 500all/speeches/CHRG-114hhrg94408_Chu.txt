    Ms. Chu. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    First I'd like to enter into the record statements from the Copyright Alliance and Creative Future<greek-l>B1 deg. on their support for a strong copyright system. I'd also like to enter a statement from Sound Exchange<greek-l>B2 deg. into the record.    Ms. Chu. Thank you.    Ms. Chu. Thank you for that.    I'd also like to ask a question about the small claims process that could be an alternative to Federal court. I hear from so many small business owners, and the general consensus is that going to Federal court is very, very costly. And that is why I believe we must establish a small claims court for creators that need it the most.    Can you discuss how a system could be established and how it will function alongside the Federal court system?    Ms. Chu. Thank you.    I yield back.
