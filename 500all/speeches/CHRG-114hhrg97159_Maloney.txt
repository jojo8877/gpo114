    Mrs. Maloney. Thank you very much.    Chair Matz, I speak to my credit unions all the time. And, quite frankly, they have never raised transparency of the budget. Is this a really big issue with the credit unions, the     Mrs. Maloney. Okay. Despite the very significant and substantial revisions to your risk-based capital rule, the credit union industry continues to express concerns that some of the risk weights assigned to credit unions will unnecessarily require them to hold additional capital and will ultimately restrain their ability to lend as much as they would like. So my question is, how do the risk weights under your revised proposal for credit unions compare to similar risk weights for banks?    Mrs. Maloney. Do you think credit unions should be the same as banks?    Mrs. Maloney. Okay. And I have heard a whole disparity of opinions on your third-party vendor proposal. The GAO and the FSOC support your position for enhanced authority. But the credit unions make the argument that it is not necessary and would lead to increases in regulatory burden in your budget. Can you tell me, what are gaps in your regulatory authority, and whether it would increase your budget?    Mrs. Maloney. Okay. That is a consideration.    I am also aware of legislation that is pending that would require NCUA to hold budget hearings before your budget has actually come out. But I understand that you are a peer leader in transparency. Can you describe the information you make available?    Mrs. Maloney. And can you explain how your supplemental capital proposal could work with the revised risk-based capital rule when finally implemented?    Mrs. Maloney. And, finally, in your written statement you mentioned your support for H.R. 1188, bipartisan legislation that would permit more small business lending by credit unions. Can you describe how that would help credit unions across the country?    Mrs. Maloney. What is the cap?    Mrs. Maloney. My time has expired. Thank you.
