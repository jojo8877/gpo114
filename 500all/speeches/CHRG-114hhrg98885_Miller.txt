    Mr. Miller. Thank you very much.    I am wondering why you feel like the need for flexibility--and I understand for rapid acquisitions. In fact, Mr. Lombardi, you talked about flexible funding, and then, Mr. Stackley and General Williamson, you both have referred to it. There probably was a reason at some point that Congress kind of stovepiped the money in the way it comes to you. Any idea what that reason was?    Mr. Miller. I think most of us recognize that there is a need to take the risk, and I think we are willing to do that. I think the issue is between risk and waste, and that is where the biggest problem, I think--but is it that difficult to go through the reprogramming process here in Congress, or is it difficult at DOD to go through the reprogramming?
