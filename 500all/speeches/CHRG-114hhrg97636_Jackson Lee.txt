    Ms. Jackson Lee. Let me thank the chairman for his kindness and the ranking member of this committee in this important hearing.    And I thank Secretary Bond for your presence here today. I dashed from the floor so thank you for your patience.    But I want to just hold up a face of mothers that have encountered challenges and difficulties even as this law has been passed.    And I would like to be--I think all of us would like to be a help to the administration, to administrations plural and to these families.    So I, first, would like to get from you a sense of the importance of the law being enforced through judicial and law enforcement education.    It seems that there is a difficulty. One case comes to mind where the court said I don't have jurisdiction--I am going to give it to Monaco when the children are U.S.-born, the mother is U.S.-born and a court is advocating their responsibility.    What do you think we can do with the education about the enforcement of this law?    Ambassador Bond. Well, one very valuable important tool that we have in terms of our education efforts is our network of Hague judges, Federal and state judges who are experts on the Hague and are prepared and very actively go out and talk to their counterparts in other countries in order to address very directly the questions that they might have about how this process works and to reassure them about how the process works in the United States.    So that is one of the education measures that we have. We also have brought scores of foreign judges and prosecutors to the United States to be--to have the opportunity to meet their counterparts and to understand how the process works here and to exchange different cases they worked on and just talk, you know, robe to robe, if you will, about how the process works for them, how they understand it and how the American judges handle the same cases.    So I think that is very much at the heart of the work that we are doing working also with the Hague permanent bureau, which has experts stationed in different regions of the world who also work to support different governments to make sure that they understand what they are supposed to be doing and that they get it right.    In Brazil next week there is going to be a judicial training program that is being organized with our support by the Hague permanent bureau.    Ms. Jackson Lee. I am on the Judiciary Committee and I think the education is a problem and I think also it might be helpful if the Justice Department joined in with the State Department as it relates to the judicial enforcement.    Again, that is part of what you see in the understanding. I guess my concern is that the Goldman Act has not been as strongly enforced as the intention was behind the passage.    How do you--do you think a collaborating with the Justice Department on the enforcement end or would be--would be helpful?    Ambassador Bond. Congresswoman, we actually do collaborate very closely with the Department of Justice. We work very closely with the FBI on--especially in blocking abductions of children from the United States but also in addressing different cases, and Justice is very much involved in the work that we are doing, the interagency work, on preventing the abductions and also on working to effect returns.    So I absolutely think that greater coordination with Justice is a good idea. We have--twice a year we have a specific interagency meeting which includes the Department of Defense.    It includes Justice, DHS and others--State, of course, because we lead it--to talk about what more we can be doing as a government to address this issue and to prevent the abductions but also to address the situations of the families that are already caught up in this.    Ms. Jackson Lee. And you can imagine that is very painful and I think we can only judge ourselves by the numbers of children that get reunited legitimately or legally with those parents who found themselves in an international quagmire and they just--whether they have lawyers here they are just grounded by this huge umbrella of international affairs that can really be insurmountable for must an individual who lives in Iowa, an individual who lives in New Jersey or Houston or in the state of Texas--just insurmountable.    So let me--let me ask this. In those meetings the FBI independently is there with the DOJ? Is that the--is that the enforcement arm--the FBI?    Ambassador Bond. Yes, FBI is also there.    Ms. Jackson Lee. Then can you--I think the question would be, and we have the greatest respect for the mountain of responsibilities our law enforcement have and we thank them all for their service--but we wonder whether or not there is an educational issue there and what do you, the State Department--who is the overseer, if you will, of the success stories?    How much--how much enforcement is the FBI engaged in? Are these cases high priority cases? Can we determine how many cases in the law enforcement term have been made by the FBI using the law and do we need now to assess that part of it, the enforcement, that then brings these cases before the court?    Ambassador Bond. Well, we work, as an example, very closely with the FBI and local law enforcement when we are notified by a parent that that person believes that there may be an abduction in progress.    We have 24/7 operators who are--they are not operators, they are officers who are trained in abductions who are available to take calls if people call in and say I just came home, my wife is not here, she left a note, I think she is planning to fly out with the kids.    Our officers are able to give very immediate direct instructions to the parents. If they don't have a court order they need one and they are told exactly what to do and we hook up with CBP, with the FBI, with local law enforcement in order to act--to interdict that abduction. So that is an example of a process that works very well.    You spoke, and it is absolutely true, to the challenge to the average citizen of understanding, you know, what do I do now if my child has been abducted to a foreign country that I may not even know that country very well and that is why we have a team of officers working in our Office of Children's Issues, the prevention team but also the abductions team that they are a part of, to provide information to the families that are caught up in this nightmare and to make sure that we're well linked up with the central authority in the other country if it's a Hague partner and to follow up on the case and provide the advice and the guidance that we can for non-convention cases to help people identify a lawyer in the other country and understand what their options are.    Ms. Jackson Lee. Let me add--and I appreciate that but let me add and hopefully I am being helpful to this committee of requesting that we get a list of the cases--active cases that the DOJ and working with this international law enforcement are acting upon now.    Ms. Jackson Lee. It is interesting, as the chairman has taken the lead, the ranking member--I am on Judiciary and Homeland Security, two of the departments that you mentioned--so I think there is an opportunity for a partnership here but to get the list of cases, active cases and then the second would be the list of cases that have resulted in the extradition or the return of these children because the most instances is children.  Written Response Received from the Honorable Michele Thoren Bond to  Question Asked During the Hearing by the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee    We do not have access to a comprehensive list of IPCA cases involving the extradition of the taking parent or return of the children as a result of criminal charges against the taking parent. The following are illustrative cases that we are aware of that fit these criteria; however, we would refer you to the Department of Justice for more comprehensive information:        <bullet>  Mexico, 2016--One child was returned to the United         States under the Hague Abduction Convention after the child's         aunt obtained guardianship following the taking parent's         alleged murder of the child's mother and the child's abduction         to Mexico. Subsequently, Mexican officials arrested the taking         parent for U.S.-based murder charges.        <bullet>  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2015--Two children were         returned to the United States after Saudi authorities acted on         an Interpol Red Notice against the taking parent for         international parental kidnapping charges.        <bullet>  Ghana, 2014--Two children were returned to the United         States per a Ghanaian court order. German authorities         subsequently arrested the taking parent on state custodial         interference charges and the taking parent was extradited to         the United States. The taking parent's travel to Germany was         unrelated to the abduction case.        <bullet>  Spain, 2013--One child was returned to the United         States per a Spanish court order after the taking parent was         arrested on federal international parental kidnapping charges.         Subsequently, the taking parent was extradited to the United         States.    Ms. Jackson Lee. I think the intent of the Goldman Law was to stop the bleeding. We were just amazed at how many cases--how many families had experienced this and with their own domestic-based lawyers--some may have international experience--they just were going up against really the firewall of sovereignty.    And we were trying to find a way to pierce that and give some hope to individuals. Stories that we've had before this committee--I have had the privilege of sitting in on this committee--were ones where the family wound up in a domestic court in California, for example, and then completely obliterated in terms of that case, giving up jurisdiction.    I don't know how--I am just baffled, as I conclude, how a local court ignores the citizenship of the children, which are U.S. children, and they send them overseas. I am just completely baffled--with no showing of a parent that is not able to provide for them here in the United States.    So then when they are taken we would like at least the Goldman Law to step in and give some equality, some equal playing field. So it would be very helpful.    I think what we need to do is to really hear from all the agencies--the State Department is certainly working but you are collaborating with the Department of Justice, Homeland Security, to a certain extent some of the local law enforcement to understand that the law is in place and the law can be useful to save some of these individuals, which I would like to see.    So if we could get both of those numbers it may be helpful to this committee and the chairman and then we might be able to again look at our other agencies and how they can be--how they can be helpful in collaborating to bring some of these children home.    And I don't know, as I close--Secretary Bond, do you have any recent examples of success--whether you call it Case A or B--do you have an example of the reuniting of children that have been abducted, brought home to the United States?    Ambassador Bond. Oh, absolutely. There--in terms of what you were speaking to just a moment ago about the interagency work including the FBI, a lot of that is focused on prevention.    Discussions of what more we might be able to do to inform parents who may be at risk for this sort of thing to make sure they know what steps they need to take to protect their children and also to ensure that there is a coordinated response if we get an indication that there is an abduction underway.    That is a lot of that focus from the FBI and law enforcement and other--and other parts of the interagency working together. But there have been several hundred return.    There are also--of course, we don't know how many cases where children were protected from abduction because of advice that their parents got by calling into our team or by reading the information that is on our Web site so that they would be aware of the fact, for example, that you can--you can register with passport services, the fact that even though we require for all minors both parents have to agree to the issuance of a passport, you can take the additional step of saying I want you to contact me personally if any application for my child is filed because I want to be sure that my spouse doesn't, you know, pretend to have a notarized document from me that is false. So we have that program and we have other programs that are available for people to ensure that their children are protected or flagged so that they won't be the victims of an abduction.    But, of course, that doesn't help in every case.    We have plenty of cases where the child travelled with both parents' knowledge and agreement because one parent didn't know what the other parent was planning. So----    Ms. Jackson Lee. And that is where the abduction comes in, and that is the problems that we would like to solve. So, again, let me add a third request.    If you have to protect the privacy but if a report could--we could find a list that is either listed by number or something that says, you know, we returned this person from Kosovo to the United States.    But I would like to see the list, to see that myself. Is it over a period of years or it is in the last year or----    Ambassador Bond. We submit an annual report----    Ms. Jackson Lee. Right, under the law.    Ambassador Bond . And it does include the statistics on the returns by country.    Ms. Jackson Lee. And the most recent annual report was when? Was it----    Ambassador Bond. It was issued in April.    Ms. Jackson Lee. In April. If you are about to give to your other annual but I would like to--I would just like to ask for that report. I know it comes to Congress but I would like to----    Ambassador Bond. We will make sure you get it.    Ms. Jackson Lee . Ask for it and if there is an updating between now and then I would appreciate that as well. Mr. Chairman, I could pursue a whole line of questioning but I would like to yield back. Thank you.    Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you very much, Ms. Secretary.
