    Mr. Cooper. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I, too, welcome the witnesses, and it is a pleasure to work with you on these issues of vital importance to our national security. As you noted, no weapons are more important or more dangerous than these, and we need to make sure that we are doing the best we possibly can to keep them safe, secure, and reliable. I look forward to the testimony of the witnesses.    Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Continuing the chairman's theme, let us talk about the WIPP disaster. Hundreds of millions of dollars to remediate, a year or more of delays, ripple throughout the entire nuclear establishment. Who has been held accountable in the WIPP disaster?    Mr. Cooper. So some time in the calendar year of 2016 we will see a resumption?    Mr. Cooper. Well, that is the timeline. How much, though, is it estimated to cost?    Mr. Cooper. And this will all be overseen by Ms. Roberson and the Defense Nuclear Safety Board?    Mr. Cooper. So back to Mr. Whitney. If the price tag is between $70 million and $300 million, how much is the contractor going to be held responsible for?    Mr. Cooper. So, then, that will be publicly available, that information?    Mr. Cooper. General Klotz, you seem to be doing a good job running an alphabet soup of an agency. There are many challenges, but as Chairman Rogers said, if anybody can do it, you are supposed to be the man. We appreciate when you bring in projects on time and under budget. That is great. I know you have a lot on your plate, both with life extension programs and with construction projects.    So we on this committee want to help you with the full range of your responsibilities, including your nonproliferation duties and the management of change that you made to include counterterrorism in that, that you are assured that that will give us better ability to deter anyone who might be thinking of a nuclear incident in this country and better opportunity to not only prevent that from happening, but to identify the wrongdoers and take prompt action to protect the American people.    General Klotz. Yes, sir. The change that we made was, in a sense, how we view the problem of dealing with nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism, both at home and abroad in a very, very general sense.    You mentioned alphabet soup. Up until we made this change, we had a lot of different programs that were created in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, and the work that we did there under the Nunn-Lugar initiatives and other Cooperative Threat Reduction activities. And a couple of years ago, Ms. Harrington, who is sitting behind me, started an over-the-horizon look at positioning our efforts in this area for the longer term to deal with an increasingly complex and increasingly dangerous world.    Our thought in approaching this is that we should think of this issue from start to finish, from cradle to grave as a continuum of activities that run from protect against the spread of special nuclear materials that would fall in the hands of would be proliferators and terrorists; and then if that fails, be able to counter that, and then if that fails, be able to respond to any nuclear radiological incident.    So it is a continuum of activities. In fact, just yesterday we released the first-ever comprehensive report on the full range of activities that fall within this particular mission space. So we see that as a compendium, as a companion volume to the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, which we produced for some number of years now that describes in detail what we do in the area of weapons activities.    Mr. Cooper. May I suggest that your duties in this regard are the single-most important function of government, and the only thing the public will care about if there were to be a nuclear incident. And I think most of the so-called experts predicted that there would be one within 10 years of 9/11, and thank God that hasn't happened, but as the clock ticks, we have to be increasingly vigilant. So we need to make sure that you are doing everything possible, and that we are doing everything possible to make sure this never happens in this country.    If you need anything, anything, call on us. And I know that all of your budget categories are going up, at least if the President's request is adhered to. And I could not agree with you more that we need to get rid of sequestration, but this has got to be job one for the country.    I see that Admiral Richardson is behind you. I don't want to stop my questioning without noting that Naval Reactors over many years seems to have done an exceptional job of keeping up with its duties, so I hope that your fine example will spread. If you do have dirty laundry, at least you have kept it more hid than the other services. I hope it is just a lack of dirty laundry. But, you know, the tradition that Naval Reactors seems to have had is a truly remarkable one, so I hope you can continue that.    I have no more questions at this time, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will just withhold until the classified session.    Mr. Cooper. General Klotz, what are the long-term goals and challenges for DNN, and what initiatives are you leading that will ensure we are well-postured to address the proliferation threats that might emerge in a decade? Are there opportunities to further improve and invest in verification and detection technology?    General Klotz. Because of its world leadership in scientific and technical expertise and programmatic capabilities in the nuclear security arena, DOE, mostly through the NNSA, plays a central U.S. Government role in pursuing U.S. nuclear security goals. NNSA makes full use of all the resources at its disposal to fulfill its nonproliferation and counterterrorism missions by:    <bullet>  Developing and implementing policy and technical solutions to eliminate proliferation-sensitive materials and limit or prevent the spread of materials, technology, and expertise related to nuclear and radiological weapons and programs around the world.    <bullet>  Providing expertise, practical tools, and technically informed policy recommendations required to advance U.S. nuclear counterterrorism and counterproliferation objectives.    <bullet>  Maintaining essential components of the U.S. capability to respond to nuclear or radiological crises and manage the consequences (domestically or internationally) of civilian radiation exposure resulting from a nuclear or radiological incident, especially those involving terrorism.    To pursue these U.S. nuclear security goals within this enduring and evolving nuclear threat environment, the NNSA program strategy is to organize its nuclear nonproliferation and counterterrorism actions into three primary areas that cover the nuclear threat spectrum:    <bullet>  Prevent non-state actors and additional countries from developing nuclear weapons or acquiring weapons-usable nuclear materials, equipment, technology, and expertise; and prevent non-state actors from acquiring radiological materials for a radiological threat device.    <bullet>  Counter the efforts of both proliferant states and non-state actors to steal, acquire, develop, disseminate, transport, or deliver the materials, expertise, or components necessary for a nuclear or radiological threat device or the devices themselves.    <bullet>  Respond to nuclear or radiological terrorist acts, or accidental/unintentional incidents, by searching for and rendering safe threat devices, components, and/or radiological and nuclear materials, and by conducting consequence management actions following an event to save lives, protect property and the environment, and enable the provision of emergency services.    Mr. Cooper. General Klotz, how does DOE plan to afford the $30 billion or more that will be required to construct and operate MOX? Should NNSA re-baseline the MOX project in FY16?    General Klotz. The Administration remains firmly committed to disposing of surplus weapon-grade plutonium. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, directed that construction on the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MOX) project continue and that cost studies and technology alternative studies be conducted. The Department of Energy requested Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research and development center, to assess and validate the analysis of options for disposing of 34 metric tons of weapon-grade plutonium mandated by Congress. The assessment and validation is expected to be completed in late FY 2015. This independent validation will inform the final policy decision on what disposition path the United States Government will adopt in compliance with the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement. Once a final decision is made, a rebaseline of the MOX project would be required and could take approximately 18-24 months to complete.    Mr. Cooper. General Klotz, is it worth an effort to assess whether it would be feasible to use low enriched uranium (LEU) (instead of highly enriched uranium) in naval reactor fuel to the next generation of aircraft carriers?    General Klotz. It is feasible but is not practical or cost effective with our current technology. Today, using LEU would increase the amount of refuelings required, which has the follow-on effect of requiring additional ships to meet the same military requirements. Theoretically, advances in technology could partially recover the loss in core-life from that which we have today in our HEU cores, but we would need a significant R&D effort to develop those technologies. Further effort would then be required to design the LEU reactor plant and other associated systems before we would be ready to build an LEU powered ship.    Mr. Cooper. Would there be any benefit to assessing the potential for LEU in naval fuel, such as nonproliferation or security benefits even if there might not be any driving military benefits?    General Klotz. If we could develop the technology to the point where we use exclusively LEU, it would ultimately have a non-proliferation benefit because we would no longer require HEU for naval nuclear propulsion.    Security costs would also be reduced, as HEU facilities have greater requirements, but we would still require a substantial security presence in terms of physical infrastructure and manpower.    Mr. Cooper. Would this help sustain the necessary R&D funding and capability for Naval Reactors?    General Klotz. Developing the technologies required to use LEU in our plants would be a substantial, multi-year research effort that works at the cutting edge of nuclear science. Advanced fuel development would sustain one area of unique expertise that the Naval Reactors Program relies upon to deal with the day-to-day issues involved in naval reactor design, construction, operation, and disposal, which require a detailed understanding of naval fuel. Naval fuel performance knowledge is unique and exists only within the Naval Reactor Program. Advanced fuel development attracts talent and maintains our knowledge base.                                 ______
