    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, gentlemen, for being here.    I want to ask one question. I think it was you, Mr. Brainard, who said that there are only a handful of really bad administrative-level people, a lot of others have left, but you said there is only a handful. Is that 10, is that 12, is that 5?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. I think I better pay better attention to your organizational chart because I am really kind of confused where people are located on it, and I will do that.    Dr. Livingston ----    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Now, in your transcribed interview with committee staff you stated the following about Administrator Neffenger, ``I give him all due credit for being probably one of the smartest people in DHS, and he is the right guy to lead TSA.'' Is that accurate?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. You said that? Thank you.    Mrs. Watson Coleman. You also stated in your transcribed interview, and again ``Now, Pete Neffenger has stood up publicly and said this is what we need to do, but he is the only voice.'' Why is Admiral Neffenger the right guy to lead TSA, and what has Administrator Neffenger actually said that needs to be done at the TSA?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. You also stated in your transcribed interview, ``Here's the thing. The workforce is waiting out Mr. Neffenger because they think the elections are coming.''    Having worked in State government at various levels, I know what it is for people to wait for leadership to come in and then wait for leadership to come out, and they say we were here when you got here; we are going to be here when you leave. So are you speaking of those individuals that have some kind of an--and I am going to use this as a generalized term--civil service protection that can't be moved that are representing the most difficult element to deal with and to work with?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Do you ----    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Do you think you could share with me some of the things you think need to be institutionalized under Mr. Neffenger's leadership that would help this agency as it may transition into new leadership under a new administration?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. I yield back my time.    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you, sir.
