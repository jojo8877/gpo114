    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Saldana, Mr. Walker asked you earlier about the recidivism rate for aliens who were previously apprehended, subsequently released, and who have committed a new crime. You said you do not have those numbers available?    Mr. Carter. All right. Can you provide this committee with those numbers please?    Mr. Carter. Okay. Mr. Chairman, will you note that those numbers will be provided to us?    Mr. Carter. Thank you. Thank you.    Mr. Roth, in your report, you found that ICE field officers said they might not have access to an individual's criminal history or their country of origin. Is this correct?    Mr. Carter. So what happens when an ICE field agent doesn't have this history?    Mr. Carter. Do other ICE officials have this, that information?    Mr. Carter. Why would the field officers not have that information but some of the other officers may have it?    Mr. Carter. Ms. Saldana, why would some of the ICE field officers not have access to some of this information?    Mr. Carter. So we just depend on them to give it to us? We don't demand that they give it to us?    Mr. Carter. I understand. But how can we expect the ICE field agents to apply prosecutorial discretion without access to those records? That's a lot to expect out of them, don't you think?    Mr. Carter. What if the information is not available? What do we do then?    Mr. Carter. Do we, so we ask the illegal aliens, we ask their country for their criminal records?    Mr. Carter. But we don't always get it?    Mr. Carter. And if we don't get it, then we're just--we can't--we can't use discretion. I mean, I really--you know, we want to do everything we can to give our field agents the opportunity to perform their work and to do their duty. Yet, if we can't get the information, I don't know how we're going to do that. Would you agree? I mean, that's a real problem.    Mr. Carter. What can we do? Tell us what we can do to help you.    Mr. Carter. Okay.    Mr. Chairman, that's all I have today. Thank you. I yield back.
