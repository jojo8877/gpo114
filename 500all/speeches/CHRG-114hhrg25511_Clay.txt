    Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank the witnesses for being here.    The FDIC is not subject to annual congressional appropriations process. Instead, the FDIC receives its funding from, quote, ``premiums that banks and thrift institutions pay for deposit insurance coverage and from earnings on investments in U.S. Treasury securities.''    Some of my Republican colleagues have proposed legislation that would subject all financial regulators to congressional appropriations, including the FDIC.    Professor Johnson, what risk to the financial system do you foresee if the FDIC were to be placed at the whim of congressional appropriations?    Mr. Clay. Right.    Mr. Clay. So if all financial regulators were subject to the appropriations process like, for instance, the CFPB, what kind of results do you think we would get from that?    Mr. Clay. It certainly did. And Chairman Gruenberg, how are the FDIC's annual expenditures approved?    Mr. Clay. By your board. And how does the FDIC ensure it does not overspend in its activities?    Mr. Clay. And isn't it true that even without being subject to the appropriations process, Congress still maintains meaningful oversight of the FDIC's operations. Is that correct?    Mr. Clay. Kind of like this hearing today, and we're in the Oversight Committee, and so--and which I find it interesting because you usually come before the Financial Services Committee, and for whatever reason, you have shown up here today. But I appreciate that, Mr. Chair, and I will yield back the balance of my time.
