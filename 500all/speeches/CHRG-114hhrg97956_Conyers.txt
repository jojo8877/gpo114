    Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Welcome, Mr. Director.    Tell me, what is the Immigration Services doing to ensure that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals renewal applications are adjudicated in a timely fashion so that young people don't suffer some of the grave consequences we've heard about?    Mr. Conyers. I'm happy to hear that.    Let me turn to the subject of Haitian Family Reunification Parole. This program has the potential to help many more Haitian families, and I want you to tell me what you see as challenges involved in expanding the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program to include all of the Department of Homeland Security-approved Haitian beneficiaries and not just a small subset.    Mr. Conyers. And let me close by asking you about, with reference to Syrian refugees, since USCIS holds responsibility for conducting in-person interviews with refugee applications to determine eligibility, how can it do so in a manner that most appropriately assesses for potential threats?    Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And may I ask unanimous consent to have my statement on this subject entered into the record?    Mr. Conyers. Thank you.
