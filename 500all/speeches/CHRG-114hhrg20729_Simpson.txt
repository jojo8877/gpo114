    Mr. Simpson. The hearing will come to order. I would like to thank all the subcommittees again for their hard work on the fiscal year 2016 omnibus bill. I look forward to working with you during this busy year ahead. We just had an organizational meeting and things are moving relatively rapidly since the President's budget came out yesterday.    We are trying to get all our hearings in and try to move things up and go through regular order, and get individual bills done, which would be novel. We have not passed all of the individual appropriation bills and conference reports since 1994. It would be nice to actually get things done on time.    There are a lot of things in this world that I am uncertain about, but I am 85 percent sure of when October 1 comes. You would think we could get it done, but it is going to be a difficult year, and a more rapid year because we are obviously gone in August, and we have a couple of weeks where we are going to be out because of the party conventions in July.    I appreciate you all being willing to come first thing. I do not know if this is the first hearing in any of the subcommittees or not, but it is one of the first.    Although we just received the President's budget yesterday, we begin our oversight hearings today. The Appropriations Committee wants to move all 12 bills under regular order within the caps that are currently set in law, and finish our work on time.    We will need to maintain an aggressive schedule in order to conduct the thorough oversight that is needed to ensure that the fiscal year 2017 energy and water appropriations bill provides responsible funding to the programs within its jurisdictions.    Today's hearing is on the budget of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. We have before us Stephen Burns, the chairman of the Commission, and his fellow commissioners, Kristine Svinicki, Bill Ostendorff, and Jeff Baran.    Thank you all for being here today, and I would like to congratulate you on your leadership and the progress that has been made in recent months on the right-sizing of the NRC. I think you have done tremendous work.    I admit that initially I questioned the NRC's commitment to right-sizing. I was very troubled by the letter the NRC sent to us during last year's budget process.    While I am confident that had the NRC received a lower appropriation, you, the commissioners, would not have actually voted to adopt reductions that could risk safety and health before a more thorough review of lower priority activities was conducted, it was still disappointing to see a letter that suggested that you would.    That having been said, since then, the NRC has taken important first steps toward right-sizing. I congratulate you, and I look forward to further discussions on continuing these promising efforts.    The Commission plays an important role in ensuring that our nation can count on the clean and reliable energy that our nuclear power plants provide. The NRC must continue to assure the protection of public health and safety and provide a timely and predictable licensing process for the nuclear industry.    In addition, we must move forward on long term waste storage and the Commission must be prepared to advance new and innovative nuclear technologies.    I look forward to your thoughts on all of these issues. I would also ask the witnesses to please ensure for the hearing record that questions for the record and any supporting information requested by the subcommittee are delivered in final form to us no later than 4 weeks from the time you receive them. Members who have additional questions for the record will have until the close of business tomorrow to provide them to the subcommittee office.    With that, I would like to welcome our ranking member, Ms. Kaptur, to our first hearing of the new budget season, and yield her any time she may use for an opening statement.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Chairman Burns, you are going to give the opening statement, and others will have a few minutes if you wish to comment on the opening statement. Is that correct?    Mr. Simpson. Ok. The floor is yours.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Simpson. Others? Ms. Svinicki.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Mr. Ostendorff.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Mr. Baran.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Again, thank you all for being here. I think it is important that all of you be here before the committee because I want the committee to get a chance to know you and you to know the committee. I appreciate all of you taking the time out of what I know is a busy schedule to come here.    Ms. Kaptur.    Mr. Simpson. If the gentlelady would yield for just a second before I turn it over to Mr. Frelinghuysen. You did not ask for the $15 million in this budget request?    Mr. Simpson. I appreciate that. The reason we gave it to the NRC is because we used to do it within the Department of Energy and the Department of Energy did not take it very seriously, and so we gave it to the NRC which I think you have done a good job with. Mr. Frelinghuysen.    Mr. Simpson. No. I was just going to see if you would yield for just a second. I did want to say because it is kind of unusual that we have all of the commissioners here. When someone asks a question, if others would like to comment on it also, feel free to do so.    Mr. Simpson. We are pleased to have with us today the ranking member of the full committee, Miss Lowey of New York. I know you have a very busy schedule, so we would be happy to recognize you next.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Mr. Calvert.    Mr. Simpson. Ms. Roybal-Allard.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Mr. Fleischmann.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Mr. Fortenberry.    Mr. Simpson. The gentleman's time has expired for this round.    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Valadao.    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Let me ask a couple of questions about the budget. First, I would like to thank the Commission for the work that you have done thus far to develop the issues and issue a supplemental environmental impact statement for Yucca Mountain because the Department of Energy seems to refuse to do so.    Can you lay out for us the schedule to complete the EIS supplemental and do you have sufficient funds to complete the supplemental?    Mr. Simpson. Can you tell me what the next steps would be after the EIS supplemental and do you have sufficient funds for this next step, and if not, what additional funds would be required in 2017?    Mr. Simpson. Would that be necessary in the next year budget or how long would that take?    Mr. Simpson. Over what period of time?    Mr. Simpson. Ok. As I mentioned in my opening statement, the NRC has taken important first steps towards right-sizing. The budget requested for fiscal year 2017 is $19. 8 million below the fiscal year 2016 and projects a reduction of 90 FTEs, as we mentioned. Before we discuss the right-sizing process in greater detail, I have a couple of questions about the budget request.    Do you all agree that the budget request will not impact safety?    Mr. Simpson. Do any of you have any additional comments on the actions that you have taken as part of the budget process to ensure that safety remains a top priority?    Mr. Simpson. Ok, in your testimony, it mentions $41.1 million in savings for fiscal year 2017 has been identified as the result of the rebase lining. Does that budget request reflect any of these savings?    Mr. Simpson. I understand that we are in the middle of a lot of changes that are going on and so forth. Will you be done with that and be able to identify whether that additional $31 million in savings is a reality in savings that can be achieved by the time we do a budget or an appropriation bill? Do you think in the next three or four months?    Mr. Simpson. Donna is looking at me like: ``Two to four months. We are talking two months maybe.''    Mr. Simpson. Thank you.    Mr. Simpson. Ok.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur.    Mr. Simpson. Ok.    Mr. Simpson. Ms. Kaptur.    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Visclosky, if you would like to go ahead and ask the other question and I can wrap it up.    Mr. Simpson. A couple of questions, one, what are your estimated carry over balances at the end of this year?    Mr. Simpson. So this budget request does not assume use of any of those funds in the budget request that you currently have as carry over funds?    Mr. Simpson. Secondly, on the rule making, and frankly I would like to commend the Commissioner for choosing to modify the NRC stats for the proposal on rulemaking so that it fully reflects the direction we provided in the Omnibus. Rulemaking is significant authority under the law and the Commission should assume the responsibility of that authority early in the process as you all have mentioned you are starting to do in your testimony. Do you expect that we will receive the rule making plan no later than the March 15th deadline and that it will reflect the requirements outline of the Omnibus.    Mr. Simpson. The committee received a report in January that indicated that the Commission now has 43 proposed rules pending instead of 93. Can you please discuss what happened to change the number of the rules and do you expect the number to reduce further once the new rulemaking plan is implemented?    Mr. Simpson. Is there any challenge in not having a fifth member of the Commission or decisions being postponed because there are splits of two to two or anything like that because we do not have a fifth commissioner that has been approved?    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Ms. Kaptur do you have one other thing?    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Dr. Orr.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Do others of you have opening statements?    Mr. Simpson. Ms. Kaptur.    Mr. Simpson. Ms. Royal-Allard.    Mr. Simpson. Go for it.    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Calvert.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. First, let me ask, following up on the grid and modernization of the grid, we act as if we own the grid; we don't. The grid is privately owned by private utility companies. What is our role in helping modernize the grid? When you say ``we are partway,'' what do you mean? The private sector is partway? What is our role in helping the private sector do this? I understand there are BPA and TVA but the line that comes to my house is owned by Idaho Power.    Mr. Simpson. But, ultimately, it is up to them to install it.    Mr. Simpson. Tell me about the Grid Modernization Institute. What exactly will it do? I think you have requested $14 million for that in the budget.    Mr. Simpson. So you would do research into those arenas?    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Smith, not to leave you out of this conversation, since fossil fuel seems to be the major source of energy in this country, let me ask you a couple of questions.    Your office proposes to increase the STEP program, which seeks to realize more efficient electrical power generation from the use of a super critical fluid in the generation process. The increase would fund the initial design and construction of a pilot facility to demonstrate the use of this fluid.    Due to the more near term deployment of this technology in the fossil energy field, the STEP initiative has been managed out of your office. However, coordination efforts are still ongoing with the Office of Nuclear Energy and Solar Energy Office in EERE.    Can you update the committee on those coordination efforts and describe how they are incorporated in the long-term plan in this technology?    Mr. Simpson. John, do you have anything to say on that?    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Smith, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 directed DOE to complete a strategic review of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and to develop and submit to Congress a plan for modernization of the reserve.    What is the current status of the review, and do you expect to meet the deadline of early May?    Mr. Simpson. I know this is before the report comes out but do you anticipate there would be recommendations for fiscal year 2017 in the report, and if so, if it is the May deadline, it may be too late because we are moving with the budget as quickly as possible.    Mr. Simpson. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 established an Energy Security and Infrastructure Fund. That authorization allows appropriations' acts to direct the sale of up to $2 billion worth of oil from the reserve and to use the proceeds for the construction, maintenance, repair, and replacement of strategic petroleum reserve facilities.    The budget request does not include use of this authorization, however. The budget request includes an increase of $45 million or 21 percent for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is described as necessary to address the backlog of major maintenance activities.    Why did we not use the fund that was created to do this in the budget request?    Mr. Simpson. Somebody is calling ``bull'' on that.    That is wind energy.    Mr. Simpson. Ok.    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Kotek, I have not called you that in a long time.    Mr. Simpson. No, I have never called him worse. I just have known him for a long time. What is the general health of the Advanced Test Reactor in Idaho, and has it adequately been funded to provide maintenance and upgrades necessary for it to last, and what projects and upgrades to the ATR are still outstanding but are not proposed in this year's budget request?    Mr. Simpson. In this year's request, the Integrated Waste Management Systems account is proposed to fund two distinct activities, storage and transportation R&D and consent-based siting activities.    In previous years, the focus of the Integrated Waste Management Systems account was on a generic research and development applicable to Yucca Mountain and other waste solutions.    Does this new proposal still maintain this focus, and how much of this research and development applies specifically to Yucca Mountain and how much applies to an interim storage facility?    Mr. Simpson. So, I guess your legal counsel has made a determination of how far down that road we can go before we get the roadblock of not allowing the department to look at interim storage?    Mr. Simpson. Well, I would just add I am not opposed to that. We are going to have this type of thing regardless of what happens with Yucca Mountain. We have to face that reality at some point in time, that we need a facility, more than one facility, as a matter of fact.    Ms. Kaptur.    Mr. Simpson. I have not heard a problem here that a small modular reactor could not fix. Mr. Fortenberry.    Mr. Simpson. You will be dead.    Mr. Simpson. That is exciting. I want my home to be a place where I come and kick off my shoes and turn on a fire and read a book and do not worry about any of this stuff. And I want to dry my clothes whenever they are wet. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Simpson. Our chairman can help us with that. Thank you.    Mr. Simpson. Ms. Kaptur, do you have anything else?    Mr. Simpson. I know he is disappointed by that.    Mr. Simpson. You bet. One source of heat waste is that hamburger waiting in my office. I am going to have to reheat that. Didn't the INL just convert all their fleet to natural gas or haven't they done that? Last year your office, John, developed the GAIN Initiative to make it easier for industry to utilize the department's state of the art infrastructure in order to help commercialize advanced nuclear technologies. Can you update the committee on those efforts in the previous year and what kind of activities will be supported in 2017?    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Valadao. You were here first.    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Simpson. Sure. You have a petaflop.    Mr. Simpson. Wait one second before you ask one more question. I am still trying to understand this. Why is this a benefit? Just out of curiosity, if the filament burns out sooner, so you replace it sooner. I mean, you have reflected heat back, but big deal. It used to warm up my house, now I have got to have my electric heater running more to warm up my house because now that heat isn't going into my house with all of the lights being on. I'm curious as to what the benefit is that we reflect it back to the filament?    Mr. Simpson. Yeah.    Mr. Simpson. Well, that would be a mistake living in Florida instead of Idaho. Go ahead.    Mr. Simpson. Yes. I mean, I am not saying it is not cool.    Mr. Simpson. So it takes less electricity to light one of these light bulbs than it does a----    Mr. Simpson. Sure.    Mr. Simpson. Yeah, yeah.    Mr. Simpson. It doesn't take as much energy to cook a French fry.    Mr. Simpson. I am tempted to ask if we are even close to a perpetual motion machine, but I won't.    I am frankly inadequate to sit in a hearing with this stuff because most of it I don't understand. It is fascinating stuff and it is good to go look at and I really get excited about science just for science's sake, but it is way above my comprehension level to a large degree.    Let me ask you this, seldom do we think about the Department of Energy when somebody wants to talk about the biological sciences. Usually you think of Labor-HHS, NIH, CDC, etc. You have been included in the BRAIN Initiative, the President's BRAIN Initiative and the President's Cancer Moonshot.    Explain to me how the Department of Energy is going to be involved in what are fundamentally biological sciences here?    Mr. Simpson. Explain unsupervised machinery----    Mr. Simpson. So these are machines that can teach themselves essentially?    Mr. Simpson. A lot of the facilities that the Department has are user-friendly facilities, but are they usually paid for under work for others, a lot of the activities?    Mr. Simpson. Because it is the government solely? I mean government organization.    Mr. Simpson. Ok. Marcy.    Mr. Simpson. True.    Mr. Simpson. Flippers.    Mr. Simpson. What you are bringing up is kind of interesting because one of the great shows of all times that got me interested in this stuff was Carl Sagan's ``Cosmos,'' which kind of took it down to almost understandable level with all this stuff, and I mean, I have got it on DVD, I have got it on VHS, I have probably got it on something else that we used to use, probably on disk, or something.    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Fleischmann.    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Simpson. If there are no other questions, Dr. Orr, we have taken your whole day.    Mr. Simpson. We apologize for taking your whole day, but you guys all do exciting work. Like I say, I wish I was smart enough to ask some questions because you do really need stuff. It is fascinating to go out and see what you do and have it explained to me when I am there, even though an hour later I am kind of going now what the heck was that?    But I am glad there are smart people like you in the world that are making advances to make the world a better place for all of us. And like I say, sometimes I just want to sit down by a fire with a good book and forget about all this stuff.    Mr. Simpson. I tell my wife all the time I am glad I am not going to live too much longer because the world is changing so rapidly, I am not sure I could keep up with it.    I look at a kid going to high school today, or grade school today, what is going to change in their lifetime? How are they going to keep up with it? You know, it is fascinating stuff. I love the commercial on TV where the grandkids stop by the grandfolks' house, and they rush out to welcome them with the trays of all of their appliances, and hand it to them and say these do not work, you know. It is for the kids to fix them. That is kind of the way I am, at this these do not work anymore stage.    I appreciate all you do, and it is good to work with you, and we look forward to working with you on putting together this year's budget, so keep up the good work. Thank you for being here today.                                           Tuesday, March 15, 2016.    Mr. Simpson. I would like to call the hearing to order. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to what is the last official hearing this year of the Energy & Water Subcommittee. We saved the best for last. I would like to welcome Dr. Monica Regalbuto to her first appearance before the Subcommittee. This is the first time since March of 2011 that we have had a Senate-confirmed Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management testify before the Subcommittee. So congratulations on getting through the Senate. We look forward to your testimony today and to hearing more about your plans to lead the environmental cleanup program through its many challenges.    The purpose of today's hearing is to discuss the President's Budget Request for the Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management. That request totals $5.4 billion, a reduction of $773 million below fiscal year 2016. Instead of requesting enough funding to keep all of the cleanup sites operating, the Administration has proposed to shift spending for the cleanup of Paducah, Portsmouth, and Oak Ridge to mandatory accounts. The Department includes these mandatory funds in their budget totals, but they are not the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. Rather, this proposal to expand the authority of USEC Privatization Fund is ultimately under the purview of the authorizing committees. This budgeting gimmick allowed the Administration to push to the side the cost of these cleanup activities and use that money for some other initiative that they wanted to highlight. This is simply irresponsible and risks hundreds if not thousands of cleanup jobs. Once again it will be the work of this Subcommittee to put forth a responsible funding plan that will keep these and other programs of the Department of Energy functioning.    Please ensure that the hearing record, responses to the questions for the record, and any supporting information requested by this subcommittee are delivered in final form to us no later than 4 weeks from the time you receive them. I also ask members to submit any additional questions for the record to the subcommittee by close of business tomorrow.    With those opening comments I would like to yield to our ranking member, Ms. Kaptur, for any comments that she would like to make.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. We are looking forward to your opening testimony.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you. Ms. Kaptur    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Fleischmann.    Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Doctor. A Federal judge has set new deadlines for the Hanford Vitrification Plant requiring this utility to come online and by 2036. How will the judge's ruling impact DOE's plans at Hanford? And does your budget request support the new deadlines or are we going to expect an amended budget request once you have had a chance to fully review the judge's decision?    I notice that DOE proposed sliding milestones. I find that interesting, sliding--I am not sure if those are like sliding wedding vows or what, but ultimately, the court rejected those. What will happen if DOE is not going to meet a deadline?    And finally, EM has been operating for years without a formal performance baseline for the Waste Treatment Plant against which progress could be measured. What will be done to improve the transparency of DOE's management of the project so that we can monitor DOE's progress?Friday, late on Friday, and the Department is in the process of reviewing all the legal paperwork regarding the court order and the consent decree amendment. With that, I would be happy to come back and once they dissect all of that and the 30-day period of communication is over, I would be happy to come back and brief you specifically on the impacts of the court order decision.    With that said, the Department remains committed to initiating glass as early as 2022, and that is with the Direct Feed Law. We have requested sufficient funding to initiate operations by 2022; that includes the Low Activity Waste Facility, the balance of plant, which is all the infrastructure necessary to maintain that facility, and the Analytical Laboratory where we go and make sure that the quality of the product is good.    Regarding the issue of the project cost, because this piece was carved out of the contract, so the contract was for the whole thing and we are committed to do this on a phase approach, which is, in our opinion, a more efficient way to chunk it in pieces. As the Secretary has put in his views regarding project management, it is easier to address a smaller portion than these huge capital projects. So we are following the Secretary's lead, and in that case, we are in the process of negotiating CLIN 1, which is basically doing what I described to you, and we should be getting very close to getting a baseline for that.    Regarding the other facilities, that will be impacted by the court ruling, and we will be back to do that.    In terms of project management, as you clearly pointed out, this facility has struggled over the years, and we have done a number of things regarding these facilities. Some of them are lessons learned from others. One of the recommendations has been to get an owner's rep, and we did hire an owner's rep, which is Parsons. We are already working with them, and they are walking through this facility. We do not have to wait until a year out before commissioning to find out any surprises. So we are walking very systematically through the plant and making sure that we address anything going forward. So we are taking a lot of modifications.    There was also a GAO report regarding the tracking system of the issues that have been determined by the contractor or DOE, and we have gone back to them and made sure that the tracking system actually captures every single thing, and so that has been revamped. Also, the accountability to the contractor has been revamped, so we have put in a lot of effort in that. I think you know Kevin Smith, and I will say, in the last three years, Kevin has done a magnificent job just to make sure that that transparency is there for you and all the taxpayers to see.    Mr. Simpson. Ok. This is a huge facility, billions of dollars, many years to operate to complete. I look at the IWTU in Idaho. In comparison, very small compared to the Waste Treatment Plant. I have to tell you in all honesty, I seriously wonder if WTP will ever be able to operate given the problems that we have had at the IWTU and trying to get it operating. I look at that huge facility and wonder if this will actually ever work. What do you think?    Mr. Simpson. Ok. Let me ask you about WIPP. WIPP funding is down from last year's level, partially due to the completion of the summer recovery activities. There is also a decrease associated with lower levels of construction project funding for the two projects that must be completed. In addition, part of the operating funding will now be used to provide funds to the State of New Mexico for road improvements. DOE did not request a specific amount for these costs, but rolled them into the overall funds for WIPP, and there are discrepancies in just how much the WIPP funding will be diverted to pay for these road improvements in the agreement.    Last April, the Department of Energy recently agreed to provide the State of New Mexico $34 million in economic assistance to build roads in New Mexico as part of the settlement agreement with the State for the events that led to the closure of WIPP. Economic assistance payments were previously authorized under the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act and appropriated by Congress, but that particular spending authority expired after 15 years. Reinstating those economic assistance payments, which totaled about $20 million per year, has been a major goal of the State. Last year, the Secretary of Energy testified that WIPP would be reopened in March 2016 and resume full operation some time in 2018. The date for initial limited operations has now been pushed back to December and the Department has not released any new estimates for achieving full recovery.    Is there a possibility that reopening WIPP to limited operations could be delayed beyond December? When exactly is WIPP scheduled to be returned to pre-2014 operational levels, and can you speak to the short and long-term challenges to resuming operations? Do you anticipate challenges in permitting or demonstrating safety operations with the regulators? And talk a little bit, if you would, about the money going to economic assistance or road development or improvement in New Mexico out of the operating costs of WIPP rather than out of a special line for economic assistance.    Mr. Simpson. Why not put that in a special line when you request it for 2017? I can understand trying to find another area to fund it out of in 2016 when you are looking at trying to meet agreement with the State of New Mexico and you do not have that line item available, but if that is going to be ongoing, why not create that line item instead of putting it in the operations budget?    Mr. Simpson. Ok. Marcy.    Mr. Simpson. Back to WIPP, we like to jump back and forth and around. It has been stated that when WIPP resumes operations, it will do so slowly, and we have heard there may be as few as five shipments a week for several months or even years. At Idaho in particular, there are hundreds of canisters of waste packaged and ready to be shipped to WIPP. Which waste will go to WIPP first? And with the improvements that you have to make to your packaging procedures, do you anticipate any of the waste at Idaho or other DOE sites will need to be repackaged? How long will it be before DOE catches up on all the true waste commitments, and particularly, how soon should DOE begin shipping waste out of Idaho to get through the backlog? What is WIPP's planned timeline for returning the pre-2014 rate of shipments?    Mr. Simpson. So that is what they mean when they say partial----    Mr. Simpson. --opening?    Mr. Simpson. Again, will any of these canisters that are already packaged have to be repackaged? Do you know?    Mr. Simpson. Yeah, I have enjoyed those.    Mr. Simpson. Does the ventilation system that currently exists for partial opening, would that be sufficient to address a problem that might arise should another container decide to expand beyond its ability to hold it?    Mr. Simpson. Explode?    Mr. Simpson. We hope we didn't have the first one.    Mr. Simpson. Ok. NNSA's new proposal to start shipping plutonium to WIPP, will that take up any of the limited shipping capacity? And if it is going to be years before EM catches up on its current TRU waste commitments, how will you prioritize the plutonium shipments? And is there any capacity available for adding an entirely new waste stream to the queue at all? And what exactly has NNSA asked EM to do to support its plans for the MOX alternative?    Mr. Simpson. So you are saying that with the proposal currently by the Administration to down blend and package this stuff and ship it to WIPP, it won't delay the schedule of things that are already scheduled to go to WIPP?    Mr. Simpson. Ok. Again, what is EM? What has NNSA asked EM to do to support their plans for this MOX alternative? Have they asked anything yet?    Mr. Simpson. Have you reviewed the results of the red teams and the recommendations on the MOX alternative and do you see any issues implementing that alternative? Stanford University called on the Department of Energy to perform a new documented safety analysis, WIPP as a result of the proposed disposal of excessive plutonium at that facility. Also, articles have been published and the Secretary has recently testified that researchers at Sandia National Lab had looked further into the safety issues raised by outside groups concluded the risks were overstated. Have you looked at this?    Mr. Simpson. Right. Well, and of course, the one study came out and said the idea of WIPP is that everything does get condensed eventually.    Mr. Simpson. It gets collapsed?    Mr. Simpson. If it doesn't get condensed, how does it get collapsed.    Mr. Simpson. How can there be so much disagreement on, and I don't know how much disagreement there is, but disagreement between professional individuals as yourself and other people that have made these things that say--I mean they essentially said, listen, it is not a matter of if it goes critical, it is when it goes critical. How can they be that wrong?    Mr. Simpson. Ok. Mr. Fleischmann.    Mr. Simpson. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Simpson. The next you know she is going to tell us how good the Notre Dame football team is, right?    Mr. Simpson. Ms. Kaptur.    Mr. Simpson. I always ask this question, for the last 15 years or so. How are we progressing about moving facilities to EM that need to be moved to EM and getting them out of the laboratory part of the budget?    You know, I am smart enough to understand that the laboratory people would like to have that moved to EM and have the responsibility go to EM, but the money to stay.    My concern is, I want to know what our total responsibilities are on EM and what our reliabilities are on EM, so I want those things moved to EM that ought to be done by     Over the years, we have been trying to move that process along. How are we doing with that?    Mr. Simpson. But the budget constraints--this is paper stuff. It is money that we are spending somewhere right now. What I want to know is what is our liability in the future.    Mr. Simpson. Right.    Mr. Simpson. Ok. Then we can make a determination about where it belongs, so we know what our total liabilities are in the future. That is what we have been trying to accomplish over the last several years.    One final question for a colleague that is not here today, but I am sure I am going to be asked about it by that colleague and others.    The largest reduction in your budget request is for the Richland Site office which is reduced $206 million below last year's. Why such a steep reduction, and can DOE fulfill all of its commitments to clean up the River Corridor at this funding level? DOE recently proposed shifting some clean up milestones for Richland back in order to concentrate on a tank mission at Hanford. Has the State weighed in on these proposals?    Mr. Simpson. So, is it accurate to say you do not anticipate any layoffs at Richland based on this budget?    Mr. Simpson. Let me ask, do other members have questions? Do you have more questions? I have to leave for a meeting. My Vice Chairman is going to take over here. Thank you for being here.    I think what Mr. Visclosky said is absolutely true, you do have the toughest job in the Federal Government. Like most tough jobs, all of us that sit on the sidelines could do it better. That is the way we usually think, you know.    Mr. Simpson. We are great armchair quarterbacks. Thank you for the work you do, and we look forward to working with you.
