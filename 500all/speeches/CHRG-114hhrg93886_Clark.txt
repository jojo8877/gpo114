    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to all the panelists for being here today.    I am extremely lucky to represent the 5th District of Massachusetts, which is really a center of life sciences, biotech, and it is not only an economic engine for Massachusetts and for the country but it is also, as I--a very personal effect on the research that you do and sponsor. As I heard one dad say, a rare disease is only rare until it affects your child. And the difference is that you are making not only in jobs and the economy in Massachusetts and across this country but also in the real effect on people's lives.    And people do not come to my district for the weather. In fact, when Dr. Cordova was welcoming back my colleague from Antarctica, I thought you had mixed us up.    But I am concerned. They come to Boston because we have incredible universities and we have incredible institutions doing research. That is why they come and that is why keeping that innovation pipeline is so critical. But there is cynicism and there is criticism of much of the work that you are doing. And so I am very interested if any of you can tell me a little bit more about the STAR METRICS program and how you are proceeding in being able to put real dollars and really track the impact of the investment and research that is going forward.    Ms. Clark. Sure.    Ms. Clark. Thank you very much.    And, Dr. May, back to our historic snowfall, I wonder if you could discuss the progress around the disaster resilience framework that NIST is developing and other efforts that might be underway around disaster resilience.    Ms. Clark. Yeah.    Ms. Clark. Great. Thank you.    I see my time is expired. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
