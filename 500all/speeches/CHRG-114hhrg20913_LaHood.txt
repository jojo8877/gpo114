    Mr. LaHood. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I want to thank the witnesses for being here today and your testimony. I want to take a brief moment just to highlight the impact of the SBIR program in my home state of Illinois. The SBIR program is an important source of investment in new technology for the State of Illinois. Since the program's inception, Illinois has received over $600 million in SBIR funding, creating thousands of new jobs, new products and new services.    As others have mentioned, the recent National Academy reports on the SBIR and STTR program in the civilian agency side a very strong record of commercialization and return on investment as well as strong linkages to the university and basic R&D infrastructure within the country, which is clearly evident in the State of Illinois.    With the past successes of this program in mind, as we look to reauthorization of SBIR and STTR, what top recommendation would each of you make for improving the SBIR and STTR programs to more efficiently and effectively promote innovation and job creation? Doctor?    Mr. LaHood. Thank you.    Mr. LaHood. Thank you for that.    In terms of measuring success or the metrics used to do that under both SBIR and STTR, can you comment a little bit on how you measure success in those two programs?    Mr. LaHood. Thank you.    Mr. LaHood. Thanks.    Mr. LaHood. Thanks.    Mr. LaHood. Thank you.    Those are all my questions, Madam Chair. Thank you.    Chairwoman Comstock. Thank you.    And I now recognize Ms. Clark for 5 minutes.
