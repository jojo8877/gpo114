    Mr. Meadows. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is my honor to introduce my Governor from the great State of North Carolina. And not only does he come to us with great experience as a Governor, but having served as a mayor, as a businessman, I know full well, Governor, that you understand transportation because you have traveled from Murphy to Manteo, some 545 miles.    To put it in perspective, that is like going from Washington, DC, to Maine. And if you can put all the different roads and different avenues of transportation that you would encounter from Washington, DC, to Maine, that is similar to what we have in North Carolina.    So as a pro-growth, as a guy who is focused on jobs and knowing the importance of that connection, it is my honor to welcome you here and introduce my friend and our Governor, Governor Pat McCrory.
