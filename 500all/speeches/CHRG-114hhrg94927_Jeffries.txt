    Mr. Jeffries. I thank the chairman for yielding, as well as for Secretary Perez for your presence and your leadership.    The rule that we are discussing today was first put forth in 2010. Is that correct?    Mr. Jeffries. And then it was subsequently withdrawn. Is that right?    Mr. Jeffries. And can you walk us through sort of the substantive changes that have been made from the withdrawal to the re-institution of it?    Mr. Jeffries. Thanks. Now, there has been some discussion about ongoing engagement with the SEC.    Mr. Jeffries. Has that engagement resulted in any substantive changes that have either been adopted or are under consideration?    Mr. Jeffries. Are there any specific concerns that the SEC raised that the Department of Labor has responded to in yielding the newly proposed rule?    Mr. Jeffries. Now, is my understanding correct based on your earlier testimony that the CEO of Bank of America supports the proposed rule?    Mr. Jeffries. Lastly, as my time is expiring, Mr. Secretary, how would you define a small investor in terms of is there a threshold, is there an amount of the investment? Who are the individuals that could potentially benefit or could potentially be harmed by this approach depending on what stakeholder you are listening to?
