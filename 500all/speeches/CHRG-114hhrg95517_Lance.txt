    Mr. Lance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Certainly, this is a very important issue, and I commend your leadership on this, your leadership over many years. And among the panelists, I welcome Ms. McGee , who is from the part of New Jersey that I have the honor of representing. This is an issue that demands the attention of the full Congress of the United States.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
