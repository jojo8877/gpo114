    Ms. Sinema. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When hackers stole the credit card information of Susan, one of my constituents from Chandler, Arizona, she initially didn't notice an unauthorized $10 donation to a small charity, but the next month she did notice the several hundred dollars in police uniforms that a man in London had purchased using her card, and that is when she called the FBI.    Unfortunately, Susan's story is all too common. Last year alone, according to Verizon's 2015 Data Breach Investigations report, there were more than 79,000 security incidents reported and more than 2,000 confirmed data breaches. These breaches have exposed the personally identifiable information, as well as sensitive financial information, of millions of consumers.    Securing the financial services sector requires us to continue to strengthen security practices and information-sharing infrastructures.    Educating consumers and financial sector participants is also crucial if these efforts are to be successful.    The evolving nature of cyber threats calls for a vigorous and dynamic response. I look forward to hearing more from our witnesses today about how industry is developing safety protocols that keep pace with technological innovation, and how educating consumers and financial sector participants will help better protect consumers like my constituent, Susan.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back my time.
