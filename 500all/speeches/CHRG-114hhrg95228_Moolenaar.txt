    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I want to thank all of you for sharing your insights with the Committee. And I've learned a lot already today, so appreciate that.    Secretary Winfree, I wanted you, if you could, to elaborate a little bit. You mentioned in your testimony some of the work being done in Ann Arbor. And, as a Michigan representative, you know, I'm aware of some of the work they're doing. They've created a mobility transformation facility, and--to test how autonomous vehicles respond to real world situations. And what I was hoping you might do is just elaborate on how you work with them in this regard. And I know there are some plans to expand also through the Detroit corridor.    Mr. Moolenaar. Wonderful. Thank you. And I also wondered if you might comment on some of the policy issues for autonomous vehicles, and how the research at the universities has contributed towards, you know, clarifying some of the policy issues. And then one in particular I was hoping you might talk about is--I've heard from individuals about spectrum availability for vehicle to vehicle technology, and that the--on May 13 Secretary Fox announced plans to accelerate the rulemaking proceeding. And I don't know all the specifics of that, but I guess the core question I have is, is that going to require an additional funding request, or do you feel that funds are sufficient to accelerate that process?    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you very much. Thank you, Madam Chair.    Chairwoman Comstock. Thank you, and I now recognize Mr. Westerman.
