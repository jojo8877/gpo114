    Ms. Sanchez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The more I learn, the more confused I get. I just would mention that a few years ago I was over with the French counterpart of these two companies. And they were telling me that their launch costs about $200 million equivalent, and they said they weren't worried about UAL, but could I get rid of SpaceX because they were going to drive them out of business. So I see why we have kind of a confrontation going on here.    Mr. Bruno, I understand the reason that you have given for the use of the Russian RD-180 engine. I am one of those persons that works consistently in NATO and is very worried about what is happening with Russia, and I think that it is high time that we develop our own engine here or have it or, in the case of SpaceX, I guess we have developed it.    Somebody told me that it was going to be $1 or $2 billion additional government moneys invested into building this new engine. Is that around the right realm?    Ms. Sanchez. So the United States isn't putting very much money into developing this? Because I am being told by my staff that General Mitchell said it is about $1.5 billion that the government is investing into this engine development. I don't want to get caught up. But is that true or false?    Ms. Sanchez. So I will have to go back to General Mitchell, then, to see why he said that.    Let me go to Ms. Shotwell for a minute, and then I might come back to you, Mr. Bruno. I am just trying understand this.    I have been very interested in having competition and new entrant certification process for a long time. And I understand the major requirement for new entrant certification was that you perform three launches successfully. Am I correct about that?    Ms. Sanchez. Now, SpaceX, I believe, completed those by January 6 of last year, of 2014. Is that correct?    Ms. Sanchez. And, since then, you have completed a total of 11 more consecutive successful launches with the Falcon 9 rocket.    So is your sense that your rocket has demonstrated reliability?    Ms. Sanchez. But it is pretty much the same rocket each time?    Ms. Sanchez. Then I understand that ULA has about 14 different configurations of the vehicle.    So can you tell us, have all of these flown more than three times to demonstrate reliability? Mr. Bruno.    Ms. Sanchez. How much of each went.    Ms. Sanchez. That would be great. I would appreciate that. Okay.    For right now, that is the questions that I have. I have a lot more after everything you said, but maybe somebody else will get to them. Thank you.
