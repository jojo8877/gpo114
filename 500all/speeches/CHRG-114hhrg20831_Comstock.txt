    Mrs. Comstock. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'd like to thank our witnesses so much. It's so exciting to see your enthusiasm. And I'm thrilled that we had one of our local high schools here. I think we still have some of the students here from Oakton High School in Fairfax, and we appreciate them being here. And I wanted to ask you, even though we don't have that time travel thing that we could do, if for each of you if you could go back to being in high school and you were looking at this field and you were looking at how someone might get engaged and involved in this exciting opportunity and career that you all have had an opportunity to do, what would you tell them to do today and going forward in their educational experiences, their volunteer experiences, you know, where they can get internship opportunities and any Web sites or other resources that you might provide for the Committee that we could share with them or that you might direct them to here today if you could speak to that.    Mrs. Comstock. So is there like a package we can give to our high schools that you----    Mrs. Comstock. --all have?    Mrs. Comstock. Great.    Mrs. Comstock. Great.    Mrs. Comstock. Right. Thank you.    Mrs. Comstock. Thank you. I appreciate that passion and for the students, these are your role models that you are looking for in the science field. If they look and sound like this, grab them. Thanks.
