    Mr. Polis. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Thank you both for being here today and I want to highlight some of the contributions the Corporation for National Community Service has made in my district as an example.    As my colleagues know, Colorado declared a state of emergency in the fall of 2013 after experiencing the most damaging floods in our State's history. Many homes, businesses, roads, bridges were destroyed. There was loss of life. Thanks to CNCS, though, volunteers were immediately deployed to Colorado to help in the aftermath of our floods. And in total, over 700 National Service members came to our State. Their work involved volunteer donations, management, staffing call centers, coordination of medical mobility rides, community relations activities, meal services. I got to visit a number of them as they were working to help feed some of those who had lost their homes, and mucking and gutting and debris removal as well.    I want to thank you, first of all, for CNCS's quick response. And I was hoping you could talk a little bit more, Ms. Spencer, about the important role CNCS has when a natural disaster occurs, like ours.    Mr. Polis. Well, thank you. And it was a great opportunity to interact with that, with many of your members in the field and in so many important roles in our State. And as you indicated during your visit to our district, it was--there were tens of thousands that were temporarily homeless. Many thousands lost their homes. And really, the community came together. But truly, the help with the managing, the outpouring of support from the untrained volunteers in our community is why we needed the trained volunteer and donations management. So many people wanted to help with goods and with time, but without the structure that CNCS provided with folks on the ground, we really wouldn't have been able to take advantage of that, and I just want to thank you.
