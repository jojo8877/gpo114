    Mr. Chabot. Yes, it is very brief, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you, and I want to commend you and the ranking member for bringing all three of these bills before the committee today.    And I will speak just briefly on H. Res. 343, a bill that expresses concern, as my colleague indicated, in regards to China's state-sanctioned harvesting of organs from prisoners, particularly members of the Falun Gong and other religious and ethnic minorities. And I know I have met with many Falun Gong practitioners from my district in past years who have brought me all kinds of horrific stories about what they either experienced themselves in China or others that they know of or relatives that are still there. And it is unbelievable that this happens in the 21st century.    I brought similar legislation before this committee when I was chair, and I am pleased to see that the subcommittee is raising awareness of the issue by bringing this matter before the subcommittee again. China's organ harvesting, it is deplorable, and it is sad to me to think, again, that in 2016 this heinous practice is still occurring. China continues to deny that organs are taken from prisoners without consent, but there is still no independent verification of a state-sponsored organ transplant system. And it is our duty as the leader of the free world to continue to call on China to end this disgraceful barbarism.    And I yield back.
