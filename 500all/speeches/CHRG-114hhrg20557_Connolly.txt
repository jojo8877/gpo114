    Mr. Connolly. I thank the chair.    And I think my friend from South Carolina makes some very important points, and in listening to his questioning, I reflected on the 20 years I spent in the private sector in management. And one of the principles certainly that I think is applicable is that you have to differentiate between performers and nonperformers, people with stellar performance and people with adequate or sub-adequate performance. If you treat everybody's performance the same when it comes to recognition, you are saying to your stellar performers I can come in early and stay late, I can donate time on the weekends and it doesn't matter. I am going to be treated like Harry Houdini there who is a clock-watcher, shows up at 9:00 and leaves promptly at 5:00 and never volunteers for anything. And as far as management is concerned, we are the same.    And, Mr. Stier, I am looking at a statistic that says 73 percent of private sector workers believe management recognizes superior performance, but in the public sector, only 44 percent believes that. That tells me there is a problem if we are going to get at what Mr. Mulvaney was talking about, which is, okay, give me a time frame where we want to see this improve. Part of the solution, it seems to me, or part of the problem is this recognition-of-performance problem. Do you want to comment on that, Max?    Mr. Connolly. I remember once in the private sector working with somebody, the head of a big division, and he had a bonus pool that year, at bonus time, and he decided to give everyone a $250 bonus rather than make the tough decision of Mr. Meadows gets one because of stellar performance and Mr. Connelly doesn't because we know what. He is a Democrat.    Mr. Connolly. No, no, that is not true. But if you don't do that differentiation, you are saying to everybody, we are going to dummy down to the mean, and that is not how to get high performance, and it actually has a morale effect on the high performers because I feel unappreciated.    All right. I want to push back just a little bit, Mr. Stier, about you are saying, well, it is really about leadership more than mission. That is a little hard to believe. So, Ms. Leo, how many agencies were kind of put together to form NASA? How many agencies do you represent here?    Mr. Connolly. One. You have got a lot of missions? I mean, you go to Mars, get a man on the moon--so I was a person--space shuttle is over, I mean, are you doing oceanographic research, climate change research. I mean, have you got a lot of missions that ----    Mr. Connolly. Plethora ----    Mr. Connolly. So you have got TSA, you have got Customs?    Mr. Connolly. You have got Border Control?    Mr. Connolly. You have got Secret Service?    Mr. Connolly. What else did you get? You got 22 agencies when you were formed?    Mr. Connolly. So that is a world of difference than sort of the cohesive mission that helps provide an organizing principle for NASA.    Mr. Connolly. Would that be fair?    Mr. Connolly. How many employees you got?    Mr. Connolly. And how many have you got, Ms. Leo?    Mr. Connolly. A quarter of a million almost, 17,000.    Well, I am going to accuse my friend Max Stier of oversimplifying. I think DHS has a much more difficult task from day one. That is not to let anyone off the hook, but many orders of magnitude different than NASA's wonderful success. And good for you. I would bet you Ms. Bailey is sitting there thinking I wish I had Ms. Leo's problems because trying to bring all this together in one happy family when it--and I was in the private sector, and we were a contractor to the administration trying to figure out this new thing called the Department of Homeland Security. I remember looking at the org charts and trying to figure out, well, what would go where and who would go where and what is the logic of it? And sometimes there was logic and sometimes there wasn't. So trying to cohere all of that and infuse it with mission and morale and productivity is a challenge. And, Max, you want to redeem yourself a little bit?    Mr. Connolly. And then I will ----    Mr. Connolly. We are not the Senate.    Mr. Connolly. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the IRS, Mr. Stier, because, presumably, if your agency were called before Congress on real and bogus allegations for dozens of times, if over $1 billion of your budget was slashed, if people couldn't fill vacancies even through attrition because of those cutbacks, if your technology was getting more and more ancient every day and you have, you know, hard drive collapses and all kinds of problems integrating systems and so forth, and you couldn't even meet customer satisfaction standards because of inadequate resources, presumably, that might have an impact on your morale and your productivity every day and your job satisfaction if you worked for that agency. Fair enough?    Mr. Connolly. I have got to go vote.    Mr. Connolly. But there can't just be one point of view about IRS around here, and as long as I am here, there won't be.
