    Dr. Fleming. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Lombardi, I have a question for you, sir. I was interested to learn about the example you gave in your testimony regarding the communications and situational awareness systems developed by Air Force's S&T Program at the request of 20th Air Force and Global Strike Command. Could you please describe that particular effort and what was learned from it?    Dr. Fleming. So this situational awareness technology would be the ability to talk and to text----    Dr. Fleming . Ground to air--air to ground and throughout the battle sphere, and it would seem that a lot of that is off the shelf. It may have to be adapted. Would that be the case?    Dr. Fleming. Right. How long was the prototyping process, and is there anything in your view that would have helped speed up that process?    Dr. Fleming. Okay. Thank you.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Dr. Wenstrup.
