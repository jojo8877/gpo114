    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Secretary Burwell, for not only your testimony today but the incredible work that you are doing. I especially want to highlight your commitment to addressing the opioid crisis, coming from a State like Massachusetts where it has just been a devastating effect, we so appreciate your partnership and your commitment.    I specifically want to ask you about adolescents and young adults. I have spoken with many experts who treat this population. They have been clear that this population needs special protocols to be able to tailor the treatment to their unique social and biological needs. They are also clear there has not been enough emphasis on programming or research in this area.    Can you discuss any efforts that are underway to target action towards young adults and adolescents, and if you see this as an important area for fighting the opioid crisis?    Ms. Clark. And one we would love to work with you on. I want to quickly get back to Zika. You spoke about some startling numbers, even here in the United States. Every day we are seeing more of the connection being verified by research about the connection and danger for pregnant women. We are also seeing countries around the globe that have very restricted access to family planning for women saying do not become pregnant at this time.    Can you elaborate on what is being done both here at home and abroad to make sure that women have access to a full range of health care options?    Ms. Clark. Great. Thank you.
