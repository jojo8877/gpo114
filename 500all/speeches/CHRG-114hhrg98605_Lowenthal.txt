    Mr. Lowenthal. I concur. First, I thank you for being here. You know, and I also want to extend my condolences to the families of all those that were killed and injured by the earthquake. I want to congratulate the people of Taiwan on the successful elections.    It is a welcome example of democracy in a region that at the same time has seen a great backsliding on human rights. That is not true in terms of Taiwan.    We have seen the gradual improvement in the relationships between the cross-Strait relations.    I think it is beneficial for the security of all to have that stability and I look forward to the hearing today. Thank you, and I yield back.
