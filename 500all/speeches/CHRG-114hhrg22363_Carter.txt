    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank all of you for being here.    Ms. Seymour, I would like to start with you. It's my understanding that OPM's legacy system, that you are currently using COBOL, a system that was developed originally in 1959, is that correct?    Mr. Carter. Okay. According to my research and my staff research, it was originally developed in 1959. And that's the system that we are using?    Mr. Carter. Ms. Archuleta, OPM since 2008 has spent $577 million on IT. Is that correct?    Mr. Carter. You think that's pretty close?    Mr. Carter. But would you say that's in the ballpark, $577 million? I mean, give or take a couple hundred million, what are we talking about?    Mr. Carter. $577 million dollars since 2008, yet we are still using a legacy system that was developed in 1959?    Mr. Carter. It's my understanding that approximately 80 percent of our IT budget is being spent on legacy systems. Is that correct?    Mr. Carter. I am sorry, I am just flabbergasted by this. It's just mind-boggling that we can spend--first of all, we can spend $577 million; secondly, that we are spending 80 percent of what we have budgeted on legacy systems. I mean, it's just amazing to me that we're doing that.    Nevertheless, Ms. Seymour, let me ask you, the IG's flash audit indicated that the estimated cost for just two phases, only two phases of your infrastructure improvement project, is going to be $93 million. Is that correct?    Mr. Carter. $93 million?    Mr. Carter. I am sorry, I don't mean to be dramatic, but $93 million?    Mr. Carter. The one that was originally developed in 1959?    Mr. Carter. If any of it was developed.    Mr. Carter. Okay. Okay. Well, it's my understanding that despite the decades that we have been spending all this money, these millions of dollars, that we are still using paper forms in some cases? Is that true?    Mr. Carter. We have spent $577 million on IT since 2008, and we are still using paper forms. Of course, hey, paper forms may be better in this case. I mean, at least we have still got control of those.    Mr. Carter. Does it include paper forms? Does it include paper forms? Will we still have paper forms after you make these adjustments?    Mr. Carter. I can't help but wonder if that's not a move in the wrong direction. At least we can have some control over these paper forms. We obviously don't have control over the computers and the information that we have on the Internet.    Mr. Carter. So we leave paper around?    Mr. Carter. Ms. Seymour, I agree with every point you are making here. My point is that we spent $577 million since 2008, and we are still using paper.    Mr. Carter. And that includes that $577 million that we have already spent?    Mr. Carter. This is going to be more money we are going to throw at this problem, right?
