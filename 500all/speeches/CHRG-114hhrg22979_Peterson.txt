    Mr. Peterson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, everybody, to today's Agriculture Committee hearing.    As the Chairman said, today's hearing is focused on recruitment challenges and scholarship opportunities at 1890 land-grant universities. We are also going to be learning more about legislation sponsored by Congressman David Scott, H.R. 6020, to make more scholarships available to students attending these schools. Our land-grant universities play an important role in agricultural research, extension, and educational programs, and I am looking forward to hearing today's testimony.    I want to welcome the 1890 Presidents who are joining us today and some of whom were here last summer when we met to recognize the 125th anniversary of the Second Morrill Act.    Before I yield back, Mr. Chairman, this is our final hearing of this Congress, hopefully.    The Chairman. Yes.    Mr. Peterson. And I believe that we have held more than 80 hearings, which is a record. As we wrap up here, I want to just thank all the Members for their hard work and the Chairman for his leadership and service to the Committee. And, with that, I yield back.    The Chairman. Well, I thank the Ranking Member for those kind comments at the end. We have had a great 114th Congress and most of us are looking forward to a great 115th Congress. We may have a few folks that move on to committees of lesser importance throughout the Congress as we move forward, but it has been a great pleasure.    So, with that, the chair will request other Members submit their opening statements for the record, so the witnesses may begin their testimony and to assure there is ample time for questions.    I would like to welcome our first panel, the Honorable David Scott, Member of Congress from Georgia, Member of the Committee; the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver, Member of Congress from Missouri; and the Honorable Kevin Cramer, the only Member of Congress from North Dakota.    Congressman Scott, begin when you are ready, sir.    Mr. David Scott of Georgia. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I want to thank you, Chairman Conaway, for your dedication and for your understanding, and for your longtime support of the 1890s African American colleges and universities. Thank you so much for this hearing.    I also want to thank Speaker Paul Ryan, who was very helpful to us in getting this moving.    And I certainly want to thank our Ranking Member Peterson for the great job he has done over the years. He has been a champion of the 1890s.    I want to thank my cosponsors too, if I may, Mr. Chairman. Representative Kevin Cramer, my dear good friend. We have been on this journey now for a couple of years in getting this bill moving and our bill to provide training and job training for African American young men as we move to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure. I want to thank Ms. Marcia L. Fudge, our former Chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, who has been a stalwart supporter of our African American schools; Brad Ashford from Nebraska, who is a great sponsor; Mrs. Mia Love, another one of our Republican cosponsors; Ms. Gwen Graham; Ms. Alma S. Adams; Mr. Pete Sessions, who is the Chairman of our Rules Committee; and my good friend Reverend Emanuel Cleaver, who is an extraordinary champion. Thank you all for this. We appreciate it.    Thank you for your staff work on this, Mr. Chairman, your staff, and my hardworking staff of Ashley and the team back in my office.    This is a monumental moment in the history of our African American colleges and universities, ladies and gentlemen. We humbly come before this Committee to plead our case that we establish the grants in this bill that will enable the African American land-grant universities to be able to provide $1 million each year for scholarships for our African American students. The caveat is that the African American students will then commit to careers in this burgeoning field of business agriculture. The most important industry in the world is agriculture. It is the food we eat. It is the clothes we wear. It is our energy. It is high finance. It is derivatives. It is risk management. It is commodities and futures trading abroad, which makes just the derivatives sector a $800 trillion piece of the world's economy. And we want this opportunity for our students.    I want to say one other thing. There was a great conversation that was held by two great Americans. One, President Abraham Lincoln; the other, General Robert E. Lee. The Civil War had ended. And they had this conversation right on these hallowed grounds. And as they looked over the expanse and looked south to Virginia, Mr. Lincoln said to General Lee, ``It is not incumbent for us to complete this task,'' and before he could finish that, General Lee finished that sentence by saying, ``But, Mr. President Lincoln, neither are we free to desist from doing all we possibly can.''    That is what is at our place today. And, Mr. Chairman, I want us to have this opportunity. There is no greater need in the African American community, as in all communities, than economics, jobs, financial security, and the education and job training that goes along with them. That is why all of us sponsors have sponsored a companion bill to provide job training targeted for the 18-39, the hardest hit group, to help build the crumbling infrastructure. That sits in another committee, but today this is the education piece.    And, Mr. Chairman, this also gives us an opportunity. I received some notice that President-elect Donald Trump is interested in what we are doing with these two bills. I want us to have an opportunity, give us this opportunity, because in these two bills it is the Secretary of Labor that will be the supervisory agency for the jobs bill, but this bill will come under the new Secretary of Agriculture. It is important that we engage them.    And I take President Trump, and as many of you know or some of you may not know, he and I finished from the great Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania together. I ask for an opportunity to allow us to work, and maybe we bring some of that Wharton School of Business magic to this. I appreciate the opportunity to do that and hope you will pass this bill out. Thank you.    H.R. 6020, Funding for Student Scholarships for the 1890s Land-Grant              African-American Colleges and Universities Act                                          H.R. 6021, Jobs, On-the-Job `Earn While You Learn' Training, and            Apprenticeships for African-American Young Men Act                                                 The Chairman. The gentleman yields back.    Reverend Cleaver.
