    Mr. HARDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I just happen to be a small business owner myself, or at least I used to be. And Mr. Williamson made the statement, Mr. Lewis, just a few minutes ago, the fact that people, businesses want to pay their taxes. And I agree. As a small business person, I want to pay my taxes. Would you agree the reason we want to pay our taxes is because we have to have a good, sound foundation to make sure we are profitable in paying taxes in order to receive revenue from banks?    Mr. HARDY. I believe there are a number of things that are causing small businesses to fail, but in 2012, 64 percent of all employees working were working for small businesses. Today, we have the lowest number of small businesses in the last three decades or further. Is it because of our tax regulations? Do you think it is a combination of a number of things? Anybody care to address that?    Mr. HARDY. Some months ago we had a hearing here and they discussed other tax causes to small businesses, and once you grow just even your business a little bit, the average, I think it was, about $1.2 to $1.5 million per year for people to get their taxes done once they reach a certain threshold. Have you seen that, Mr. Williamson, on your avenues? That is just to prepare it to get it to you folks.    Mr. HARDY. The 1099 form, Mr. Mankowski, why does the 1099 requires so much for small businesses, is such a burden? Can you go into a little deeper process of what your discussion was there?    Mr. HARDY. Okay. Let me ask one last question.    Mr. Vitale, as far as the IRS, can you elaborate how they can and should be providing us better security for small businesses and all businesses in their businesses to make sure we are protecting that security of those tax returns?
