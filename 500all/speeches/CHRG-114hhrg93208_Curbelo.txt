    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity to discuss what is a topic that is increasingly on the minds of parents and students and teachers.    I wanted to delve further into the issue with penalties related to FERPA violations. Mr. Reidenberg mentioned that we should perhaps consider developing a graduated penalty system. Could you go into that, expound what would something like that look like and how could it be most effective?    Mr. Curbelo. Now, I also heard a conversation about expanding FERPA to cover third-party vendors--    Mr. Curbelo. And a question for Ms. Sevier.    It is obvious that these types of breaches occur every day. Obviously, most of them do not rise to the level where they would get attention from the media. But how much do parents know about these beaches? Do you get the sense that schools are open and transparent about data breaches, or is there a lot that parents and even we don't even know?    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you.    Ms. Knox, I think you wanted to weigh in?    Mr. Curbelo. Please.    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you all very much.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is expired.
