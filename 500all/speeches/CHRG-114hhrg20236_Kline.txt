    Mr. Kline. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank the witnesses for being here today for your testimony.    I must say, Ms. Jeffrey, listening to your testimony, there are a lot of concerns that you raised and one of them was repeated staff did not, staff did not, staff did not, did not recognize, they didn't take action, they could have, they did not. And that makes me worry about what the culture and the leadership might be and that would be back into Ms. Spencer's box. But I want to come specifically back to you, Ms. Jeffrey, the inspector general, because you talked about some steps that have been taken and could be taken, you hope will be taken. But you also in your testimony highlight the structural challenges to better oversight at the corporation. Can you discuss why these structural challenges pose an issue in whether the corporation can properly oversee the program under its charge, structural?    Mr. Kline. It sounds daunting to say the least. It's going to take time. It's going to take real leadership. Is it going to take reorganizing, creation, eliminating some departments and creating new ones? Obviously, you've created a new one when you hired a chief risk management officer. Are there other organizational things that the IG has recommended?    Mr. Kline. It is like an indictment of a lot of people in an oversight role and a management role. I suppose we have to include ourselves in the oversight business. We will be taking a close and continuous look as we go forward because the problems, to listening to the IG, are extensive. I yield back, Madam Chair.    Chairwoman Foxx. Chairman yields back. Mr. Scott, I recognize you for 5 minutes.
