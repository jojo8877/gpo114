    Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. And I thank all the witnesses for your testimony. And I have--I'm not sure if I can get to my questions because some other ideas came to mind as you're talking here. So let me ask a couple things here so I better understand. I know States--everyone does it differently, and the idea of not having our--the machines directly connected to the Internet makes sense.    But, for example, if you do have a voting machine, you're voting, usually then at the end of the day when the votes are--polls closed, votes are tabulated, how are those votes then communicated then from the polling place? So--because I would expect that they are done oftentimes over some sort of connection to the 'net.    And then the other part of that is I go online election night and I'm looking at the results coming in so I can go online and connect in at least to see the results that they're displaying. So hopefully, I'm not displaying too much lack of understanding here, but aren't there some connections there to the Internet that are going on?    Mr. Lipinski. Well, that's good to hear. Is this--is that the common way it's done everywhere?    Mr. Lipinski. And I think that--hopefully, that helps alleviate a lot of concerns that people do have that you--it's not being transmitted electronically in the way that can be hacked into.    One other question that I had, the paper tapes I think are--certainly, I agree--a great idea. How often, though, and at what point would there be a check of those against the electronic numbers?    Mr. Lipinski. I am from Chicago, though.    Mr. Lipinski. Similar.    Mr. Lipinski. We have a big lake to do that.    Thank you very much. I yield back.
