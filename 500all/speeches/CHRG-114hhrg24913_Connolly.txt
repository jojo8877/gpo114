    Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    First of all, Mr. Chairman, there's an article that appeared today in Newsweek on emails, in Newsweek magazine, and I would ask that the article be entered into the record.    Mr. Connolly. Now, let me just read a little bit from this article. It says, ``Clinton's email habits look positively transparent when compared with the subpoena-dodging, email-hiding, private-server-using George W. Bush administration. Between 2003 and 2009, the Bush White House lost 22 million emails.'' Twenty-two million. ``This correspondence included millions of emails written during the darkest period of America's recent history when the Bush administration was ginning up support for what turned out to be a disastrous war in Iraq with false claims that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction, and later, when it was firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons. Like Clinton, the Bush White House used a private email server. It was owned by the Republican National Committee. And the Bush administration failed to store its emails, as required by law, and then refused to comply with a Congressional subpoena seeking some of those emails.'' I guess the past is prolonged.    The chairman mentioned that Abraham Lincoln was a member of this committee. Abraham Lincoln--maybe that wasn't auspicious, Mr. Chairman, because he only served one term and couldn't get elected back home. He was a Whig at the time. And he spent his time worried about things like the Wilmot Proviso, trying to end the slave traffic in Washington, D.C., the Nation's capital, and fighting the slavocracy and trying to move this country to limit and ultimately abolish a very evil institution. That's what he spent his time doing.    We're spending our time trying to pillory somebody about how she managed/handled her emails, while she was traveling the world on behalf of this country to 111 countries trying to restore the U.S. Credibility and foreign policy after the incredible damage done in 8 years of the previous administration. I guess if I were in my friend's situation, I'd grasp at this straw too.    Mr. Herring, my friend Mr. Jordan tried to suggest that you, the FBI, have handled this case very differently than the normal course of justice to an American citizen. I guess because of the high profile nature, you handled it very carefully. Is that correct?    Mr. Herring. Yes, it is. And----    Mr. Connolly. So it was different in that sense. But we had Director Comey, who was a, by the way, registered Republican until very recently, we had him before our committee. And I asked him under oath: Did the witness involved, the primary witness here involving these emails, did she lie? No. Did she deceive? No. Did she evade? No. Did she obfuscate? No. Did she deliberately keep or withhold relevant information requested from the FBI? No. Is that your understanding as well?    Mr. Herring. I would defer to Director Comey's comments.    Mr. Connolly. Mr. Mica says, or somebody said, you know, the case is closed. And you affirm that?    Mr. Herring. Yes.    Mr. Connolly. Why? Why is the case closed? What's your understanding of that, Mr. Herring?    Mr. Herring. Decision made at the highest level.    Mr. Connolly. And the decision was, according, you said you read the newspapers, the director of the FBI says it wasn't even a close call. Is that your understanding?    Mr. Herring. Correct. Yes.    Mr. Connolly. Correct. No special treatment here. It wasn't even a close call. This is political theatre.    302s. Could you tell us what 302s are? My friend Mr. Gowdy knows what they are, but not all of us do. We're not all lawyers.    Mr. Herring. So 302 for us is a term of art. It's simply a form that which we summarize an interview.    Mr. Connolly. And how often do you provide 302s to Congress?    Mr. Herring. Rarely.    Mr. Connolly. Rarely? Why?    Mr. Herring. Usually, we don't share the investigative files outside of----    Mr. Connolly. So our request is unusual. Is that correct? You said you don't do it very often.    Mr. Herring. Correct. Yes. In some sense it is. We don't get that request very often and we certainly don't provide them very often.    Mr. Connolly. And to protect people----    Mr. Herring. Yes, sir.    Mr. Connolly. --from raw interviews. Is that correct?    Mr. Herring. From----    Mr. Connolly. Or the summaries of those interviews.    Mr. Herring. To protect people from--I'm sorry. I missed the----    Mr. Connolly. From raw material from an interview.    Mr. Herring. Certainly.    Mr. Connolly. Right. Redactions. How unusual are redactions? This is unique to this case. Is that correct?    Mr. Herring. No, no. We do redactions from time to time.    Mr. Connolly. Why?    Mr. Herring. Really as far as, you know, people do have privacy interests. Anytime we release documents outside of the FBI, if it's in FOIA, if it's another avenue, have to review those and apply----    Mr. Connolly. If the chairman will indulge me one more question, and then I'll cease and desist.    Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Herring, were you told at any time before this hearing or at any other time during this process that this is highly political and you should cover up, obfuscate, evade, deceive, or not provide information to protect somebody from our scrutiny?    Mr. Herring. No, not at all.    Mr. Connolly. Has anybody at this table----    Mr. Connolly. I appreciate the chairman's indulgence.    Mr. Connolly. Aye.    The Clerk. Mr. Connolly votes yes.    Mr. Cartwright?
