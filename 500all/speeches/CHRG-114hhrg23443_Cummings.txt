    Mr. Cummings. Thank you very much.    Mr. Sopko, first of all, welcome back. It is good to see you again.    One of the largest infrastructure projects in Afghanistan was the new Ministry of Defense headquarters, which has been dubbed a mini-Pentagon. This project cost about $200 million with a significant portion of that coming from U.S. taxpayers. In your report you say this project took almost 5 years longer to complete than anticipated and cost more than three times the original estimate. You found that one of the key reasons for this delay was security issues. In fact, there were multiple reports of suicide bomb attacks at or near the site during construction, is that correct?    Mr. Cummings. You indicated that the headquarters building is well-built but it has some issues that need to be assessed relating to its ability to withstand earthquakes. At the time of your report, you were still waiting for documents to close out these recommendations. Has the DOD provided you with the information you need to close out those recommendations?    Mr. Cummings. And do you have any idea when you might get them?    Mr. Cummings. Have you been pressing them for them?    Mr. Cummings. Why would you be suspicious?    Mr. Cummings. Yes, we are very familiar with that concept.    Mr. Cummings. You also noted that as of January 7, 2016, the building was not fully occupied. Is that right?    Mr. Cummings. Do you know if it is fully occupied now?    Mr. Cummings. It is?    Mr. Cummings. Ninety percent? As of when?    Mr. Cummings. Thank you.    So let me turn to Mr. Brown. The project was managed by the Air Force Civil Engineer Center. Mr. Brown, how did the security situation in Afghanistan impact the budget and construction costs of the headquarters building?    Mr. Cummings. Whoa, whoa, whoa, the President moving around cost you 10 months? Is that what you just said?    Mr. Cummings. What?    Mr. Cummings. All right.    Mr. Cummings. Had that been anticipated?    Mr. Cummings. Okay.    Mr. Cummings. So what were some of the other factors that led to the delays and increased costs?    Mr. Cummings. So are you confident in the structural integrity of the building and its ability to withstand earthquake and terrorist attacks?    Mr. Cummings. Ms. Abizaid, this facility has cutting-edge communications security equipment, including security cameras, key cards access, computers, and x-ray scanners. How will these features improve operations and security for the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces?    Mr. Cummings. Do you believe investing in projects like the new headquarters furthers our national security goals, and if so, explain that.    Mr. Cummings. Thank you very much. I yield back.    Mr. Cummings. Great.    Mr. Cummings. Just a few questions. Speaking of training, Ms. Abizaid, some of the construction projects have been constructed as training facilities, is that right?    Mr. Cummings. And they were to house the Afghan National Police and the Afghan National Army. Are the Afghan soldiers and police being trained in the facilities that were constructed with U.S. dollars?    Mr. Cummings. I mean, and how is that going? Is it adequate for what they are trying to accomplish?    Mr. Cummings. Do you know?    Mr. Cummings. Now, Mr. Sopko, one of the facilities that you inspected was the Qala-i-Muslim medical clinic in Kabul Province?    Mr. Cummings. Which was built with funds from the Commander's Emergency Response Program. Your report concluded that the clinic was serving the community well, is that correct?    Mr. Cummings. And why did you say that?    Mr. Cummings. So, in fact, you found that in 2013 clinic records that showed over 1,500 outpatient consultations, 63 prenatal patients, and 63 newborn deliveries since the clinic opened in 2011, is that right?    Mr. Cummings. And you also found that the Ministry of Public health was sustaining the facility and inspectors noted clean floors, well-kept bedding, working heating and electrical systems and a well-stocked pharmacy. Would you call this a success story?    Mr. Cummings. And that is one of the exceptions, I take it?    Mr. Cummings. Just listening to today.    Mr. Cummings. Are there are a number of medical facilities?    Mr. Cummings. Well, going back to this particular clinic, I think I would conclude that it's a success story. According to USAID, the percentage of women in Afghanistan receiving prenatal care has increased from 16 percent in 2002 to 60 percent in 2010, and this has coincided with an infant mortality rate that has decreased by 53 percent. That is significant.    Mr. Cummings. And you would attribute that to our efforts?    Mr. Cummings. And why do you say that?    Mr. Cummings. So do you know what the life expectancy was? Do you have any comparison numbers?    Mr. Cummings. Thank you very much.
