    Mr. Vitiello. Thank you, Chairwoman McSally, Ranking Member Higgins, and the distinguished Members of the subcommittee, for the opportunity to testify today on behalf of the U.S. Border Patrol to discuss situational awareness and effectiveness.    Border Patrol operations along the U.S. border are constantly challenged by evolving tactics of transnational criminal organizations and individuals. To enhance our situational awareness and detect changes in threat levels and criminal flows across the border environment, the Border Patrol uses sophisticated technology and various tactics to gather information and intelligence. We collaborate with State, local, Tribal, as well as international law enforcement, intelligence, defense, and local community partners.    Thanks to the support of this subcommittee, CBP has deployed capable resources to increase our situational awareness along the Southern Border and our ability to rapidly respond as appropriate to areas of increasing risk. For example, integrated fixed towers deployed along the border in Arizona provide a long-range persistent surveillance. These tower systems automatically detect and track items of interest and provide centralized operations with video and geospatial location of suspected items of interest for identification and appropriate action.    Mobile technology, mounted on vehicles or carried by agents, is used in conjunction with fixed assets and provides the Border Patrol flexibility and agility to adapt to changing border conditions and threats. Tactical aerostats, acquired as part of the Department of Defense Reuse program, have also proven to be a vital asset in increasing CBP's situational awareness and our ability to detect, identify, and track illegal cross-border activity.    In addition to the use of surveillance technology, collaboration and information sharing with our law enforcement partners is a key component of building situational awareness and response capabilities along the Southwest Border. We work closely within CBP, especially with Air and Marine Operations, as well as multiple DHS, Federal, international, State, and local law enforcement agencies.    The Border Patrol is an active participant in the DHS Southern Border and Approaches Campaign and has a crucial role in the Joint Task Force-West, an integrated operational approach to addressing the threat of transnational criminal organizations along the Southwest Border. We also participate in regular briefings with Federal, State, and local partners regarding the current state of the border in order to monitor emerging trends and threats.    To ensure that the Border Patrol is positioned to respond to emerging threats, the Border Patrol uses a risk-based strategy to deploy resources. Our risk assessments are formed by multiple indicators, including the interdiction effectiveness rate, which is the percent of detected illegal entrants who are apprehended or turned back after illegally entering the United States between the ports of entry.    Furthermore, in coordination with the new DHS joint requirements process, the Border Patrol uses a Capability Gap Analysis Process to conduct mission analysis and identify capability gaps in specific geographic locations.    Because of the complexity of our border security mission, there is no single metric that can measure the full scope of our security efforts. Instead, we rely on a number of significant indicators to evaluate trends and developments over time, assess our performance, and refine our operations.    Tracking total apprehensions provides us information about the volume of people attempting to cross the border illegally. However, further analysis on the individual level can and does expand our understanding of changes in illegal activity between the ports.    For example, we consider the rates of recidivism or the percentage of apprehended individuals who have crossed the board illegally multiple times. This distinction is important in understanding the threat environment. Moreover, as a measure, it informs our decisions to redeploy resources to high-risk areas and to apply appropriate consequences in order to reduce repeat activity. Other analysis considerations include how many arrested individuals have criminal records, outstanding warrants, or were arrested while smuggling people or drugs.    This analysis, in conjunction with the information obtained from fixed and mobile surveillance systems and our law enforcement partners enhances situational awareness and better enables the Border Patrol to detect, identify, classify, monitor, and appropriately respond to threats and other challenges along our U.S. borders.    Thanks again for the opportunity to appear today. I look forward to answering your questions.    Joint Prepared Statement of Ronald Vitiello and Randolph D. Alles                             March 1, 2016    Chairwoman McSally, Ranking Member Vela, and distinguished Members of the subcommittee. It is a pleasure to appear before you today on behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to discuss measuring effectiveness and situational awareness of the Southwest Border.    Along the more than 5,000 miles of land border with Canada and Mexico, and approximately 95,000 miles of shoreline, CBP works with our DHS, interagency, and State and local partners to secure our borders and the associated airspace and maritime approaches to prevent illegal entry of people and goods into the United States, while also facilitating lawful trade and travel.    The border environment in which CBP works is dynamic and requires adaptation to respond to emerging threats and changing conditions. We appreciate the partnership and support we have received from this subcommittee, whose commitment to the security of the American people has enabled the continued deployment of resources and capabilities we need to secure the border.    The U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) and Air and Marine Operations (AMO), in conjunction with DHS Joint Task Force--West, have primary responsibility for the border security mission between the Nation's ports of entry (POEs) through the coordinated use of integrated assets to detect, interdict, and prevent acts of terrorism and the unlawful movement of people, illegal drugs, and contraband toward or across the borders of the United States. CBP implements intelligence-driven counter network strategies focused on areas of greatest risk, and deploys its capabilities to adapt to emerging threats along the border.    Detecting and interdicting terrorists and their weapons will always be a focused priority. Furthermore, the illegal cross-border activities of transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) and other bad actors pose a growing threat to border security and public safety. TCOs control most cross-border trafficking of guns and illegal drugs, and there is evidence of their increased involvement with human smuggling. Using a risk-informed and intelligence-driven approach, CBP will continue to enhance our efforts to anticipate and respond to threats to our National security, ensure the safety of the U.S. public, and deter, prevent, and disrupt future illegal activities.    As the preeminent law enforcement agency responsible for safeguarding and managing America's borders, CBP develops and sustains situational awareness of current and potential threats and associated risks. Situational awareness forms the cornerstone of our approach to proactively identify and eliminate criminal and illegal activity across the Nation's air, land, and maritime borders. It is derived from CBP's comprehensive understanding of the threat environment and provides an in-depth picture of the current operating conditions within a specific region of the border environment.    Situational awareness, like the border environment, is dynamic and grows through a variety of types of information collection--obtained through intelligence and surveillance technology--and analysis in the context of other regional or National cross-border trends, especially those concerning illicit trafficking and unlawful border crossings. CBP leverages a wide range of tactics, techniques, and sophisticated technologies to enhance situational awareness and increase CBP's ability to prevent and disrupt threats in the border environment.    The border environment in which CBP operates is challenged by continuously-evolving tactics of TCOs, terrorists, and other criminals. Detecting changes in threat levels and criminal flows across the border environment requires the use of various tactics to gather information and intelligence in both low- and high-threat areas. To promote and advance situational awareness, CBP deploys sophisticated surveillance and detection technology and collaborates with domestic and international law enforcement, intelligence, defense, and local community partners.                  advanced technology and capabilities    Thanks to the support of this subcommittee, CBP has deployed capable resources to increase our situational awareness, identify changes in the border environment, and rapidly respond, as appropriate, to areas of increasing risk. The use of technology in the border environment is an invaluable force multiplier to increase situational awareness.Along U.S. Borders    The information gleaned from fixed and mobile surveillance systems, ground sensors, imaging systems, and other advanced technologies enhances situational awareness and better enables CBP to detect, identify, classify, monitor, and appropriately respond to threats and other challenges along the U.S. borders.    The Integrated Fixed Tower (IFT) systems and Remote Video Surveillance Systems (RVSS) are fixed technology assets used in select areas along the Southwest Border. The IFT system is a series of fixed surveillance towers and equipment located in Arizona that provide long-range persistent surveillance. These tower systems automatically detect and track items of interest, and provide centralized operators with video and geospatial location of suspected items of interest for identification and appropriate action. RVSS provide short-, medium-, and long-range persistent surveillance mounted on stand-alone towers or other structures. The RVSS uses cameras, radio, and microwave transmitters to send video to a control room and enable a control room operator to remotely detect, identify, classify, and track targets using a video feed.    In some areas along the Southwest Border, CBP also uses Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS) and Imaging Sensors (IS), which contribute to improved situational awareness, agent safety, and rapid response. These sensors support our capability to detect and identify subjects. When a ground sensor is activated, an alarm is communicated to a data decoder that translates the sensor's activation data to a centralized operations center computer system. IS are a specific type of unattended ground sensor with an integrated camera and the ability to transmit images or video back to the operations center.    Fixed-system technology increases CBP's situational awareness and the Border Patrol's ability to detect, identify, classify, and track illicit activity by providing line-of-sight surveillance to efficiently detect incursions in varying terrain. CBP integrates mobile and portable systems to address areas where rugged terrain and dense ground cover may allow adversaries to penetrate through blind spots or avoid the coverage areas of fixed systems.    Working in conjunction with fixed surveillance assets, CBP's mobile technology assets provide flexibility and agility to adapt to changing border conditions and threats along the Southwest Border. Mobile Surveillance Capability systems provide long-range mobile surveillance with a suite of radar and camera sensors mounted on USBP vehicles. Mobile Video Surveillance Systems provide short- and medium-range mobile surveillance equipment mounted on telescoping masts via camera sensors mounted on USBP vehicles. Another system, the Agent Portable Surveillance System (APSS), does not need to be mounted to a vehicle. These current generation assets provide medium-range mobile surveillance mounted on a tripod and transported by three or more agents. Two agents remain on-site, one to operate the system, which automatically detects and tracks items of interest and provides the agent/operator with data and video of selected items of interest. Next generation APSS options are being explored.    These technologies not only provide significant security benefits and multiply the capabilities of law enforcement personnel to detect, identify, and respond to suspicious activity, but they also enhance public safety along the border. Mobile surveillance technology systems enable agents to position the technology where it is needed at a specific moment, extend our observational capabilities--in this case, by helping see through the darkness and increasing the accuracy and speed of our response.    CBP's Tactical Aerostats and Re-locatable Towers program, originally part of the Department of Defense (DoD) Reuse program, uses a mix of aerostats, towers, cameras, and radars to provide USBP with increased situational awareness through an advanced surveillance capability over a wide area. This capability has proven to be a vital asset in increasing CBP's ability to detect, identify, classify, and track activity. As of December 2015, USBP agents seized 122 tons of narcotics and conducted over 50,000 apprehensions of illegal border crossers with the assistance of existing aerostats and towers.    Technology is critical to border security operations. Through the deployment of these complementary and effective fixed and mobile systems, CBP gains more coverage and situational awareness of surveillance gaps, and increases its ability to adapt to changing conditions to effectively detect, identify, classify, track, and interdict potential threats along the borders.From the Air and the Sea    AMO increases CBP's situational awareness, enhances its detection and interdiction capabilities, and extends our border security zones, offering greater capacity to stop threats prior to reaching the Nation's shores. Through the use of coordinated and integrated air and marine capabilities--including fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), tethered aerostats and patrol and interdiction vessels--AMO detects, interdicts, and prevents acts of terrorism and the unlawful movement of people, illegal drugs, and other contraband toward or across U.S. borders. AMO conducts critical aerial and maritime surveillance, interdiction, investigation, and multi-domain awareness law enforcement operations, in addition to providing assistance to ground personnel.    AMO's fleet of aerial assets provides critical surveillance and situational awareness across the Nation's land borders, in the littoral waters, in the maritime approaches to the United States, and in the international source and transit zones.    AMO P-3 Long-Range Trackers and Airborne Early Warning Aircraft provide detection and interdiction capability in both the air and marine environments. Sophisticated sensors and high-endurance capability greatly increase CBP's range to counter illicit trafficking. P-3s are an integral part of the successful counter-narcotic missions operating in coordination with Joint Interagency Task Force (JIATF)--South. P-3s patrol in a 42 million-square-mile area that includes more than 41 nations, the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and maritime approaches to the United States.    Additionally, UAS are increasingly instrumental in CBP's layered and integrated approach to border security. AMO has deployed 6 UAS along the Southwest Border to detect, identify, and classify moving tracks of interest over land and sea. Four of these aircraft have Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER) capability, which is a side-looking airborne radar that detects illegal border crossers and relays their positions to field agents, while simultaneously capturing terrain change detection information across larger stretches of the border. UAS are also used to meet surveillance and other mission requirements along the Northern borders and in the drug source and transit zones. During fiscal year 2015, CBP's VADER-equipped UAS recorded 9,371 detections of illegal activity.    Multi-Role Enforcement Aircraft (MEA) have a multi-mode radar for use over water and land, an electro-optical/infrared camera system, and a satellite communications system. This highly adaptable and capable aircraft replaces several older, single-mission assets. An equally important and more capable asset is the DHC-8 Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA). It bridges the gap between the longer range P-3s and UAS and the smaller MEA. The DHC-8 is an invaluable situational awareness platform for AMO in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean.    AMO uses the Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) to provide land, maritime, and aerial domain awareness, including detection of low-altitude aircraft and other potential threats. CBP assumed responsibility of TARS from the U.S. Air Force in 2013, providing radar detection and monitoring of low-altitude aircraft and surface vessels along the U.S.-Mexico border, the Florida Straits, and a portion of the Caribbean. With 8 aerostat sites--6 along the Southwest Border, one in the Florida Keys, and one in Puerto Rico--the TARS elevated sensor mitigates the effect of the curvature of the earth and terrain-masking limitations associated with ground-based radars, enabling maximum long-range radar detection. In fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015 combined, TARS recorded nearly 1,000 suspected cross-border attempts of non-commercial aircraft, about 50 percent of all border-related radar detections in the air domain.    Some of the most important advancements in increasing CBP's situational awareness are in the area of data integration and exploitation. Downlink technology, paired with the BigPipe system, allows AMO to provide a video feed and situational awareness to its law enforcement partners in real time. In addition, the Minotaur mission integration system allows multiple aircraft to share information from multiple sources, providing a never-before-seen level of air, land, and sea domain awareness. As the Minotaur system evolves across the fleet, it will provide increased awareness for a greater number of users as the information is integrated into the Air and Marine Operations Center     A vital component of DHS's domain awareness capabilities, CBP's AMOC integrates the surveillance and law enforcement data capabilities of DHS's Federal and international partners. CBP agents assigned to AMOC serve to correlate information from USBP technology with AMOC's systems to close the gaps in situational awareness. This combined effort has contributed to a reduction in the ultra-light aircraft activity on the Southwest Border. Fiscal year 2015 suspect activity has decreased to 59 events from a high of 332 in fiscal year 2010. Office of Field Operations (OFO) officers from the National Targeting Center imbedded at AMOC use their tools to close the seam between commercial and general aviation suspect activity. Overall, AMOC evaluated almost 500,000 internal air tracks in fiscal year 2015 with a 99.99 percent successful resolution rate. AMOC has integrated DoD and FAA sensors into the CBP network to expand our awareness well beyond the U.S. air and maritime borders. The stemming of the panga-type boat threats on the West Coast is attributed to the whole of DHS (CBP, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement/Homeland Security Investigations) coordinated efforts with Mexican partners facilitated through this integration and collaboration.    Coordinating with extensive law enforcement and intelligence databases, including Classified systems and communication networks, AMOC enhances our situational awareness and uses its capability to coordinate a law enforcement response to suspect activity in the air, maritime, and land domains. AMOC systems are connected to nearly 150 locations in various agencies to enable collaboration. For example, in fiscal year 15 AMOC coordinated over 400 Mexican responses to illicit air traffic preventing it from crossing our borders.    CBP uses tactics such as periodic reconnaissance patrols, sign-cutting, tracking, and UAS flights to understand the threats faced along the Nation's borders and in the approaches. For example, CBP uses change-detection capabilities in various ways to gather information and intelligence in low-threat areas. Change-detection capabilities increase the level of situational awareness in all areas, including those areas currently assessed as lower risk. This allows CBP to continue focusing resources in areas where the highest risk exists, but to quickly identify any emerging threat adaptation through information and intelligence and take appropriate steps to rapidly minimize any new risk.    CBP's continued deployment of fixed and mobile border surveillance technology, integrated with AMOC's enhanced domain awareness capabilities, allows CBP the flexibility to shift more officers and agents from detection duties to the interdiction of illegal activities on our borders. Additionally, CBP is looking to the future by working closely with the DHS Science & Technology Directorate to identify and develop additional technologies to improve our situational awareness, surveillance, and detection capabilities along our land and maritime borders.                  intelligence and information sharing    Criminal intelligence sharing is a key component in building situational awareness efforts along the Southwest Border. CBP and participating component agencies contribute to several initiatives to improve the combined intelligence capabilities of Federal, State, local, Tribal, and international partners along the Southwest Border.    CBP hosts a monthly briefing/teleconference with State and local partners in order to monitor emerging trends and threats along the Southwest Border and provide a cross-component, multi-agency venue for discussing trends and threats. The weekly briefing focuses on narcotics, weapons, currency interdictions and alien apprehensions both at and between the Southwest Border. These briefings/teleconferences currently include participants from: DHS Joint Task Force West, ICE; USCG; Drug Enforcement Administration; Federal Bureau of Investigation; U.S. Northern Command; Joint Interagency Task Force-South; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; U.S. Attorneys' Offices; Naval Investigative Command; State Fusion Centers; and local law enforcement as appropriate.                        operational coordination    Secretary Johnson's Unity of Effort initiative has put in place new and strengthened management processes at DHS headquarters to enable more effective DHS component operations. In addition, DHS-wide border security activities are being strategically guided by the Southern Border and Approaches Campaign. Aimed at leveraging the range of unique Department roles, responsibilities, and capabilities, the Campaign enhances our operational approach to working together in a more unified way to address comprehensive threat environments. This cross-component strategy includes the development of 3 pilot DHS Joint Task Forces (JTF)--JTF-West, JTF-East, and JTF-Investigations.    The creation of the JTFs, unified joint task forces along the Southwest Border and in the approaches to the United States, increases information sharing with Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies; improves situational awareness, border-wide criminal intelligence-led interdiction operations; and addresses transnational threats and associated violence.    Over the last 10 years, DHS has significantly increased its border security capabilities by adding thousands of front-line law enforcement personnel, and making substantial investments in infrastructure, situational awareness, and surveillance technology, strategically deployed to areas of increasing challenge. This shift in border security resources and overall border security management is responsible for the significant decrease in the illegal flow of people across the Southwest Border over the last 10 years.    USBP and AMO use a risk-based strategy to deploy resources and address emerging threats. In coordination with the new DHS joint requirements process, USBP uses the Capability Gap Analysis Process (CGAP) to conduct mission analysis and identify capability gaps. From this analysis, USBP performs follow-on planning to identify operational requirements over the short-, mid-, and long-term and to identify potential solutions, which may (or may not) include technology, tactical infrastructure, or other solutions depending on the nature, scope, severity, and geographic location of a given capability gap. Terrain, threat, and other considerations vary greatly across sectors and regions, making a ``one size fits all'' approach ineffective. The AMO CGAP process is in the developmental stage at this time. Once completed, it will interface with USBP processes to further identify aviation technology solutions targeting border security initiatives.    As conditions on the ground or in the approaches change, CBP will adjust its operational posture and will continue to invest and focus border security resources in the most effective and efficient way possible to meet the Nation's border security needs.                         indicators of success    Thanks to this subcommittee's support, the Nation's long-term investment in border security continues to produce significant and positive results. Border Patrol apprehensions--an indicator of illegal entries--totaled 337,117 Nation-wide in fiscal year 2015, compared to 486,651 in fiscal year 2014. This represents a 30 percent decline in the last year and almost 80 percent below its most recent peak in fiscal year 2000. CBP Officers and Agents also played a critical counter-narcotics role, resulting in the seizure or disruption of more than 3.3 million pounds of narcotics in fiscal year 2015. In addition, the agency seized more than $129 million in unreported currency through integrated counter network operations. In fiscal year 2015, AMO contributed to the arrest of 4,485 suspects, the apprehension of more than 51,130 individuals, and the interdiction of more than 213,000 pounds of cocaine.    USBP uses the Consequence Delivery System (CDS) on the Southwest Border as a means to standardize decision making in the application of consequences and examines the efficiency and effectiveness of individual consequences on various types of deportable aliens. Recidivism and the average number of apprehensions per recidivist are the strongest indicators of CDS effectiveness. Since CDS implementation in fiscal year 2011, the annually reported recidivism rate has decreased from an average of 27 percent to 14 percent in fiscal year 2015 and average apprehensions per recidivist decreased from 2.71 to 2.38 in fiscal year 2015. Contributing factors to the reduction included reducing the percent of apprehensions resulting in a Voluntary Return, the least effective and efficient consequence, from 59 percent in fiscal year 2010 to 4 percent in fiscal year 2015; and applying more effective and efficient consequences to illegal aliens with a higher probability of making subsequent illegal entries.    CBP reports on several performance measures, in accordance with the Government Performance and Results (GRPA) Act of 1993 and the 2010 GPRA Modernization Act, and we are committed to the on-going monitoring and reporting of program accomplishments and progress toward meeting mission goals. AMO reports annually on a GPRA metric that tracks the percent of detected conventional aircraft incursions resolved along all borders of the United States. In fiscal year 2015, AMO reported a 99.3 percent border security success rate for this metric.    CBP recognizes the need for relevant performance measures to verify the effectiveness of our operations and assets. However, due to the sheer size of the air, land, and sea borders, and the motivation of individuals to illegally enter the United States, challenges still exist to measure our success. Furthermore, as border security operations become increasingly integrated, the ability to quantify individual contributions to shared outcomes becomes increasingly complex. AMO and USBP will continue to collaborate with internal and external partners to enhance current metrics, and develop new metrics, that provide meaningful outcome-focused measurements of illegal activity, trends, and effectiveness. We look forward to sharing these efforts with this subcommittee in the future.                               conclusion    To fully implement the risk-informed, counter network/intelligence-driven operations that focus our capabilities against the highest threats, CBP continually evaluates its effectiveness and enhances situational awareness and adjusts its resources as required.    The continued deployment of sophisticated fixed and mobile surveillance systems, in conjunction with intelligence and operational integration, enhances situational awareness and better enables CBP to plan effectively, enhance its agility, and appropriately respond to threats in the Nation's border regions and approaches to secure the homeland.    Chairwoman McSally, Ranking Member Vela, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. We look forward to your questions.    Mr. Vitiello. Thanks for that question. I won't sit here today and tell you that we know exactly what the denominator is. That is something that we have been trying to accomplish with regard to effectiveness.    I am reminded of Eisenhower's words to the military that plans are useless but the effort of planning is essential because it puts your team in the place where they can rapidly adjust to changing circumstances.    So what we have done over the last several years is signed ourselves up through the GPRA measures, which pinned into the foundation of the Government Performance Results Act, right, a requirement that Congress set for us. We looked at what was there that we could use, and we tried to strengthen our ability to measure effectiveness at the border. So when an agent has an encounter, when an entry is noticed, how many people are apprehended in that encounter, and what are the results of people who either ran back across the border or eventually got away.    So I can't say that that is a perfect endeavor because it is done by human beings. What I can say is that we have a systematic protocol that allows agents to assess zone by zone, line by line at the border, talk about how many entries, record those entries, and then record the encounters as they see them in real time.    There are lots of places, as you know, they are very rural, very remote, it is difficult for us to access the border. But what we try to do is we have a systematic way of recording entries and then subtracting what happens after the encounters, either got away, turned back, or apprehended. Then we put that math together and we sign ourselves up for the effectiveness rate.    Mr. Vitiello. Right. But there is an assessment line for every part of the border. It is not just the entries that we see or know about. There are places where we can see entries in real time because of the deployment, because of the fixed towers, because of the mobile technology that agents have, their own observations, they are at the line and they see people come across. So all of that activity is recorded, the ones that are seen and the ones that are not seen but have left evidence of the entry.    Mr. Vitiello. What we do for the recording, yes, that gets us to 81 percent for the year.    Mr. Vitiello. Not perfectly.    Mr. Vitiello. So about 56 percent of the border is--we kind-of segment the border into 2 specific categories. Of all the things that we do, not just on the effectiveness rate but all the things we are trying to record, about 56 percent of the border is deployed in a way that agents and/or our technology can see activity in real time.    Mr. Vitiello. We record all the encounters and all the----    Mr. Vitiello. It would be in part of that math, yes.    Mr. Vitiello. So our concerns on the Northern Border are the same in the sense that you want situational awareness. You want to understand what is happening. You want to know what the trends are. The challenge is understanding what the criminal networks are doing and how they are trying to defeat border enforcement and border security.    I think the biggest challenge is there is lots of open space. Like what we talked about earlier, there is 56 percent on the Northern Border. The other 44 percent is covered by technology. So the Air and Marine Operations flies on our behalf the UAS that can give us an assessment of the border in those locations where the deployment isn't dense enough to see activity in real time. On the Northern Border, that is more common than it is on the Southern Border.    So the challenge is, is being in the right places. That has to be informed by intelligence. We do have ways to overcome that. We have good collaboration amongst the DHS entities on the Northern Border, amongst the State and local law enforcement on the Northern Border, as well as a robust relationship with Canada, both on the law enforcement and the intelligence side.    Mr. Vitiello. So we are constantly looking at things. There has been some activity of people going from the United States into Canada. So it is a good relationship with us and the RCMP on that particular facet. Then we are concerned about people who are in Canada that may be ideologically aligned with the threats that the Nation faces writ large.    Mr. Vitiello. No, we are still doing the same kind--we still have set up the same constructs, the same liaison, the same interaction.    Mr. Vitiello. It is very good.    Mr. Vitiello. So that is something that we are aware of. Obviously, the terrorist threat is the one that is primary for the Department and CBP, as well as the Border Patrol. So that interaction with our counterparts in Canada, and then improving our awareness and our ability to detect trends and changes to include what cultural support exists for those kind of things in Canada.    Mr. Vitiello. It is nearly 2,000.    Mr. Vitiello. Correct.    Mr. Vitiello. Yes.    Mr. Vitiello. So we are in the range on the Northern Border for Border Patrol agents of about somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,000, 1,900 to 2,000.    Mr. Vitiello. Ten percent.    Mr. Vitiello. So it is something that we constantly look at. Obviously, if you speak to the chief that is in Buffalo, Brian Hastings, he will ask for more resources. It is something that we look at carefully to make sure that they are equipped to do what we are asking them to do.    Mr. Vitiello. So what we want to do is we want to resource to the threat and the risk. So, yes, that is primary for us, the Southwest Border, and then as needed on the Northern Border.    Mr. Vitiello. Yes. It is somewhere in the range of 1,200 agents down from the authorized staffing level.    Mr. Vitiello. So a robust recruitment effort, lots of reengineering in the hiring process, and trying to let people know that we are hiring and get folks out there. We are working with DOD on using some of their transition centers and do hub hiring with folks that are transitioning out of the military. So we are in those locations. Then we are hubbing some of the hiring processes in which we take the 5 or 6 steps that can all be done in a couple of days at locations, we are trying to do that as well.    Mr. Vitiello. So we are well aware and commented and accepted the recommendations from OIG to get those facilities in a condition that we expect them to be. If we are going to expect agents to deploy in those locations, we want them to be safe and healthy while they are doing it.    Mr. Vitiello. So we think it matters when we classify the arrests individually, right, do people have a prior criminal record, do they have a prior immigration history, and how many times they have crossed the border previously. So we think that if we are concentrated on what we do post-arrest, we have a system called a Consequence Delivery System which looks at the classification, tells us who is in front of us, and then applies the post-arrest consequence that is most appropriate for that class of individual. That has proven to be effective in a way that drove the recidivism down across the Southwest Border.    Mr. Vitiello. It is not.    Mr. Vitiello. So I think the biggest challenge is the vastness of the area that we are concerned with. So you can put a panga almost anywhere along the coast. So our job and what we have concentrated on is making the communities that are affected by this aware.    We have, obviously, worked well with Air and Marine for directed patrols and feeding the intelligence that we know about, particular activity levels. We have done the same kind of work with Mexico to understand where the departure locations are. Then we have redeployed agents and technology along the coast so that we can be better prepared when we do know of a landing or an impending landing.    Then, obviously, ICE on the follow-up for when these seizures are made, when we do interdict folks at sea or on the land in a panga, then they follow up and try to figure out what the network responsible, right, the criminal network that sent those people and that is part of their trafficking organization. So we have asked them to work back that information so that we can dismantle or disrupt that activity along the coast as well.    I think the general might have----    Mr. Vitiello. Yes, in the task force environment, this is their threat as well, and so there is lots of cooperation with regard to presence on the water for those elements, the State and locals that do have patrol capability. Then in the task force environment, they are part of the follow-up that goes into the investigation and tries to identify which networks are responsible and then do the prosecutions for us.    Then in the task force environment, under Operation Stone Garden in California, a lot of the resources that are applied through that grant are used for this activity, the task force environment specifically related to the offshore threat, the panga.    Mr. Vitiello. I can't speak to their profile as it relates to the investments or where they are at financially, but they are part of this response. So at the DHS level, they are in the task force environment. Obviously, they bring capabilities to the problem.    Mr. Vitiello. I would have to get specific with numbers, attrition that relates at the academy. But most of the attrition that we see is in the hiring process itself. In the academy, there is probably, I think it is in the range of 8 to 20 percent, somewhere in there. I could be more specific given some time to get back to you.    Mr. Vitiello. Yes. So there are a number of programs underway. The attrition at the academy isn't really the issue. Attrition overall is something that bears watching because we can maintain that investment if we do things to avoid attrition or to lower that number. But our main problem is touching enough people to apply and then people making it successfully through the hiring process.    Mr. Vitiello. So we did look at that in specific detail. If you look at the south Texas activity profile, the family units and the UACs, the UACs are not trying to evade us. So this idea of turning themselves in is absolutely right on. So it would affect the effectiveness rate for that part of the border.    It doesn't seem to hold true as you move west. So off the top of my head, if McAllen is in the 80 percent range with family units and UACs as part of the denominator, then it would be something less than that for adult males. It would be something less from that if you looked at the entire corridor, the sector itself.    But, again, what I would like to point out is that we really do want our agents to record these encounters in specific detail. We want those numbers to be credible.    Then anecdotally are the other trend lines, right? Interdiction effectiveness in and of itself is a good number. It is sticky. We all want to know how we do at bat. We all want to know our batting average. But there are other things that we are looking at that relate to overall activity.    So I take your point that if those numbers are included and we were claiming success at 81 percent and we were all done, no more investment is required, then it would be a problem. But that is not where we are at. What we want to do is we want the system to credibly count what happens and then make adjustments from that, looking at the other 11 factors, the output measures that we are looking at.    Mr. Vitiello. Yes. I am happy to get back to you specifically with that population separate from the overall numbers.    Mr. Vitiello. For the overall effectiveness, right. So if there is an encounter at the line and the person evades by going back into Mexico, for instance, well, then, yes, we would use that as an assessment of that encounter.    Mr. Vitiello. That is what we call a turn-back.    Mr. Vitiello. Of course, because all of the entries are recorded, that is part of the numerator as well, right? So if we see it directly, then that is counted. When people are encountered, the record of their entry is put into the system as well. So all of the back-and-forth is accounted for.    Mr. Vitiello. It depends on the timing but, generally, yes.    Mr. Vitiello. I believe if it is within 30 days of the recorded entry, yes.    Mr. Vitiello. We can typically track what gets turned over to us, yes. I am happy to show you that.    Mr. Vitiello. Correct.    Mr. Vitiello. Not specifically. I mean, I think what we do in this capability gap analysis is, when we task the field, we ask the agents on the ground, we ask the chiefs and the leadership in the field to say, hey, where are you being challenged by areas that lack control or have too high of activity where the risk is high, and then we would ask them.    Of that 1,300 miles, some of that would be, you know, the natural barrier in and of itself would negate having to put man-made structures there, but there are probably a couple of miles out there where agents would like to have a physical barrier to give them an advantage.    Mr. Vitiello. I don't know. I could----    Mr. Vitiello. I would like to be more specific.    Mr. Vitiello. The CGAP tells us exactly that, and I could give you a zone-by-zone picture of where that might be.    Mr. Vitiello. So we have seen great effect of the fencing, the wall that is there on the Southwest Border. I am not aware of a requirement on the Northern Border where a chief in the field or agents have said, hey, it would great to have a physical barrier here. The challenge on the Northern Border is not volume, like the Southern Border and it matters if you have a physical barrier. I have not seen a place on the Northern Border where fencing would make the difference.    But in the CGAP and what we charge the sectors to do, if that requirement came forward, we would look at it, we would analyze it against some of the data that we have about where the fencing is----    Mr. Vitiello. So if, in the CGAP, in the planning tool, if they said, hey, this challenge could be overcome with a physical barrier, then we would consider it that way.    Mr. Vitiello. I am not aware of a requirement on the Northern Border for fencing.    Mr. Vitiello. Oh, yes.    Mr. Vitiello. Absolutely has.    Mr. Vitiello. My experience is you have to have a bit of all of that. You have to have sort of the--our first function in the Border Patrol is being present on the border, patrolling the border. But that is best done with having the right kind of technology that cues the work of agents, having these important relationships both in the United States with local, State, and Tribal law enforcement, as well as our counterparts in Canada.    You have to have all of those things working together and then some awareness of the world-wide intelligence, what is happening both on the Northern and the Southern Border, inside those criminal networks, and where could the threats converge in certain locations. So you have to have a combination of things, resources, and information.    Mr. Vitiello. So we agree that we would like to do this work as close to the line as possible. It feeds into all kinds of the logistics and how we are effective and how we are moving activity and changing and assessing risk at those locations.    We can and do landmark all of the apprehensions, so the heat map is based on, you know, physical encounters that are recorded in real time. Then we do have a measure that looks at the number of apprehensions at a checkpoint versus what happens on the line.    So, yes, in all of the places that I worked, when I worked in Nogales--and I know this is true in Douglas when it was a lot busier than it is now--part of our quest was to compress the zone of enforcement and do this work as close to the line as possible. It makes us more efficient over time.    So, when you look at the effectiveness and you look at all the trends, the recidivism, the kinds of apprehensions that are being made of people who have criminal records, when you are looking at drug seizures, you want to have that done as close to the border as possible. Because we can landmark those apprehensions, we can show you in detail where most of the arrests are being made.    Mr. Vitiello. I will be happy to show you that.    Mr. Vitiello. Yeah, that is correct. As I have talked about capability gap analysis, there are several sectors that have come forward and asked for those assets so that they can be better at solving the problems we are asking them to.
