    Mr. Mulvaney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks everybody for doing this. This is actually one of the enjoyable hearings that we get to do. If you were here earlier today, you got an example of the unenjoyable ones.    Mr. Dodaro, let's start with you and some general language. I'm curious as to how we can help. I was struck by Mr. Cummings' opening comments saying that Congress is actually sort of lagging behind the executive branch when it comes to fixing things. Give me a couple of examples for me and my colleagues as to what Congress could be doing to help implement your recommendations. What--what have we ignored so far?    Mr. Mulvaney. Okay. Thank you.    Mr. Mulvaney. Do we need to change that statutorily or can that be done from an administrative or regulatory position?    Mr. Mulvaney. Got you.    Mr. Mulvaney. Stick with me on DOD because you've mentioned this a couple of times in your testimony to the other members. Talk to me about weapons procurement. I think everybody in here is interested in a strong national defense, but everybody in here is also interested in doing it a little more cost-effective way. You've got some interesting recommendations, don't you, on weapons acquisitions program--weapons program acquisitions?    Mr. Mulvaney. Is that just for the big programs or is that for the smaller ones as well?    Mr. Mulvaney. Okay.    Mr. Mulvaney. I could do this all afternoon, but unfortunately I don't have that time. Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you.    Mr. Chairman.
