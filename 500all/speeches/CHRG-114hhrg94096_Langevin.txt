    Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here, in particular General Flynn, a fellow Rhode Islander.    General, welcome back before the committee and thank you for your years of service.    So I would like to, my question would be for Dr. Lynch, and also for General Flynn, whoever wants to go first. Clearly, this rise of radical violent extremists didn't happen overnight. It was allowed to fester in many ways. Maybe it was the religious community, for whatever reason, as I understand it, was allowed to preach hate and violence, and a lot of the leaders in the Middle East kind of looked the other way and for whatever reason. So it kind of took a long time to get here. It is going to take a long time to get out of it. But let me ask you, do the statements from, for example, President el-Sisi, in Egypt, which I found surprising, but welcome, a welcome statement when he spoke to the religious community there or establishing Sunni imams in the greater Middle East who have denounced the violence of ISIL or Islamic extremism more broadly, do they moderate, or you know, counter the nature of the grievances, and the threat from jihadists in the region? Or are these steps having the reverse effect of reinforcing the jihadist ideology and grievance narrative? Can you comment on that?    Mr. Langevin. Yeah, so are there things that we can focus on in our strategy to help encourage that kind of moderation? But let me ask you also, given that there are certain actors in the region, such as UAE and Jordan, among others, who appear to be supporting U.S. interests, how should the United States support and organize these partners in the region to serve as potentially moderating influences within the greater Middle East?    Mr. Langevin. Thank you all.    I yield back.    The Chairman. As you all know, they have called votes. I think we will have time probably to get two more folks in.    Mr. Cook.
