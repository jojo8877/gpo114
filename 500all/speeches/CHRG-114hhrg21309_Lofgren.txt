    Ms. Lofgren. Just to add that it is good to see the follow-up from the work that we did on the task force.    And I yield back.    The Chairman. Any other Member?    If not, I move the Committee adopt the Committee Resolution. The question is on the motion to adopt the resolution.    All Members in favor, signify by saying aye.    Opposed, say nay.    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, the ayes have it. The motion is agreed to. Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.    We now call before the Committee our next agenda item, which is H.R. 5160, a bill to amend Title 40, United States Code, to include as part of the buildings and grounds of the National Gallery of Art any buildings and other areas within the boundaries of any real estate or other property interests acquired by the National Gallery of Art.    Without objection, the first reading of the bill is dispensed with and the bill is considered read and open for amendment at any point.    Ms. Lofgren. You are surrounded by them.    The Chairman. All right, gentlemen.    Any other Member?    Okay. If not, I move that the Committee favorably report the bill to the House. The question is on the motion.    All the Members that are in favor of the motion, signify by saying aye.    Opposed, say nay.    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, the ayes have it. The motion is agreed to. Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.    I would ask unanimous consent that the staff be authorized to make technical and conforming changes to the measure the Committee just considered.    Without objection, so ordered.    And this concludes today's markup. Without objection, this part of the meeting is adjourned, and we will have the Chief come in and start with our hearing.
