    Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    First of all, I want to thank all of the witnesses. It has been a very enlightening hearing. So thank you all for being here today.    We have had several exchanges from Members regarding this idea of prosecutorial discretion. As a former prosecutor myself, I understand and appreciate the need for prosecutorial discretion when it comes to ensuring justice. That is the role of the prosecutor.    However, what I do not understand, in this context, is how this remedy that has been created, deferred action, exceeds what we now know as prosecutorial discretion. And in fact, Professor Foley, you indicated that the President's immigration order is unconstitutional for three reasons, and this was the second reason, and that was the creation of the remedy deferred action. Can you expound on that and tell me how it is different from ordinary prosecutorial discretion?    Mr. Bishop. Thank you very much.    Professor Blackman, is this something that you can comment on as well?    Mr. Bishop. Thank you very much.
