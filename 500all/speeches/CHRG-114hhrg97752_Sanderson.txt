    Mr. Sanderson. Thank you, Chairman Poe and Ranking Member Keating and distinguished members of the subcommittee for the honor and opportunity to testify before you today on the challenge of ISIS following these recent attacks in Paris, Beirut, and in the skies over Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. I come to you with a perspective of from field work on terrorism and conflict across nearly 70 countries over the last 15 years. This includes interviews this year with current and former ISIS members who ply the border on Turkey's side quite freely.    The question before us today is whether these attacks represent a strategic shift for ISIS, what policy options the U.S. might have, and how those attacks are impacting our understanding of ISIS.    First, the attacks. I do not believe that the three strikes represent a fundamental shift for ISIS, but rather a logical evolution for an organization that is under heavy pressure in some areas, has always looked to strike its enemies, and one which has designs on territory well beyond Syria and Iraq.    But just because these attacks may not be unsurprising does not mean we should not be alarmed. ISIS has claimed three strikes, two conducted by cells trained in Syria and one in Egypt conducted by an ISIS affiliate, which signal that the threat is growing, is very bold, technically adept with both encrypted communications and bomb miniaturization, and that expeditionary, out-of-area attacks are to be expected. We should act aggressively and smartly in countering them.    ISIS has long called for strikes on states such as France, a nation for which ISIS has tremendous hatred and disdain. ISIS also counts hundreds, if not thousands of members who hail from France, affording them plenty of French passport holders who can maneuver in the country, across Europe, and into the United States.    The attack in Lebanon was a bold move for ISIS and was likely carried out in retaliation for Hezbollah's support to the Syrian military. In Egypt, the ISIS affiliate, Sinai Province, has battled with Egyptian forces for years. The group is well aware of Russia's friendship with President Sisi of Egypt and with President Assad of Syria and is certainly mindful of Russia's disposition toward its own citizens who have joined ISIS. And of course, it is likely that the attack on the Russian airliner was as much targeted at Egypt's tourism industry, and by extension the Sisi government in Cairo, as it was on the Russians themselves.    It is important for us to look at statements from ISIS over the past couple of years to understand how these attacks, especially Paris, fit in with the ISIS strategy. The ISIS strategy is focused on establishing and protecting its territory along the Syria-Iraq border and to build influence beyond that space. ISIS has reached out to Muslims the world over calling them to help run, build, and defend the Muslim caliphate. These calls often came with encouragement to attack ISIS enemies and promises that one day they will conquer Rome, shorthand for much of the West.    In the October 2014 issue of their English language publication Dabiq, ISIS spoke of targeting the West and others in the coalition. This included statements such as,        ``At this point in the crusade against the Islamic         State, it is important that attacks take place in every         country that has entered into the alliance against the         Islamic State, especially the U.S., U.K., France,         Australia, and Germany. Every Muslim should get out of         his house, find a crusader and kill them, and the         Islamic State will remain until its banner flies over         Rome.''    It is also important to note that over the last 2 years ISIS has accepted pledges of loyalty from fighters from around the globe, including Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Nigeria, Russia, the Philippines, Pakistan, and many others, further expanding the ISIS footprint on the globe and reminding us that their base in Syria and Iraq is not the extent of their ambition.    What should these attacks tell us about ISIS? Well, the attacks signal that ISIS intends to strike where necessary and when pressured. I fully expect them to target the United States and other members of the anti-ISIS coalition, and of course they have said that they are going to do that. For a group that is so focused on imagery, as seen in the thousands of well-choreographed messages, images, videos distributed every day, this is a group that must be seen as making progress.    These three attacks also tell us that ISIS, its affiliates, and supported cells, are able to strike successfully in hostile territory. In Paris, ISIS executed multiple attacks with several individuals moving between France, Syria, and Belgium, and did so in the midst of very competent law enforcement and intelligence agencies. In Lebanon, ISIS was able to operate covertly in a denied area crawling with highly suspicious, alert, and well-armed, well-trained Lebanese Hezbollah. Finally, in Egypt, ISIS affiliate Sinai Province was able to penetrate airport security and emplace a bomb that destroyed a Russian airliner, killing 224 people.    These successful attacks are alarming for reasons far beyond the skillful tradecraft that was put on display. The impact is also felt in the recruiting realm. Given that ISIS offers a sense of mission, purpose, adventure, and revenge for young radicalized people, such attacks serve as a tremendous stimulant for these potential recruits. The attacks also demonstrate the possibilities for lone wolves or organized cells and signal that ISIS can make them happen over distance, in unfriendly spaces, and for little cost. From their perch on the margins of society, potential ISIS members witnessed the Paris, Beirut, and Sinai operations, and they want in on that action.    Let's now consider the implications and possible responses. The most recent ISIS attacks present troubling implications for U.S. security and our anti-ISIS strategy. In Lebanon, ISIS has struck the state that remains fragile and which borders Israel and is home to 1 million Syrian refugees. The attack on the Russian airliner demonstrates that commercial aviation remains a very attractive, viable target for terrorists.    The Paris attack offers the most significant concern for U.S. security. This long distance, sophisticated, high-risk ISIS operation succeeded on all levels. A leading member of the anti-ISIS coalition and close ally of the U.S. suffered a dramatic blow.    With these examples and others in hand, it is not difficult to envision ISIS supporting a cell or lone wolves in similar operations inside the U.S. This would represent a bigger challenge for ISIS, but I do not think it is impossible by any means.    Our response must be well conceived, precise, forceful, multidimensional, integrated, and enduring. But I will state upfront, I do not have a lot of confidence that we will succeed in many visible and tangible ways. Our country is not currently in the right frame of mind to take on this challenge. Many of our partners are incredibly problematic and the conditions and factors at play are so numerous and immensely complicated that I hardly know where to begin.    Let me suggest some of the key actions that are needed in a campaign to gain some advantage in what will turn out to be an evolution in the violence and not a clear-cut victory. The Obama administration's objection to putting large forces on the ground is well-founded, but we need a much more aggressive posture in what we are doing now.    The most important things we can strive for are political progress in both Syria and Iraq, ISIS leadership decapitation, more targeted strikes from the air, more flexible ROE with those strikes, territory denial, counterfinance and countermessaging.    To make some progress in these areas we need to strengthen efforts at diplomacy, intelligence, special operations, the air strikes, training local forces, anticorruption, counterradicalization, good governance, and by addressing socioeconomic and political conditions where ISIS operates and, importantly, where they recruit. That list is a very tall order and it is not even exhaustive.    I realize that we have ongoing efforts in each of these areas, but we clearly need to do more. We know what ISIS can do and we know where else they want to take the battle. So it is time to come together politically and to attack ISIS aggressively and intelligently. And if we as Americans lead, others will stand with us. Let's not wait for Washington to be hit before doing what is right and what is possible.    Mr. Sanderson. Congressman, I wanted to relate a story--to answer your question very quickly, no, of course we do not have enough people telling that story, certainly not in comparison to the numbers within ISIS that are telling their story.    The 16-year-old that I interviewed on the Turkish-Syrian border joined ISIS in January of this year. He was the youngest of 21 children. His father died a year ago. He was in ISIS for 2 months. And the reason he left was because within 2 weeks of entering the training program ISIS vectored these young recruits against an attacking force that was coming to seize a salt mine that ISIS controlled. ISIS made up a story about who those attackers were, said they were bandits, criminals, et cetera. It was the Nusra Front.    And this young man and his friend left because of the lies that ISIS told about the Nusra Front, which is very popular among many Syrians for its high content of Syrian leadership and for its direct attacks again the Syrian Government. So he left because of the lies that ISIS had told him and the other young recruits who just after 2 weeks of training were put into action against the Nusra Front.    Mr. Sanderson. Oh, yeah.    Mr. Sanderson. Thank you, Congresswoman. I would support your suggestion that they have not been true partners. From day one, they have facilitated the movement of extremist fighters through their border to fight Kurds and to fight the Assad regime. Fighting the Assad regime is a good goal, but fighting the Kurds has not been, and they are our best partner on the ground.    They have tightened their borders a little bit, but they still see these elements, these extremist Islamist fighters coming in as doing their bidding against Kurds in particular. They do have a big border, but they have allowed these fighters, fighters I have interviewed, fighters that have been treated in Turkish hospitals, and I have seen those medical records and I have seen those fighters, they still ply the borders from Turkey's side.    I do not know what we can do to turn the screws on them. They seem to have an awful lot of leverage. The President has publicly upbraided them for not doing all that they can. But we take a lot of advantage from using the Incirlik Air Force Base there. That is part of the deal we have with Turkey.    Unfortunately, I think they hold a lot of the cards. And as powerful as the U.S. can be, in this area, the Turks are very much a tier 1 actor and they can call a lot of the shots. But they are not being nearly as helpful as they could be.    Mr. Sanderson. No, Congressman.
