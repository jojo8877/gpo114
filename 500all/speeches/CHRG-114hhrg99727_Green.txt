    Mr.  Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would echo the commentary made by my colleague with reference to the benefits that we have derived from these various hearings, and I salute you and my ranking member for the way you have worked together to help facilitate the free flow of information. Thank you very much.    With reference to information sharing, there are arguments made with reference to technology being a problem, and then there are other arguments that are made with reference to organizational inertia, infrastructure, and culture.    How much of the fusion of information between various agencies is impeded by culture, organizational inertia, and structure within the various entities that should be conversing with each other?    Ms. Shelley, you ventured into this a little bit earlier. Would you care to respond?    Mr.  Green. How much of that, if you can in some way quantify it, is related to technology, the inability to automate a system that will allow this type of information to flow between entities? How much of it is related to the technology versus the culture within the various organizations?    Do we have organizations that have somehow structured themselves such that it is very difficult for them to pass information on even when there is a desire to do so?    Mr.  Green. Yes, sir.    Mr.  Green. I see one additional person--Mr. Modell, you are nodding. Do you have something you would like to say?    Mr.  Green. I have exceeded my time.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
