    Ms. Frankel. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Thanks to the witnesses.    I want to start by saying that I think most of us agree that what is going on in Syria is one of the greatest humanitarian tragedies of our lifetime since World War II. And there is no question that we have to do whatever is reasonably possible to be part of efforts to relieve some of the suffering, the starvation, the homelessness. And because we are going to lose a generation of people, of young people who are not getting health care or getting education. So I want to say that I appreciate your efforts to try to make sure that it is done right.    My first question is, in your review of these--of the programs, can you tell us, are any programs doing better than others? And what is it that--where things are working, what makes it different?    Ms. Frankel. In your review, were you able to determine where aid is actually getting through to? Because I know there is--you have regime-held areas and you have ISIL-held areas and then you have, I guess, other areas.    Ms. Frankel. So is aid going to the Assad-controlled areas?    Ms. Frankel. So Assad is not--which countries are being used, which borders, to get the assistance across?    Ms. Frankel. And how cooperative have their governments been and their military that is on the border?    Ms. Frankel. That they have been given good cooperation. All right.    I have nothing further. Thank you.    I yield back.
