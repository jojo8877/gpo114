    Mr. Davis. Thank you, Chairman Miller. And I wish you well on your next endeavor, going to work for the Smithsonian, as you mentioned.    Please, sir, check her references.    Don't cut my mic, Judge Vargas.    First off, I want to say thank you, Mr. Acting Secretary. My twin boys, who are 14, going into the ninth grade, were part of a large high school group that was out just last week and enjoyed many of your facilities. Some of the feedback was that, obviously, besides hanging out with me, going to the Smithsonian was actually one of their favorite activities.    And it is something that we see many folks and families go through every day here. It is what you do on a regular basis. I think this Committee--hopefully, today you understand we truly appreciate what you do and what the many men and women who work at your facilities do on a regular basis to show what our Nation is all about. So thank you for that.    Education was a key point of your opening testimony. And I noticed you mentioned some of the STEM programs, that the Smithsonian works with school districts throughout this Nation, especially K through 12 education.    Can you actually go into a little further what you do at the Smithsonian to ensure that our students who may not be able to make it out here to Washington, D.C., or to other facilities in the Nation--how do they have access to your facilities? And how do your STEM programs work? And, also, how do teachers who may not be involved with them know how to contact you to get involved?    Mr. Davis. Well, I appreciate what you do to make that happen, again, for many students who don't get a chance to come out here and experience what we see and sometimes take for granted on a daily basis.    What can we do as an institution to help encourage more activity, more usage, of your programs?    Mr. Davis. All right. One last question.    Do you have an idea--if you can, give me an estimated percentage of how many school districts you are putting your STEM education program into nationwide.    Mr. Davis. That would be great.    Mr. Davis. Well, thank you very much for your time.    Madam Chairman, I am going to yield back so that our star pitcher from the congressional baseball game can have time to ask questions.    The Chairman. Thank you very much.    Mr. Walker, our star pitcher.
