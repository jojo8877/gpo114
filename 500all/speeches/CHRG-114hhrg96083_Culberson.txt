    Mr. Culberson. The Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee will come to order. It is a privilege to have with us today the Director of the FBI, Jim Comey. We are delighted to have you today with us, sir.    I want to also before we start, though, take a moment to recognize our newest member Mr. Palazzo from Mississippi. We are delighted to have you with us, Steve. I know we miss Alan a great deal. But we are delighted to have you, and very pleased to have with us the Chairman of the full committee. Thank you, Mr. Rogers, good to have you with us. And Mr. Fattah, we are going to go ahead and crank it up.    This is particularly appropriate today to have you with us, Mr. Chairman, because the 9/11 Commission has issued its findings this morning and we will talk a little bit about that today. But we are privileged to have you with us here in front of our subcommittee to present your 2016 budget request. It is a very important, complex and critical mission that the FBI has to perform. We have on this subcommittee over the years helped the FBI fulfill its mission. You are the lead agency in domestic anti-terrorism, counter intelligence, national security efforts, so a vital law enforcement effort.    And as you mentioned the other day, once criminals got hold of automobiles and could cross state lines and someone could hold up a bank in three different states on the same day it suddenly made the role of the FBI in fighting crime very, very important to the Congress in the 1920s and thirties. And your role has only grown over the years, and particularly in the light of the 9/11 attacks, the growing danger of cyber crime, the ongoing cyber warfare that is taking place invisibly against the United States and private industry. Your role in fighting human trafficking and financial fraud is just vitally, vitally important. And we have a responsibility to help make sure that you are able to do your job but also be sure that our constituents' hard earned tax dollars are wisely spent.    So we want to be sure in the budget request that you submit today on behalf of the FBI and the President that the subcommittee wants to be certain that we have scrubbed your budget and done everything we can to make certain that again our constituents' hard earned tax dollars are wisely and prudently spent. Particularly in light of the tremendous budget pressures we face in this very difficult budget year.    The report that was issued this morning by the 9/11 Commission, we are pleased to see the progress that the FBI has made in transforming itself, in light of the continuing challenges posed by terrorism and other global threats. I want to particularly thank the members of that Commission, Ed Meese, former Attorney General; Tim Roemer, former Congressman; and Bruce Hoffman with Georgetown University for their superb work. This Commission was put together at the instigation of my predecessor, Frank Wolf, and it is comforting to see the progress that the FBI has made in transforming itself in light of the 9/11 attacks.    We will be working through some tough questions in today's hearing, Mr. Director. And we want to make sure that the investments that we make in the FBI have a real impact in enhancing national security and reducing crime. We deeply appreciate your service to the nation and I would like to recognize Mr. Fattah for any comments that he would like to make.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. I am privileged to recognize the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Rogers from Kentucky.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Comey, I really appreciate, as the chairman said, your service to the country. Thank you for being here today. And we will of course submit your written testimony in its entirety as a part of the record, without objection. And welcome your testimony today, sir. And to the extent you can summarize it, we would be grateful. And again, we look forward to hearing from you, sir. Thank you.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Director Comey. I think it is especially appropriate you remind us all to keep your officers in our prayers. And our hearts go out to the families of those three agents who lost their lives. And that is something that all of us I know keep in the forefront of our mind, the sacrifice, the risk that all of you take in protecting us and the country from these incredibly complex and varied threats.    It is also apparent in this new era, the scale of the problem is so huge that you really do have to rely obviously on state and local authorities. It is a team effort. And the genius of America is, the founders envisioned a system where protecting lives and property, police powers, is vested originally in the states, and in the good hearts and common sense of individual Americans. So there is also a vital role I think for individual Americans to play in helping defend the country. It is really the most important role quite frankly since one thing our enemies will never be able to defeat is the good hearts, the good common sense of individual Americans defending their families, their homes, their neighborhoods, their communities. The work that our local police and sheriffs and state police officers do is just indispensable and that partnership with you is vital and I appreciate very much you mentioning it to us today.    And the evolving threat that we face was important motivation of course behind Chairman Wolf's amendment to create the 9/11 Commission, which released its unclassified report today. As I mentioned, former Attorney General Ed Meese, Congressman Tim Roemer, and Bruce Hoffman were authors of the report and I appreciate you mentioning it in your opening testimony.    One of the key recommendations they made that I know you have already begun to do and wanted to ask you to elaborate on a little more is the vitally important role that intelligence analysts play in the new world the FBI now confronts. And could you talk a little bit more about the work that you are doing to implement the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission to professionalize the intelligence analyst position within the     Mr. Culberson. And in particular in making the analyst positions, moving them into senior management level. Making sure they are integrated as far as possible, into your career service and in senior management positions?    Mr. Culberson. Talk to us if you could also sir about the panel's recommendation that the FBI adopt a five-year plan like the Defense Department, a strategic plan, and your work to implement that recommendation? And do you agree with the concept?    Mr. Culberson. The Commission also wanted to be sure that we recognized and point out to the public that your information sharing with state and local police departments and law enforcement authorities is a good news story. Talk to us a little bit more about that.    Mr. Culberson. Yes, I am confident that the first time we are going to spot someone who has come here to do us harm from overseas, a terrorist, it is going to be an average American, using their good judgment and their instincts to spot something peculiar and/or a local police officer or a local sheriff having spotted something that just their instincts as a good law enforcement officer tells them is out of place and wrong. So it is a good story. And frankly the entire 9/11 Commission recommendations, it is very encouraging to see that the sum of what they have sent the Congress in the unclassified version and the classified version is a good news story for the FBI, that you have done a good job in responding to 9/11. And we appreciate that very much, sir. Let me recognize Mr. Fattah.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Fattah.    Chairman Rogers.    Mr. Culberson. Not at all. Not at all.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Chairman, I think it is a top priority for us on this subcommittee, of keen interest to all of us in the Congress, but of particular interest to me in the work that you have done. I have had a chance to come out and hear some of the work in a classified setting; it is very impressive.    What advice could you--before we move on to Mr. Honda--very quickly, just, if you could, tell the American public out there listening just some good basic rules to protect themselves, good hygiene practices against cyber attack on their own computers or smart phones at home.    Mr. Culberson. And more dangerous.    Mr. Culberson. And I heard your wonderful analyst tell us at a hearing in a classified setting we had, Mr. Chairman, with some of your cyber folks, that 80 percent of protecting yourself against a cyber attack is good hygiene, like washing your hands after a meal or some of the basic things that you have just mentioned to us. Thank you, Director.    Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. We will explore that and also the level of violence police officers encounter every day in their difficult and dangerous work on our behalf.    Let me recognize the State of Mississippi and our newest member, Mr. Palazzo.    Mr. Culberson. Following up very briefly on Mr. Palazzo's point about China. A back door, a Trojan horse, can be created into a computer system either with a piece of software that you might be able to detect, or it can be hardwired into a computer device, a computer chip, or a piece of telecommunications equipment as a piece of hardware, and it is invisible, and you cannot see it.    And the problem is so bad with the Chinese in general, and Huawei in particular, and these Chinese owned companies, that the Australian government actually just prohibited the purchase of any Huawei telecommunications equipment by any governmental entity in Australia.    Let me recognize at this time, Mr. Aderholt, and the State of Alabama.    Mr. Culberson. Chairman Aderholt asked a great question. Also, I would love for you to talk to us, very briefly, about that court case before the Supreme Court recently where the phone was seized in a part of a routine police arrest, and the police picked up the phone, and looked at it, and the guy said, ``You can't look at it.'' Talk to us a little bit about that case and what, if anything, we could do, for example, cannot Apple see what is on here under a court order? Could you not get it from Apple?    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. Judge Carter has dealt with this quite a bit as a District Court judge and----    Mr. Culberson . I'd like to turn to our colleague from Texas, Chairman Carter.    Mr. Culberson. Judge, if I could ask you about--and Director Comey, you can pitch in--if you had a case in front of you where you had evidence that there was evidence of a crime in a safe that was locked and only the owner had the combination to the safe, how would you handle that?    Mr. Culberson. Yeah, you can crack the safe, right? You just get a court order, you go crack the safe.    Mr. Culberson. Right.    Mr. Culberson. The analogy seems valid, doesn't it? It is like a safe that is locked up they are holding evidence of a crime.    Mr. Culberson. Yeah, it is a great question.    Mr. Culberson. I think the (indiscernible) is legal issue in a situation that is based----    Mr. Culberson. It is an interesting question, I do not mean to--forgive us, Judge, we----    Mr. Culberson. It is a really interesting conversation that Chairman Aderholt started here and I am glad to get the Judge's wisdom on this.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Judge. It is complicated so it is an incredibly complex universe of computer out there.    Now I recognize the State of Washington, Ms. Herrera Beutler.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much. Mrs. Roby, you are now----    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mrs. Roby. I wanted, if I could, to follow up on one of the questions that Chairman Rogers brought up about foreign fighters. Director Comey, at--we have seen estimates there are as many as 20,000 traveled from 90 different countries to fight in Syria, and we have heard reports there is about 150 Americans that have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight with ISIS or other terrorist groups.    And could you talk to the committee--and I recognize this is an unclassified setting--about your ability to be able to identify and keep track of these folks and the Americans that may be traveling over there. And what can this subcommittee do to help you deal with that threat?    Mr. Culberson. Well, also, we have the benefit of having Judge Carter, Chairman of Homeland Security, with us, talk to us about in particular, Judge Carter, how is TSA and Homeland Security doing? How are they working with you and making sure they identify and flag these folks?    Mr. Culberson. What recommendations would you make to the Chairman about anything Homeland needs to be doing?    Mr. Culberson. Well, but, my understanding, Judge, is that--and Director--that the United States does not have the ability to track visas. If they overstay their visa, we are not doing a good job, Judge--and correct me if I'm wrong--on tracking these guys once they are in the country. We do not know exactly when they----    Mr. Culberson. That is why I was asking the question, Director.    Mr. Culberson. But you can spot them when they leave the country if you flag their visa. If you got a reason to track somebody, you think they might be a problem, they leave the country or enter the country, Homeland Security is able to share that information?    Mr. Culberson. That is what I am wondering.    Mr. Culberson. Sure. Yeah.    Mr. Culberson. Right. Or overstays.    Mr. Culberson. We have--I know, also, the Patriot Act coming up for renewal here at the end of May, will expire. And I wanted to--because our constituents are rightly, as Mr. Fattah said, all of us have an interest in protecting the privacy of law-abiding Americans, as I know you do as well. And remembering Benjamin Franklin's admonition that those who would trade a little liberty for a little safety will soon wind up with neither. And that is an important lesson for us all to remember.    Could you talk to us about, and also the Americans watching today, the protections that The Patriot Act builds into the privacy, of making sure that the privacy of law-abiding Americans is protected, and the thresholds that you have got to cross in order to get a court order or access to people's phone records or their conversations and that suitcase that we all have with us.    Mr. Culberson. And how important The Patriot Act is to you.    Mr. Culberson. Texans can relate to that, so----    Mr. Culberson. And also important for people to remember, too, that Mr. Snowden is no hero.    Mr. Culberson. Can you talk a little bit about in an open setting why people should not think that what he did, and of him, as a hero?    Mr. Culberson. I remember he carried out, what, how many laptops?    Mr. Culberson. Exactly. Thank you for the extra time, Members. Mr. Fattah.    Mr. Culberson. But distinguishing--I know as Mr. Fattah would--between foreign nationals captured on a battlefield overseas versus an American citizen.    Mr. Culberson. Expertly done. I want to be sure to recognize Mr. Palazzo.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Judge Carter.    Mr. Culberson. And a great question and a good analogy, if the government is unable to defend that public space and provide protection if the marshal cannot be there for the little homestead outside of town, out in the Indian country, how--we have got all of us the right to self-defense to what extent does an individual or business have the right of self-defense, for example, in the cyber world? There is no clear answer, I guess.    Mr. Culberson. It is really an interesting question.    Mr. Culberson. Sure.    Mr. Culberson. And to follow up a little bit on the analogy earlier, the conversation about the Apple 6, in the case of a safe where you ordered--you have got a court order to go in and get the contents of a safe that you have probable cause to believe contains evidence of a crime, if the safe is uncrackable and either the owner cannot, or will not, open it, as a general rule, does the company that built the safe have the ability to open the safe? Is there any requirement with a physical safe, that they be--the company that built the safe--open it? Do you have the ability to open it? Is there any legal requirement? How did that work, Judge and Director, in your experience?    Mr. Culberson. But the manufacturer could tell you.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Judge. That is absolutely true, and I will not keep you too much longer, but you could either blow the safe or in your experience, the manufacturer always had the ability to open it----    Mr. Culberson . In some way, shape, or form.    Mr. Culberson. Just drill it or blow it.    Mr. Culberson. Yeah. Okay. Because that is another problem we are going to have to--again, protecting people's individual privacy, but recognizing if you have got evidence of a crime locked up in that suitcase, how in the world do you get at it?    Let me ask about, before we wrap up, and I will follow up with other questions for the record, the importance of information sharing with the Inspector General. It is a question that is ongoing with every agency under our jurisdiction. The Inspector Generals have a vital role notifying us of that they do audits and if the Inspector General is ever denied access to information, they have to notify the Committee, and we have gotten several notices from the Inspector General.    I know we have mentioned this to you and your folks before about the FBI's failure to comply with the access-to-information requirement, and I know that the FBI has a disagreement on what the law requires. And Mr. Fattah and I have both written a letter to the Attorney General asking the Office of Legal Counsel to help resolve a particular matter--I do not think involving a whistleblower's--to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.    I would just like to ask, sir, what steps are you taking to ensure the Inspector General gets the information they need in a timely manner and what, if any, conflict of interest, may there be in the agency being investigated by the Inspector General being in a position to decide what information the Inspector General needs? Particularly, since the Inspector General has, as you did, as a prosecutor, the ability to review things in a confidential manner and in camera, so to speak, as a judge would, since the Inspector General has criminal investigative authority and can maintain the confidentiality of that information, should not the IG be the one?    Are you be able to work with them in a confidential, behind-closed-door manner to decide what information they need? What are you doing to help them get what they need in this case, for example, in particular?    Mr. Culberson. I know that.    Mr. Culberson. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. What I am particularly interested in is getting it done in a timely fashion. What are you doing to help expedite the process so the Inspector General can get the information that they need to do their job?    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Honda. I also on behalf of the Subcommittee and the people of Texas that I am proud to represent, I want to express our deep gratitude to you and for your service and to the men and women of the FBI for all that you do to help keep us safe while protecting our privacy and our very precious constitutional rights. And as law-abiding Americans, we are your best back up. There is no better back up for a law enforcement officer than a American using their own common sense, their own good judgment, and their good hearts.    And by the way, you mentioned earlier about the criminals with guns, I doubt you have ever had a problem with a concealed carry permit holder who is licensed with a background check using their good judgment. I am not aware of any problems with the Texans that are licensed. Could you comment on that as a law enforcement officer and a prosecutor?    Mr. Culberson. With a concealed carry permit holder?                                      Wednesday, February 25, 2015.    Mr. Culberson. Good morning, Members. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies will come to order.    I am delighted to start out our hearing schedule this year with the inspectors general for the Department of Justice, Department of Commerce, and for NASA. Great way for us, I think, to set the framework for the year to get an understanding of some of the management challenges that each of these agencies face.    We particularly rely on your expertise and good work to help us identify where we can make the best use of our taxpayers' hard-earned money, make sure it is spent more wisely and efficiently to eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse, but also to be sure the agencies are accomplishing the purposes that the Congress has created them for.    It is a real privilege for me to be here to serve as chairman of this wonderful subcommittee and to succeed Frank Wolf who has really been a hero of mine since I got here. I really feel very sincerely that I am following Frank in the same position as Thomas Jefferson when he followed Benjamin Franklin and said no one can replace Dr. Franklin. I can only succeed him.    And that is certainly true. We are going to miss Frank a lot. He taught us all a great deal. It is a privilege to serve here with each one of you and especially you, Chaka. We have had a good time together in this subcommittee. We do great things and I am looking forward to a great year serving with you, my friend.    Mr. Culberson. Yeah.    Mr. Culberson. Yes. It is an important bill and feathers right in with the work you do, Chairman Carter, on Homeland. Looking forward to working with you.    We have a number of new Members of the committee. I am delighted to note that Washington State is so well represented, Mr. Kilmer, between you and Ms. Herrera Beutler.    You have what part of the state?    Mr. Culberson. The United States' only rain forest, I think, right?    Mr. Culberson. You are on that----    Mr. Culberson . Beautiful part of the country.    Mr. Culberson. Unlike England.    Mr. Culberson. Delighted to have you here.    Mr. Jenkins, delighted to have you here.    Mr. Culberson. West Virginia to be well represented. We got Martha Roby as a new Member of the subcommittee from Alabama, Mr. Jolly from Florida. And, of course, we have got Mr. Aderholt returning as a returning Member, of course, Mr. Honda and Mr. Serrano.    And we will be following the five-minute rule for questions roughly. I am not going to be exact about it, but we are going to try to keep things moving, make sure everybody gets the opportunity to ask questions.    I will recognize Members in order of seniority based on who is present at the beginning of the hearing and as Members come in, folks who come in a little bit later will go after those who came earlier.    And I know that as Mr. Fattah said, we will work hard together to make sure this is a bill that we, I hope, can all support in the end and will help, as I said earlier, ensure that our taxpayers' hard-earned dollars are well spent which is why I wanted to start with our inspector generals.    We have already got the national debt approaching $18 trillion and it is a continuing source of concern that with the President's budget request, for example, asking for tremendous increases in spending in every year in government, but he proposes to pay for it with tax increases. And that is certainly not going to happen.    We have a responsibility in the Appropriations Committee to be sure that the precious resources that we allocate are targeted and well spent.    So we really appreciate the work that you all do and we will hear first from Mr. Horowitz who is the inspector general for the Department of Justice and has been since 2012. We will next hear from Todd Zinser, the inspector general for the Department of Commerce where he has served since 2007 and then finally Paul Martin, the inspector general for NASA who has been working in that capacity since 2009.    Of course, we want to hear about your own budget requests, but if I could ask each one of you to zero in on, and we have received your prepared testimony which we will enter into the record without objection, but certainly welcome your summarization of that testimony, but particularly interested in, if you could, have us focus on recommendations to make the agencies more efficient and where we can achieve savings.    So deeply appreciate you being here, your service to the country, and, Mr. Horowitz, you are recognized. Oh, excuse me. Yeah. I apologize.    Chaka, if I could, I want to recognize you, sir, for any opening statement you would like to make.    Mr. Culberson. Very good.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. We are ready to roll.    Mr. Horowitz, thank you very much for being here today, sir, and we look forward to your testimony.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Horowitz, thank you.    And I wanted to first start with the FBI's refusal to provide you information. It applies to all the inspector generals. And for each one of us on Appropriations on the other subcommittees, this is highly relevant because it is not just the FBI. It is an ongoing problem with the inspector general across the spectrum of the Federal Government.    And every inspector general is essentially a--you have the ability to do criminal investigations as well.    Mr. Culberson. So you are used to handling sensitive information----    Mr. Culberson . In your jurisdiction.    Mr. Culberson. You are essentially like a U.S. attorney's office in that you have got obviously top-secret clearance. You are used to handling sensitive information and----    Mr. Culberson . Protecting it from being disclosed.    Mr. Culberson. When Judge Carter served as a district court judge, you reviewed, Judge, all the time, complicated material.    So the FBI's objection here is that the information cannot be released to you because they believe they have an obligation to withhold it--they are citing a number of different rules.    For example, the rule of civil procedure regarding grand jury materials, that is something you saw, Judge, I would imagine, as a part of your function.    There was not any problem with either Judge Carter releasing that or with you or any of the other inspector generals. That is standard operating procedure; is it not?    Mr. Culberson. Never had any issue?    Mr. Culberson. Never had a breach?    Mr. Culberson. The Wire Tap Act, again, standard operating procedure, no big deal. The Bank Secrecy Act, the FBI says we cannot give you the information because of the Bank Secrecy Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.    Mr. Culberson. Statutes that have been in the book for a while.    Mr. Culberson. And the inspector general statutes were probably enacted after these were enacted by Congress.    Mr. Culberson. Yeah.    Mr. Culberson. I do not mean to keep picking on Judge Carter, my good friend from Texas, but I believe, Judge, the standard rule of statutory interpretation is that the later enacted law supersedes the earlier one.    Mr. Culberson. That is just, again, standard operating procedure. We will certainly help you with this. And I hope each Member of the subcommittee will take this to heart in all our work on our other subcommittees, Mr. Fattah, because this is an ongoing problem across----    Mr. Culberson. Right.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much. We will certainly do that.    Mr. Culberson. And, Mr. Horowitz, if you could, to the extent you can do so in this setting, describe to us the type of information that the FBI is refusing to provide to you.    Mr. Culberson. And time.    Mr. Culberson. So what is amazing about 2010?    Mr. Culberson. I will come back with some other follow-up. I want to make sure the other Members get a chance to ask some questions. So I will recognize my good friend, Mr. Fattah, at this point.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Fattah.    Judge Carter.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Judge.    Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    Also, Mr. Horowitz, I have a keen interest in Judge Carter's question, so please copy me on that, would you?    Mr. Culberson. And find out about the number of removals the judges are actually ordering. Are they following the law? Are they doing their job? And then also, the recidivism is an incredibly important point.    And I think, Judge, I heard you say you discovered 42 percent of all defendants sentenced since----    Mr. Culberson. Forty-two percent sentenced in federal court are non-U.S. citizens, an incredible number.    Mr. Culberson. An incredible number.    Mr. Culberson. And which I see from your testimony----    Mr. Culberson . Is getting only more expensive as the population ages in the prisons.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. Thank you very much.    Let me recognize Mrs. Roby. Oh, excuse me. Mr. Jenkins. Forgive me.    Mr. Culberson. The President's budget is, of course, just a recommendation.    Mr. Culberson. Great questions.    I recognize Mrs. Roby.    Mr. Culberson. And that is just what they are auditing.    Mr. Culberson. As in each of your testimonies, I would be interested in what have you identified as best practices. This is just systemic. It just seems like in every federal agency--I got here in 2001. I came out of the state legislature in Texas. It is not as bad in state government, but it certainly seems to be just throughout the federal government, as Mrs. Roby was just saying that the waste and the fraud and the abuse is just maddening.    And if you could, as part of your testimony, for NASA, the Department of Commerce, and for DOJ, if you have found examples of programs that, on an ongoing basis, have done a good job of flushing out fraud, waste, and abuse, please let us know. I think about, Medicaid, if you identify Medicaid fraud and are able to bring it to the attention of the government, you can actually institute a qui tam lawsuit, I think it is called----    Mr. Culberson. . And recover five to ten percent of any fraud that you undercover.    Mr. Culberson. I think that would be great motivation for federal employees. Why not give them five percent of anything they can find. Is there anything like that in existing law that they can flush out and save the taxpayers a hundred million dollars. It would not be a bad thing to take home a $5 million payday. I think that would root out a lot of waste.    Mr. Culberson. It probably would not apply to congressmen--it would not apply to us, but federal employees.    Yes?    Mr. Culberson. I do want to point out that if there is any Marine Corps or Navy veterans in the room, that the--I understand that the Marine Corps, and now the Navy, are the first branches of the military to adopt generally accepted accounting procedures. So the Marine Corps and Navy can now be audited by an outside private accounting firm; is that your understanding as well?    Mr. Culberson. Yeah, it is a good thing.    Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    And the Office of Legal Counsel is simply an advisory opinion; that is not binding on anybody?    Mr. Culberson. Yes, please.    Mr. Culberson. And, fundamentally, and I have come to view our role as appropriators as, obviously, we have to allocate precious, hard-earned taxpayer resources, but really to be the enforcers. Fundamentally, we are the enforcers. The law is only as effective as it is enforced, and that is ultimately up to us.    I think you are exactly right, Mr. Jolly, that we will help motivate these folks and to do the right thing and follow the law.    Mr. Culberson. We can only appropriate our hard-earned taxpayers' dollars for lawful purposes, right?    Mr. Culberson. Yeah. We will be sure to help with that.    And, also, if they are producing documents--if the agency--you identified documents that you needed to pursue your investigation of the whistleblower case, for example, and the agency has the ability to go over those documents, I bet they are pounding on some employees that are identified in there that might be peripherally involved, I suspect, and that is a real problem.    Mr. Culberson. We will be sure to help in any way we can.    I have a number of other questions that I am going to submit for the record because I want to make sure that we are able to hear from the Department of Commerce and NASA. You have so many important responsibilities. I would like to meet with you separately----    Mr. Culberson . And certainly welcome any of the members who would want to join me in that, because you have covered a lot of really important topics in your audits, in your reports, and in your testimony today, and we deeply appreciate your service. And we will do everything we can on this subcommittee to help make sure that the law is enforced in a timely and appropriate fashion.    Mr. Culberson. Yes, Mr. Carter.    Mr. Culberson. Yeah, you got to----    Mr. Culberson. Exactly.    Mr. Culberson. Absolutely. And we will, I assure you that the staff and this subcommittee will all work together to make sure that there is ongoing and aggressive encouragement.    Mr. Culberson. Any other questions?    Thank you very much for your service to the country. I look forward to meeting with you privately and with other members of the committee.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much, Mr. Zinser.    What, if any, consequences are there for a Federal employee, for example, a Department of Commerce--frankly, I am sure it applies elsewhere as well--when they fail to comply with laws, rules, regulations, and ethics guidelines?    Mr. Culberson. What action did they take?    Mr. Culberson. A suspension?    Mr. Culberson. Such as?    Mr. Culberson. So the worst thing to do under Federal civil service guidelines, is a suspension?    Mr. Culberson. I will never forget this Exhibit A when I first got on a Military Construction VA Subcommittee--and Judge Carter may remember this as a fellow Texan--there was a cemetery director at the Houston VA cemetery in Houston who closed the chapel, removed the Menorah and the Bible, padlocked it, used it to store boxes, and turned off these--these guys had landed at Normandy Beach, I mean these wonderful old gentlemen who made it possible for us to be here--contributed money to build a carillon to chime bells--she turned that off and then forbid the families from praying over the grave of their deceased loved one.    I cannot imagine it getting worse than that, and I was Chairman of the Subcommittee and they would not fire her, would not even suspend her. The only way that I was able to get her removed is, I just frankly just had to get on the phone with the Secretary of the VA. Of course the entire State of Texas and all of Houston was in an uproar, understandably; it was just an outrage. They still did not fire her. All they did was move her to headquarters and put her in charge of proofreading memos. Just unbelievable.    What recommendations have you--would you make--and I would certainly welcome this from Mr. Martin, as well as Mr. Horowitz--to changes in personnel policy so that you can actually either penalize somebody? Obviously you also would want to reward them for good behavior, you know, award bonuses if you are doing a good job--but what recommendations would you have for us to change the law to allow for these agencies to actually ding people in the pocketbook and, frankly, remove them if necessary? For example, the polar satellite, someone who manages these incredibly expensive programs--if it is a technical problem, I understand it, but if it is incompetence--you see this over and over and over again--Mr. Martin has seen it, I am confident, in some of the NASA satellite programs where you have got these massive cost overruns. What recommendations do you have for us about how we can hold people accountable?    Frankly, as I am sure you know, Texas is an at-will State; if you do not do your job, you are fired. What do you recommend that we do at the federal level?    Mr. Culberson. Under the Civil Service Rules?    Mr. Culberson. I would certainly welcome--I know all of us would--your specific suggestions on how we could help change the law because it is just an ongoing, absolutely maddening problem.    Mr. Culberson. If you cannot fire somebody for not letting a family pray over the grave of a deceased veteran, you cannot fire anybody. That just is absolutely incredible.    I gather you have similar problems, as Mr. Horowitz, in being denied access to information, and I want to ask if you could talk to us a little bit about the challenges you have had getting information for the Department of Commerce. Do you have any information requests pending, and has the Secretary been helpful in making various Commerce Bureaus work cooperatively with your staff?    Mr. Culberson. No kidding?    Mr. Culberson. Oh, please let us help you. We would be delighted.    Mr. Culberson. As Mr. Jolly said earlier, we are the enforcers.    Mr. Culberson. One other quick question. If you are a grant recipient, State, local, or nonprofit, for example, and the agency is not doing proper oversight and the grant money has been misused in some way, what consequences, if any, are there for a grant recipient, as a general rule for the Department of Commerce?    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. That is what I was looking for.    Mr. Culberson. Does current law require a grant recipient who misuses the money or engages in fraud, waste or abuse, for example, to disgorge the money and return it? Is that current law or internal regulation guidelines for it?    Mr. Culberson. But if they are not using it for the purpose for which the grant was intended, for example, they just buy the drone, they do not get FAA approval or whatever, do they have to disgorge it and return the money?    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    Mr. Culberson. That is another one I would be interested in pursuing.    All right. Let me, if I could, recognize Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Kilmer.    And I recognize Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. And enforce it through this subcommittee.    Mr. Culberson. But you could certainly help identify whether or not they are using third-party data, as required by the statute----    Mr. Culberson. I would be happy to help with that.    It is a big issue in Texas----    Mr. Culberson. And the Governor's Office just spoke to me about it last week.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Honda. I recognize Ms. Herrera Beutler.    Mr. Culberson. The President's budget is only a recommendation, as I always remind the Agency.    Mr. Culberson. It is----    Mr. Culberson . Just one of many things we take into account, but we get to write the bill.    Mr. Culberson. And I want to follow up, if I could, Mr. Zinser on a couple of areas. I will submit the majority of my questions for the record in the interest of time, but to follow up on the census.    By the way, I would like to ask though, because I am keenly interested in getting good data, as Mr. Jolly was just talking about--particularly when it comes to NOAA and weather data--I am keenly interested in making sure we have got accurate temperature data. I am fascinated to see a couple of articles here. Recently some studies have been done showing that the Goddard Institute that was tracking weather data while James Hansen was there was averaging numbers, and filling in blank spots. I would like to visit with your folks separately about that, but if you could ask anyone if you have any audits or any examination you have done of the NOAA weather data that they have been collected for years and would really be interested to know when they were just filling in blank spots with numbers they made up, or are they actually using--you just want good data, right? You want to make sure you are getting good, objective, accurate data, particularly on something as important as when they are going to try to impose a carbon tax on us based on it, for example.    But I digress, let me get back to the census. I really want to follow up with you on that and Mr. Martin, accurate weather data, temperature data. As you mentioned in your opening statement, the cost of the census in 2010 was about $13 billion and you would think the cost the next time would go down. They have learned lessons from the last time and re-engineered it to hold the cost down below the 2010 census and currently the Census Bureau's cost model is predicting a cost of $12.6 billion for the 2020 census. Do you believe that estimate is accurate?    Mr. Culberson. What additional steps would you recommend for the Census to take to keep the cost of the 2020 census below that of 2010?    Mr. Culberson. What are your top three concerns about the cost, schedule and implementation of the 2020 Census?    Mr. Culberson. That is a serious one. I have always been a big believer that our most important right is the right to be left alone and I have a lot of constituents that really object, as I do, to this very long survey form. That long survey form the Census is using, was that a creation of statute or internal regulations at the Census Department?    Mr. Culberson. I will submit more about that in detail. It is frankly offensive and intrusive. Our most precious right as Americans is just to be left alone. It is aggravating.    I will submit a number of other questions for the record, so that we do not delay this unnecessarily, but let me see if I have got any followup. Yes?    Mr. Culberson. Sure.    Mr. Culberson. Right.    Mr. Culberson. Well, right. All they need to know is, how many people are in your house and what is your ancestry and age, fundamentally, is really all they are really looking for. And the questions, the long questionnaire form, I have seen one, they have sent it to my constituents and it is objectionable. And they also can fine you. I mean, they are threatening our constituents with all kinds of penalties if you do not comply with answering all these frankly intrusive questions.    And I am also really concerned about the protection of the privacy of the information. In Mr. Horowitz's analysis and the testimony he gave us for the Department of Justice he points out that there was an April, 2014 GAO report that analyzed just a statistical sample of fiscal year 2012 cyber incidents across 24 federal agencies, including the Department of Justice. GAO estimated that these federal agencies did not effectively or consistently demonstrate any action taken in response to the cyber attack in 65 percent of the cases. So I do not trust--and this is a great publication and I highly recommend it to all you guys. It is spooky. I object to the intrusive form of the question and, frankly, once it is in a Federal computer, if they are not even spotting 65 percent of the hacks----    Mr. Culberson. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. Just the basics, that is all they need.    Mr. Culberson. Yes, the fundamentals are fine.    Mr. Culberson. Privacy is a really important issue, I know for your constituents as it is for me. Texans do not like the government poking around their business. They are liable to get an unpleasant surprise if they come poking around too much. I had to put that in the record.    Mr. Jolly, any other questions, followup?    Mr. Culberson. As long as you get accurate data, that is what matters. Mr. Kilmer, any followup?    Mr. Culberson. I have a number of questions I will submit for the record. We will meet with you again to follow up on all this. And thank you very much for your testimony and your service to the country, Mr. Zinser.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. We will next move to Paul Martin, Inspector General for National Aeronautics and Space Administration.    Mr. Martin, thank you for your service to the country. I remember you from previous hearings and thank you for being here today. I will of course enter your statement without objection into the record in its entirety.    Mr. Culberson. We welcome your testimony today and look forward to hearing from you, sir. Thank you.    Mr. Culberson. Of course. You know how I feel about the space program.    Mr. Culberson. Do you agree that was their only option in light of their funding constraints?    Mr. Culberson. Forgive me. Continue.    Mr. Culberson. And those projects are often managed by a specific flight center depending on the type of mission and----    Mr. Culberson. Have you seen a difference in the way different flight centers handle? Are some more efficient than others?    Mr. Culberson. I noticed in the documentation that accompanied your testimony that in the manned space program--there was an analysis, you mentioned the program--on Page 4, ``The program's independent government cost estimates project significantly higher costs when NASA purchases flights from commercial companies rather than Russia.''    Could you talk to us a little bit about what we are paying today for flights from the Russians? It varies up to I think you said $70 million a flight, how and why will the cost will go up once NASA begins to purchase flights from Commercial?    Mr. Culberson. How much do you anticipate the average cost will be for Commercial Crew?    Mr. Culberson. How much is your charge in this average of $74 million----    Mr. Culberson . What do you anticipate? What makes you think that that cost is going to go up?    Mr. Culberson. Which is vitally important.    Mr. Culberson. So the principle reason this independent government cost estimate projected a significantly higher cost was based on what they anticipate is going to be a larger cost per flight using Commercial.    Mr. Culberson. You would anticipate then that the cost per flight for Commercial is going to be significantly higher than the Soyuz average of $74 million?    Mr. Culberson. Have you all prepared any estimates of what we, the Congress, needs to appropriate to make sure that the manned space program is back up and flying as fast as humanly possible, and that it is adequately funded? Because I note that is a recurring theme in the time that I've been on the subcommittee. I am just devoted to the space program, and scientific research, and space exploration, but it does seem to have been chronically under funded.    Have you come up with an estimate of what you anticipate would be necessary in order for NASA to stop doing, or be able to do? For example, as you mentioned earlier a lot of these complicated space flights are analyzing a number of systems simultaneously, and NASA has begun to prioritize those, as you said, and only work on a few of the most critical ones first in an effort to save money. What do they need, do you think--have you done that estimate?    Mr. Culberson. Have you seen any estimates like that done that I am not aware of?    Mr. Culberson. I have learned over the years--and you will see this, Mr. Kilmer, I know from your experience from working with Mr. Young--that Office of Management and Budget is basically the source of these estimates and I do not find them to be very accurate and reliable. I would rather get the estimates directly from NASA, and one of the things that I will be pursuing, and I would love to have the help of anybody and everybody in this subcommittee to do so, is to have the agencies submit their recommendations for what money they think they need to accomplish their mission directly to Congress and bypass OMB as does--does Legal Services count?    Voice. Legal Services counts.    Mr. Culberson. Directly to the Congress, because then we are getting an accurate estimate from the professionals that know what they need and not a bunch of bean counters over at OMB filtering it, and low-balling them, and making it more difficult for us. Again, it is a budget recommendation, but it does make it more difficult for us when they come in at a low number.    Mr. Culberson. And our wonderful staff got to beat--we got to beat our brains out trying to find the additional money that you guys need. And NASA's a strategic, vital, absolutely vital to the nation's security and prosperity for the future and it just is maddening, I know, for all of us. I am sure there is strong support in Washington State for the space program----    Mr. Culberson . Certainly I know Florida is partial to it, and we sure love them in Texas. But let me ask a couple of areas if I could, let me ask quickly about your ability to get access to the information.    Mr. Culberson. Okay. That is good news. That is good news. Can you provide us with an example or two of recommendations where--just two examples where NASA has implemented your recommendations to save money or create efficiency?    Mr. Culberson. Yes.    Mr. Culberson. Yes, I saw that in here.    Mr. Culberson. California would do it on behalf of NASA.    Mr. Culberson. California would do it on behalf of NASA.    Mr. Culberson. Is the recreational level, background level under Federal law?    Mr. Culberson. This is cleaning it to California law?    Mr. Culberson. Neither have signed.    Mr. Culberson. California standards.    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    Mr. Culberson. True.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, I did not mean to take so long. Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Jolly. Well, we have had several people contact our office concerned that your OIG office is over-classifying reports particularly about Commercial Crew, and Orion, and SLS, and I wondered if you could talk to me about any of those, and what process you go through in deciding what to classify?    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    Mr. Culberson. We are not aware of anything that you have--any information in your office that you have classified unless it dealt with somebody's personal information or a criminal investigation. Other than that----    Mr. Culberson. Good, good, good.    Mr. Culberson. Let me also ask about the weather data, that I mentioned earlier with Mr. Zinser. Have you ever analyzed the data quality? Weather data collected by, for example, I know Goddard was involved previously in data collection, analyzing old records of temperature, for example. Have you ever analyzed any----    Mr. Culberson. Okay.    Mr. Culberson. Something I would like to explore a little more with you separately.    Mr. Culberson. And we have a couple of highlights in here, areas where I had some questions. You mentioned in your September 2014 report that you found that ``the agency will not be able to meet its goal of cataloging 90 percent of near-Earth objects by 2020.'' Could you talk to me a little bit about that and what problems you identified there, because it is a low likelihood that it would happen but the effect would, obviously, be catastrophic.    We saw the reentry of the large meteor over Russia last February, because of the dash cams they all have. It came in from the sun, nobody even knew it was there. And talk to us about the problems with a near-Earth orbit program.    Mr. Culberson. 2020?    Mr. Culberson. About 140 meters in diameter.    Mr. Culberson. Big around, yes.    Mr. Culberson. City killers.    Mr. Culberson. September report?    Mr. Culberson. All right, sir, we will go through that and do whatever we can to help. It is an important part of NASA's function. And, frankly, to my mind, a little better use for the asteroid retrieval is to develop the next generation of rocket propulsion to demonstrate that they can actually move one of these asteroids if it was headed our direction.    Also I am concerned that there is a gap, potentially, coming up in the tracking and data relay satellite program. What are some of the recurring patterns you see, what is causing some of the problems in the management? Whether it be--you heard the testimony about NOAA and the joint polar satellite, there were too many chiefs overseeing it when it was split between Defense, Commerce, and NASA, I think now it is just Commerce and NASA handling it. What are some of the common themes you see that cause some of these problems with, for example, there are some techno problems with the James Webb Space Telescope, for it to jump from--what is it 3 billion originally estimate to now over 8?    Mr. Culberson. And climbing.    Mr. Culberson. I mean, it is a spectacular instrument and vital that we get it up and flying, it was a top priority of the Decadal Survey which we should always follow. But the cost overruns and the delays, it just seems to be, systemic and constant.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. Any follow-up?    Mr. Culberson. What common themes or threads do you see in each one of these large satellite programs or spacecraft designs where they seem to have a problem in meeting their cost estimates, they fall behind schedule, they go over budget. Are there any common themes that you see looking across NASA?    Mr. Culberson. I will go back and look at that report.    Mr. Culberson. Let me also ask you about the concerns that Chairman Wolf quite correctly had about Chinese nationals. The Chinese Space Program is owned lock, stock, and barrel by the People's Liberation Army, and we have prohibitions in our Bill that I will make sure we continue, it is really important to keep the Red Chinese out of our space program. In looking at the requirements and the law, that NASA makes sure they do not have any interaction with the Chinese Space Program. Talk to us about NASA's compliance with those requirements that Chairman Wolf quite correctly put in our Bill.    Mr. Culberson. You said there are over 1,200 Web applications that are potentially vulnerable that--how is NASA dealing with that?    Mr. Culberson. How is NASA dealing with it though? I mean are you satisfied that they are making----    Mr. Culberson. Talking, if I could, a little bit about keeping foreign nationals out of some of our flight centers. I know that--I was searching for this and just found it--you are referencing foreign nationals entering Ames's Flight Center, potentially having access to ITAR restricted information. ``On two occasions a senior Ames manager inappropriately shared documents with unlicensed foreign nationals.'' I think I saw in here that these foreign nationals are actually working with a university in the area and because the university was doing some research at Ames were given access.    Mr. Culberson. Even if they are with the university?    Mr. Culberson. I would be very interested in your help and your office----    Mr. Culberson . Making sure that those standards are followed because I had heard that that is not necessarily happening at Ames. I was just out there a few weeks ago.    Mr. Culberson. And I will go through some of these with you, and I will submit others for the record and meet with you separately and privately. I do not want to take too much of your time. We are going to face tight budgets and I do, if I could, really want to call on your help and the help of your staff in helping us find savings that we can use to help make sure that NASA gets the funding they need to do their job.    Mr. Culberson. And the freedom that they need and stability so they can do their job.    Mr. Culberson. Without the fear of having the rug jerked out from underneath them.    Mr. Culberson. Deeply appreciate your service.
