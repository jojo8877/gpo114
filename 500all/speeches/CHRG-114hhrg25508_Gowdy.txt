    Mr. Gowdy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be brief, and then I will yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, I think we are probably all prisoners to a certain extent to our own personal experience, so while I am open and interested of the experiences and expectations of others, I have never had a problem in any of the airports I have ever traveled to. I use Greenville-Spartanburg, I use Charlotte, I use DCA. The folks are professional.    My friend from Florida mentioned that there may be some Members of Congress and perhaps other people who consider themselves to be dignitaries who either expect or accept preferential treatment. The Members of Congress that I travel with don't expect it, and they wouldn't accept it if it were offered to them. And a Member of Congress has a little bit of obligation herself or himself to say no, I am going to stay in the line like everybody else.    So I am quite certain that your department can do better. I am quite certain that you have a plan to do better. I am also quite certain Congress can do better. So I am going to focus on fixing us, and I trust that you have a plan to fix TSA. And my experience with them is you have a really hard job with the zero margin for error. That is not much margin.    So with that, I would yield to the gentleman from Florida.
