    Ms. Frankel. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for this hearing.    And one of the things I have always been grateful, in terms of this Congress, which is often at each other's throats on both sides, is the bipartisan spirit and support of Israel and peace for both Israel and the Palestinians, which is what we are here to talk about today.    You know, I wasn't going to raise this, but one of my colleagues made such a dramatic statement about his disappointment about something that happened yesterday. I agree, in this regard. There was something that happened yesterday that really appalled me, but it is not the same thing that appalled him. One of our Presidential candidates--you can just fill in the blank--praised the late Iraq dictator, Saddam Hussein. He said, ``You know what he did well? He killed terrorists. They didn't read them their rights. They didn't talk. If they were a terrorist, it was over.''    Now, as I recall--and, Mr. Chair, I would ask unanimous consent to have this article put into the record.    I want to just read from an article dated April 3, 2002, CBS News. It says,        ``Iraq President Saddam Hussein has raised the amount         offered to the relatives of suicide bombers from         $10,000 per family to $25,000, U.S. Defense Secretary         Donald Rumsfeld said Wednesday. Since Iraq upped its         payments last month, 12 suicide bombers have         successfully struck inside Israel, including one man         who killed 25 Israelis, many of them elderly, as they         sat down to a meal at a hotel to celebrate the Jewish         holiday of Passover. The families of three suicide         bombers said they recently received payments of         $25,000.''    So, just for the record, yes, something that I think was disgraceful to American values was any Presidential candidate who would praise Saddam Hussein.    Now, with that said, I am going to ask a question, not on that subject.    Mr. Wexler, I have been very long interested in your analysis of the demographics in the region. And I am told that you did talk about that earlier in your testimony. So my question to you is--and maybe you can just repeat some of that for me--is, what is the incentive for the Palestinians really to not just wait?    Ms. Frankel. Thank you.
