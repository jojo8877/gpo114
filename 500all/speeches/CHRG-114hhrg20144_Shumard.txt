    Ms. Shumard. Hello. I am Ann Shumard and I am the senior curator of photographs at the National Portrait Gallery. And this is one of the Portrait Gallery's and one of the Smithsonian's genuine treasures. It is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln that was taken by Alexander Gardner at Gardner's studio here in Washington, D.C., which was located at the corner of 7th and D Streets, Northwest.    It was taken on February 5 of 1865, just a month before Lincoln's second inaugural. And at the time, of course, that the picture was taken, there was the expectation that there would be many opportunities to photograph the President during his upcoming second term.    The large glass plate negative that was used to produce this print cracked probably when a varnish was applied to it after it was developed, and so just one print was made from this large glass negative before the negative was discarded. It was irreparably damaged.    What, of course, makes this image so evocative, I think, today is the expression that we have on Lincoln's face. This is a man who has seen so much trial and tragedy, but there is that hope, I think, you almost see in that sort of faint smile that the war that has torn the Nation asunder is drawing to a close and there is hope for the future.    The portrait came to the Portrait Gallery's collection in 1981, and it is, as I say, one of the true treasures of our holdings.
