    Mr. Chabot. I thank the Chairman for yielding, and also for holding this very, I think, important and very interesting hearing this afternoon.    It has been mentioned that barriers to free trade in the digital arena have a particularly adverse impact on small businesses, and I happen to be the Chairman of the House Small Business Committee, so I'd just like to ask--give each of the witnesses an opportunity to address what steps should be taken, specifically, to address this adverse impact on small businesses.    And I'll start with you, Mr. Allgeier, Ambassador Allgeier. If that's okay, and I'll just go down the line. If you don't have anything to say, that's okay, too, but----    Mr. Chabot. Thank you.    Dr. Atkinson.    Mr. Chabot. Thank you.    Ms. Espinel.    Mr. Chabot. Thank you.    Mr. Black and Mr. MacCarthy, I've only got about 30 seconds left.    Mr. Chabot. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, is it okay if Mr. MacCarthy answers real quickly?    Mr. Chabot. Thank you.    Mr. Chabot. Thank you.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
