    Ms. Connery. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Cooper, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. Thank you for this opportunity to testify on behalf of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board on the fiscal 2017 budget request.    My name is Joyce Connery, and I have been with the Board for 6 months. I am joined today by two of my fellow Board members, Bruce Hamilton and Sean Sullivan. Bruce and I are both new to the Board this year.    As you may know, the Board is the only agency that provides independent safety oversight to DOE's defense nuclear facilities. These facilities and their operations are essential to our Nation's defense, as noted by the chairman. They perform work that includes the assembly and disassembly of nuclear weapons, surveillance of the stockpile, fabrication of plutonium pits and weapons components, production and recycling of tritium, nuclear criticality experiments, subcritical experiments, and a host of activities to address radioactive legacy waste resulting from 70 years of nuclear weapons operations.    The Board's vitally important oversight mission is achieved with a relatively small budget and a cadre of technical experts. In fiscal year 2017, the Board's budget request is $31 million and supports 120 FTEs . With these resources--and our staff, our people are truly the Board's greatest resource--we will continue to perform independent safety oversight throughout the complex.    Within our oversight responsibilities, we strive to proactively address safety issues at DOE defense nuclear facilities to eliminate threats to public health and safety.    Specifically, we advise DOE and NNSA on the need to effectively integrate safety into the design of new facilities, strengthen the protection of workers through improvements in work planning and conduct of operations, and to improve emergency preparedness and safety culture at sites with defense nuclear facilities.    In recent years, the Board has increased its emphasis on emergency preparedness and response capabilities, making recommendations both complex-wide and site-specific. The complex's aging facilities and resultant backlog of maintenance have created additional concerns. Delays to NNSA's efforts to modernize its infrastructure can exacerbate safety-related issues and require that ongoing work be performed in degrading nuclear facilities that do not meet modern safety standards.    The Board supports DOE and NNSA's efforts to develop new defense facilities, and we will continue to work closely with them to integrate safety into their designs at the earliest possible stages.    While increasing emphasis has been placed on emergency management preparedness and response, I personally have also been concerned with the state of the oversight throughout the defense nuclear complex and staffing challenges at both the Federal and contractor level.    Difficulties retaining proper technical competencies have led to concerns of insufficient Federal safety oversight, and similar concerns on the contractor side impact conduct of operations.    Staffing shortages may be the result of an aging and retiring workforce, competition for highly skilled workers, and compounded by the slow pace of the clearance adjudication process.    Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Cooper, this concludes my opening statement. Thank you again for the opportunity to be here today. We at the Board look forward to our continued work with this subcommittee, and I stand ready to respond to any questions you may have.    Thank you.    Ms. Connery. The complex's aging facilities and resultant backlog of maintenance are continuing safety concerns. Delays to NNSA's efforts to modernize its infrastructure have exacerbated safety related issues and have necessitated that ongoing programmatic work be performed in degrading defense nuclear facilities that do not meet modern safety standards. The Board supports DOE and NNSA's efforts to develop new defense nuclear facilities and will continue to work closely with them to integrate safety into their designs at the earliest stages.    The Board agrees that infrastructure risk can become safety risk. It should be noted, however, that the overall NNSA deferred maintenance backlog of $3.7 billion includes nondefense nuclear facilities and infrastructure that have little or no bearing on the safety of defense nuclear operations. Many of the items in NNSA's deferred maintenance database are roofs, office air conditioning systems, shop utilities, and the like. At some sites these types of deferred maintenance vastly exceed corrective maintenance backlogs or deferred preventive maintenance on nuclear safety-related structures, systems, and components (SSC) and processing equipment. Nevertheless, infrastructure risk in a nondefense nuclear facility can pose a nuclear safety risk under some circumstances.    The number and severity of risks increases when the amount of deferred preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance backlog rises. Each nuclear facility has a Documented Safety Analysis (DSA) and accompanying Technical Safety Requirements which set forth the preventive maintenance and surveillance requirements for the safety class and safety significant SSCs credited in the DSA to prevent or mitigate hazardous accident scenarios. The implementation of these maintenance and surveillance requirements is key to ensuring the SSCs will reliably perform their credited safety functions.    The Board has made maintenance of safety systems and management of aging infrastructure continuing areas of emphasis in recent years. In the past three years, this effort has included on-site reviews of maintenance programs at five NNSA facilities by our staff, multiple visits by Board Members to evaluate maintenance programs and aging infrastructure at the Y-12 National Security Complex and Pantex, public hearings at Pantex and Y-12 which addressed these topics, letters to NNSA on maintenance programs at Pantex (November 12, 2015) and Sandia National Laboratories (May 12, 2014), and a letter to NNSA on the structural integrity of aging production facilities at Y-12 (February 4, 2015). In addition, the Board annually receives a written report and briefing from NNSA on maintaining safety of aging facilities at Y-12 in response to a prior reporting requirement issued by the Board.    Furthermore, the Board has also increased its focus on emergency preparedness and response capabilities, the last line of defense for this aging infrastructure. Hosting both public meetings and hearings, the Board subsequently made several recommendations complex wide and site specific on emergency preparedness and response capability. In September 2014, the Board issued Recommendation 2014-1, Emergency Preparedness and Response, to address deficiencies with DOE's promulgation of and oversight of compliance with requirements. The Board focused staff reviews in 2015 on the assessment of implementation of these requirements at defense nuclear facilities. These assessments included site-specific reviews at the Pantex Plant and Savannah River Site as well as observation of drills and exercises at the Y-12 National Security Complex, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, Pantex Plant, Savannah River Site, and Hanford Site. The review at the Pantex Plant led to the identification of significant issues that warranted near-term resolution. As a result, on November 24, 2015, the Board issued Recommendation 2015-1, Emergency Preparedness and Response at Pantex, to address the identified deficiencies.    Ms. Connery. The Atomic Energy Act, as amended, provides that each Board Member shall have full access to all information relating to the performance of the Board's functions, powers, and mission. I fully support individual Board Members' access to information as interpreted by the Department of Justice in the memo previously provided to this Committee. I agree to be bound by the opinion from the Department of Justice to allow sharing of all information, including information on all Board employees and personnel, necessary for the Board to fulfill its policy making function and its oversight function over the Department of Energy. I further agree with the Atomic Energy Act language that I will not withhold from Board Members, information that is made available to me that relates to the Board's policy and oversight functions. In the sharing of information, I seek the advice of the General Counsel to ensure that the Board complies with the Atomic Energy Act and all other statutory and legal requirements for the protection of information such as the Privacy Act and the protection of classified information.    Ms. Connery. DNFSB took a number of actions in FY 2015 to address employee concerns expressed in the 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) survey results. Examples include: establishment of a working group to adopt agency core values; use of an executive coach on an ongoing basis to develop better communication techniques; regular agency-wide and office staff meetings to provide increased opportunities for employee feedback and participation; and expanded leadership training for its executives. In 2015 DNFSB's FEVS results indicate the agency made notable progress in multiple areas. DNFSB achieved a response rate of 84% (34% higher than the government-wide average) and experienced increases in almost all scores (96%), with 59% of the scores improving by double-digits. I believe this shows the agency is moving in the right direction to address employee concerns, and we will continue to build on these efforts to influence positive change.    Ms. Connery. The Board is the only agency that provides independent safety oversight of the Department of Energy's defense nuclear facilities, ensuring safe operations for the workforce and the public. These facilities and their operations are essential to our Nation's defense, performing work that includes: the assembly, disassembly, and surveillance of nuclear weapons; fabrication of plutonium pits and other weapon components; production and recycling of tritium; nuclear criticality experiments; subcritical experiments; and a host of activities that address the radioactive legacy resulting from 70 years of nuclear weapons operations. In operating the facilities that accomplish these missions, the Department of Energy functions predominantly as a self-regulating entity, responsible for managing cost and schedule as well as safety. The Board was established to provide a needed counterbalance to budgetary and schedule pressures and to serve as an extraordinarily expert technical advisor on matters of safety. The Board has assembled a technical staff of unparalleled capability that consistently identifies safety issues that eluded the Department of Energy and its contractors, enabling the Board to press DOE to correct problems and provide adequate protection to the workers and the public. Recent examples of the Board's contributions to safety include the Board's identification of the following major safety issues:    <bullet>  Systemic problems in DOE's readiness to respond to emergencies at its sites which had persisted unaddressed despite the wakeup call of Fukushima Daiichi--The Secretary of Energy accepted the Board's recommendation and issued an implementation plan that commits to corrective actions including a complex-wide assessment of problems and a rewrite of DOE's governing directive, DOE Order 151.1C, Comprehensive Emergency Management System.    <bullet>  Dysfunction of Los Alamos National Laboratory's criticality safety program, including the exodus of the laboratory's criticality safety staff--In response, the Laboratory Director paused all work involving fissile materials at the Los Alamos Plutonium Facility and initiated corrective actions including rebuilding the lab's criticality safety expertise, reevaluating the criticality safety evaluations for fissile material operations, and gradually reestablishing the lab's ability to safely perform fissile material operations through a comprehensive series of readiness assessments.    <bullet>  DOE's failure to manage the upkeep of the software code RADCALC, which is used to determine the type of packaging needed for safe shipment of various radioactive materials--In response, DOE alerted users to suspend use of the noncompliant software, audited the responsible vendor and issued a stop work order based on the audit's results, and initiated an extent of condition review for similar software.    <bullet>  Improper analysis and control of flammable gas hazards in the Defense Waste Processing Facility, which converts high-level radioactive wastes into glass in a high-temperature melter--In response, DOE instituted compensatory measures to place the facility in a safe condition, formed a dedicated team to resolve the safety issues, and began the development of a new flowsheet for the facility to address the hazard.    <bullet>  Failure of the design strategy for Hanford's Waste Treatment Plant to properly prevent erosion and plugging of process piping that DOE plans to rely on for transfers of highly radioactive slurries for decades without maintenance--DOE plans to address this issue through systematic evaluation of hazards, reassessing the pipeline design strategy, performing additional erosion testing, and establishing appropriate waste acceptance criteria for the facilities.    In addition to identifying safety issues of such magnitude, the Board also assists DOE in characterizing safety concerns and developing avenues for improvement. In the past year, for example, the Board provided an informational report to DOE that systematically evaluated the structures of aging facilities at the Y-12 National Security Complex, to assist DOE in making informed decisions regarding the potential to use those facilities for programmatic work for several more decades. Likewise, the Board provided a major report to DOE on opportunities to reduce the quantity of radioactive material-at-risk in the Los Alamos Plutonium Facility, to reduce the hazard posed by this facility to workers and the surrounding communities.    Without the expertise and needed external perspective provided by the Board, the Department of Energy would have a significantly reduced capacity to identify and resolve safety issues at its defense nuclear facilities.                                 ______
