    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very briefly.    Welcome back and welcome, good to see you both here. As we look toward this focus in rebalance toward the Asia Pacific it is impossible to talk about this without talking about South Asia, so this focus of the hearing today is so critical.    As we look around the world at different hotspots and different areas of concern and emerging and growing threats, I think the relative stability overall that we see in the region, I think, comes from the fact that there is this proactive engagement from a strategic sense, from a cultural sense as well as an economic sense, and I think that is connecting each of these three things.    Connecting our people, our businesses, our militaries is what is critical for us as we look at moving forward and really building this strong partnership. Obviously the India-U.S. relationship and really growing friendship is one of the most important elements of this, so I look forward to hearing from you today. Thank you.
