    Mr. Lance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Good morning to the panel.    Commissioner O'Rielly, I believe there is a good deal of room for criticism of the net-neutrality order. And I ask you what message you believe this sends internationally when our government asserts such authority over the Internet. Are you at all concerned that other nations, including some repressive regimes, could get the wrong idea about America's commitment to free speech and free expression online?    Mr. Lance. Thank you.    Mr. Pai, do you have an opinion on that?    Mr. Lance. Thank you.    Chairman Wheeler, you stated your intent to commence a rulemaking to promulgate rules, quote, to clarify the FCC's expanded privacy authority under the new Internet rules and that you would hope that this would be forthcoming this fall.    Could you please update us on that, given the timeframe?    Mr. Lance. Congress misses deadlines all the time, so----    Mr. Lance. Thank you.    Are there other members--Mr. Pai?    Mr. Lance. Yes, I tend to agree with that.    Would other members of the Commission like to comment?    Commissioner Rosenworcel?    Mr. Lance. Yes. Thank you.    Commissioner Clyburn?    Mr. Lance. Commissioner O'Rielly?    Mr. Lance. Thank you. I think we will continue to monitor this, and I thank you for your testimony.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
