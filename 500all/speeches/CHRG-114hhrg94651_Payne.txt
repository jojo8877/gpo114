    Mr. PAYNE. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and to the Ranking Member. Kind of along that line, Mr. Iyer, this question really goes to customer service and the possibility of hidden fees and what have you. What recourse does a person have with peer-to-peer lending sites when something goes wrong?    Mr. PAYNE. The borrower.    Mr. PAYNE. That is what I was getting at.    Mr. PAYNE. Has there been any research done in economic demographics of most lenders, the types of businesses they fund, and in what geographic areas?    Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Renton, we heard earlier on the average, eight percent of business loan applications are accepted in the peer-to-peer platform. Can you elaborate on why you think that may be the case, and what can we do to increase that number, if you think it should be increased.    Mr. PAYNE. That is sort of the interesting aspect of this, how does someone get started. Your point was you needed five years but you only had three. How do you overcome that obstacle, Mr. Green?    Mr. PAYNE. I was going to mention that, in your case, you are fortunate that you came up with a great idea, and something that is necessary and useful in society. Has that made it a bit easier for you to have people kind of go along with investing?    Mr. PAYNE. Thank you. I yield back.
