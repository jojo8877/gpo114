    Mr. Abraham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is my pleasure to recognize Hon. Tom Schedler, the Secretary of State from the great State of Louisiana. Secretary Schedler was appointed to the position in 2010 and was reelected in 2011 to serve a four-year term. He is past President of the National Association of Secretaries of State with his term ending this past July. And he served as Co-Chairman for the National Association of Secretaries of State Task Force on Emergency Preparedness for Elections.    As Secretary of State of Louisiana, he is committed to protecting and defending the integrity of every election in the State and has worked diligently to streamline the election process. The result is been a more efficient and cost-effective system with Louisiana becoming one of the first States to implement online voter registration and the first State in the country to launch a smartphone app for voters to use to get timely election information. My pleasure for you to be here.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Abraham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And we'll get back on track here.     Secretary Schedler, let's go to the 30,000 foot view. In your opinion is the integrity and the security of the voting systems in all States--you being the past President of the Secretaries of State, you have I think some knowledge of the subject. You think it's good, bad, average?    Mr. Abraham. Thank you.    Mr. Abraham. I'm out of time, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
