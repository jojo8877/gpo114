    Mr. Clawson. Thank you for coming today and sharing your time and expertise, and I really appreciate it, and I am looking forward to what you have to say about security in the region.    You know, as I read about this process, it feels unclear to me that we are going to be more secure tomorrow than we are today on either side of the conflict, and that really is the bottom line. If more people die because of this process, then what are we doing? So I am really interested to hear what you all have to say about everybody's security. There is just too much dying. Thank you.
