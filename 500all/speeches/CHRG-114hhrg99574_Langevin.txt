    Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to thank our witnesses here today.    If I could, I would like to change tack a bit and ask about another threat that is facing our surface transportation system, and that is relating to cyber attack. So, Mr. Mayenschein, can you just give us a brief overview of TSA's actions in this domain?    Mr. Langevin. I think it is important, especially when you look at things like skid attacks. The same type of system that governs pumps and balances is the same thing that governs the switches and such to keep trains on track or to change track and such and could obviously be potentially penetrated.    Can you also describe TSA's role in developing guidance for the transportation sector as it relates to the NIST Cyber Framework?    Mr. Langevin. Sure. I would like to do some follow-up on that then.    Mr. Langevin. Mr. Diaz, Ms. Hanson, can you describe how you view the cybersecurity risk to your respective organizations? How do you go about making risk-management decisions? Do you feel that you have adequate in-house resources of information security? Whom do you partner with to help protect your assets?    Mr. Langevin. Ms. Hanson.    Mr. Langevin. Thank you.    Mr. Mayenschein, going back to you again, how does TSA handle reports of cybersecurity intrusions and events? Do they count as security incidents? Are they reported to the TSOC and entered into the WebEOC system? Does TSA have any additional steps it takes for cyber incidents as compared to more traditional security events?    Mr. Langevin. I would also like to know what happens once the cyber incident is reported, what is the follow-up? How do you ensure that the vulnerability is closed?    Mr. Langevin. Ms. Grover, do you have anything to add?    Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
