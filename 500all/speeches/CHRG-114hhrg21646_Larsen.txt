    Mr. Larsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you and the subcommittee for allowing me to sit in since I am on the full committee but not on the subcommittee. I want to say thanks.    I want to thank General Jackson and the Army Corps team for your work as well, the local folks on the Puget Sound Nearshore Ecosystem Restoration Project, and our Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, as well those who worked with you on this, for their work on the study.    This is going to be one of the largest habitat restoration efforts in the U.S. It is integral to our own State's Puget Sound Action Agenda, which includes recovery and protection of several fish and mammal species and the fulfillment of tribal treaty rights.    As Congress continues to work towards WRDA, I am encouraged by the progress being made on this particular report and pleased to see the report recommends construction authorization for the three tier 1 projects. You mentioned four, but you split the North Fork Skagit into two: so the Duckabush River Estuary, the Nooksack River Delta, and North Fork Skagit River Delta.    Together these projects improve title exchanges, restore freshwater tidelands, improve sound restoration activities, among other things.    I just would ask that given the importance as well of tier 2 projects at the overall restoration, I strongly support the inclusion of the tier 2 projects as well in the final Chief's Report, along with these tier 1 projects.    But I do want to, if I could, ask unanimous consent to include my full statement for the record, which also includes, Mr. Chairman, a letter I signed along with the Members of the Washington State Delegation who have districts abutting the Puget Sound, representing our complete support for this Chief's Report.    Mr. Larsen. And in closing, I would like to reiterate the importance of this restoration project to the entire Puget Sound region and look forward to the Army Corps.    So with that, before I yield back, I have a couple more minutes and I will not take long. I have just one question for General Jackson.    Could you clarify the timeline for the Chief's signature on this?    General Jackson. Yes, Congressman. We have provided the Chief the report for him to review. He is out of the country. He is on his way back. He will be back late tonight. We are going to sit down and review it with him tomorrow and make sure he does not have any questions. He could sign it as early as sometime tomorrow.    Depending on how he wants to synthesize the information, it may take a few days, but we are going to press him to get it done as soon as possible. He is committed to doing that.    Mr. Larsen. Where is he? And does he have Skype?    General Jackson. I think he is over the Atlantic right now, sir. So unless he is logged into the Gogo in flight, I am not sure if I can get him.    Mr. Larsen. All right.    General Jackson. But we will hit him as soon as he lands.    Mr. Larsen. Well, you understand my urgency. I appreciate it. Thank you so much.    And I yield back.
