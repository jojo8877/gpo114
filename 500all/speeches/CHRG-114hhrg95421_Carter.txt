    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Roth, thank you for being here. I want to get at something that is bothering me throughout these series of hearings that we have had on this. And it seems to be the culture, if you will, of the Secret Service about reporting. We have been told, and it has been alleged, that the watch commander actually said that he did not want to report this, he didn't want to ask for a field sobriety test because it would have been a career killer. Is that true?    Mr. Carter. When he says a career killer, is he referring to his career for reporting it or is he referring to their career if they had been found guilty? I am not sure----    Mr. Carter. Tell me what the policy is. What is the policy at the Secret Service when someone does--recognizes or when someone is faced with this situation. Are they, you are required to report, or is it you better just keep it quiet?    Mr. Carter. And if you don't report it, what is the punishment?    Mr. Carter. It would appear to me that that's an important component.    Mr. Carter. Okay. I am still a little disappointed, not in you, but just in that--it would appear to me that that would be cut and dry.    Mr. Carter. Let me ask you about the two agents who were involved. When they arrived at that White House complex, the officers that stopped them asked them where are you coming from.    Mr. Carter. And their answer was?    Mr. Carter. And that turns out to be a blatant lie.    Mr. Carter. Okay. Then what is the consequences of that? Look, we teach our children there are consequences to actions. This was an action. What is the consequence?    Mr. Carter. I appreciate that, and I understand what you are trying to do. But let me ask you this: What is going to happen to them?    Mr. Carter. Within those written laws, is one of the options to go ahead and retire?    Mr. Carter. Does it go on their permanent record?    Mr. Carter. Is that shared with a prospective employer in the future? If one of them goes to get--you know, in the private sector, do you tell them, okay, this is what happened? Or do you just tell them, no, they were employed here from this day to this day?    Mr. Carter. Obviously in this.    Mr. Carter. I understand. But my point is, the concern that I have is just with the general culture that exists in the Secret Service at this time.    Mr. Carter. Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
