    Mr. Barr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    With respect to H.R. 3340, Mr. Emmer's Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act, of which I am a cosponsor, and I appreciate the leadership of Mr. Emmer on this important transparency measure, my question to the witnesses is in response to Mr. Stanley's argument for the need for political independence. I believe Mr. Stanley's phrase was the reason why FSOC's funding is not subject to the appropriations process or congressional review of how these fees are used is the need for political independence.    Of course in the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson talked about the fact that governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the government. And I think Mr. Jefferson as a Founder of our country would be troubled to find that so many of the regulatory agencies in our country are not instituted among the American people based on the consent of the governed, but instead on this principle of the need for political independence. That, to me, resembles more the institutions that we saw in the Soviet Union instead of a democratic society where governing entities are subject to the consent of the people.    I would be interested to hear from the witnesses about Mr. Stanley's argument for the need for political independence and why more transparency is not a good idea.    Dr. Kupiec?    Mr. Barr. Mr. Ireland?    Mr. Barr. Mr. Stanley, why is it that the American people shouldn't expect accountability to them through their elected Representatives in Congress?    Mr. Barr. Thank you, Mr. Stanley.    Since my time is expiring, if the witnesses could also speak to Mr. Stanley's argument with the TAILOR Act as to his assertion that the existing regulations already tailor, and what about the inadequacy of those existing tailoring efforts by the regulators?    Dr. Kupiec?    Mr. Barr. My time has expired. I'm sorry. We won't be able to get to that question.    Thank you. I yield back.
