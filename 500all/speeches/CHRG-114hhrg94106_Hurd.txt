    Mr. Hurd. I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas and you here today. I appreciate you all coming here.    I know the difficulty of the task that you all are charged with having spent 9 years as an undercover officer in the CIA, chasing al-Qaeda and the Taliban and places like that--organizations like that. I know the difficulty and--I know that the people in your--the men and women in your organizations are operating as if it is September 12, 2001. Please, when you go back to your organizations, thank them for all of their hard work on behalf of us.    When I was in Pakistan, Afghanistan, you know, the bad guys would push their message through night letters. At night, they would drop letters on people's doorsteps. Now, they have social media, and all three of you will have highlighted that in your testimony and in the documents that you submitted.    My question is--is what efforts--who is coordinating the effort to counter that ideology on social media and these other elements? You know, 20 percent of any counter-insurgency is cutting off the head of the snake, 80 percent is addressing the underlying concerns.    Who is leading that? What are you guys doing in each one of your agencies to counter that?    Mr. Hurd. Thank you.    Mr. Hurd. Thank you. Next question is two parts.    Again, when I was, you know, in the intelligence community and operating an alias, I would frequently travel to a lot of countries, and I never ended up going to that end destination. I would go somewhere else driving because it was a lot easier. So, you know, the concept of broken travel.    What are you all doing in order to monitor the broken travel of folks that may end up going to Syria, but don't go directly there, drive in? The other issue is, what new intelligence capabilities do we need in Syria in order for you all better do your job back here?    Mr. Hurd. I think they covered it sufficiently. I yield back.
