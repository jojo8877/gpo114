    Mr. Aderholt. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, it is good to be here today and for this hearing. Thank you for mentioning what we do down in Alabama. We appreciate the way to mention Huntsville and also Birmingham.    I met with the folks, some of the folks, from the Birmingham facility just recently and one of things that we talked about, and they had mentioned to me was that the new iPhone, the new iPhone 6s, have an encryption in it that you cannot get into the--they are encrypted and there is no back door key.    And just wanted to know what--and, of course, this is different from their predecessors, the other phones you were able to get into--what is your--or what is the FBI's position on Apple and Google's decision both to encrypt these smart phones?    Mr. Aderholt. So, you know, you mention about the mother shows you the phone and say you cannot get into it, what programs had it affected and can you just let us know the damage that it has done to the FBI?    Mr. Aderholt. Do you need additional resources to work on this, or what can we, as this committee, do or as Congress do to try to help you with this?    Mr. Aderholt. So if I understand you, it is really not a matter of resources, it is really just a legislative fix overall that really that this needs to be dealt with.    Mr. Aderholt. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Aderholt. Let me add there, if I understand it was Apple voluntarily made this decision to fix it so the user is able to lock it and they are not able to unlock it.    Mr. Aderholt. Great question. If I could follow up one more question. Has there been any, that you heard of, there is a rumor that Apple has made an agreement with China about this as a pre-condition to selling their phones there.
