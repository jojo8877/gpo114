    Mr. Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Actually Ms. Bordallo asked my question about the sequester and coming up on this month and just want to express my concern that we continue to work with you and the committee on coming up with a strategy--I think O-FRP is a good start--to deal with a tough budget situation.    But we need to get back to a situation where we are doing regular budgets over more than a year, so that there is more dependability and more ability to plan. I want you to know that I have that in mind. Thank you for being with us today.
