    Mrs. Maloney. Thank you.    I am trying to get this straight. OPM was breached directly. Is that correct? And I am going to ask Ms. Seymour, the information officer. OPM was breached twice directly. Is that correct?    Mrs. Maloney. And one was in--one occurred in December of 2014, detected in April 2015. And then the security breach--when were the two breaches? When were the two breaches? The dates?    Mrs. Maloney. You discovered it in March 2014?    Mrs. Maloney. November 2013. Okay. And then the second breach was when? There were two breaches, correct?    Mrs. Maloney. June of 2014.    Mrs. Maloney. Who discovered this breach? How did OPM discover this breach?    Mrs. Maloney. So you did not discover it. The Department of Homeland Security discovered it?    Mrs. Maloney. In 2014. Wait a minute. I think this is important. Homeland Security discovered it.    Mrs. Maloney. Okay. And then the second one, who discovered it?    Mrs. Maloney. Now, when did you report these breaches, and who did you report them to?    Mrs. Maloney. Who?    Mrs. Maloney. You did it to DHS. Did you report it to Congress?    Mrs. Maloney. Okay. That was the April 15 one. What about the first one?    Mrs. Maloney. When?    Mrs. Maloney. Would you please get that back to the committee for us?    Mrs. Maloney. Did you notify the contractors of the breach?    Mrs. Maloney. But the breaches were direct. Now, I want to understand the interaction with the contractors. Now, when they breached you, did it go into OPM? I am asking both Mr. Hess and Mr. Giannetta. When they went into your system, did that connect into OPM, or was it held in your system?    Mrs. Maloney. So it was within your system. So the 4 million identities that they have and information they have, it came from OPM, or it came from the contractors? Are they one and the same, or are they separate? And I will go back to Ms. Seymour.    Mrs. Maloney. What I would like to get in writing is exactly what information came out of OPM, what information came out of the contractors. Is it the one and the same? You are the final database. So I want to understand the connection and how the breaches occurred and how they interconnected. If you could get it back to Chairman Chaffetz, I think it is important information.
