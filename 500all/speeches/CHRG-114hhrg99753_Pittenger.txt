    Mr. Pittenger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And I thank each of you for being with us today.    I would like to thank Congressman Emmer for his role on the FSOC reform bill, particularly as it relates to the budget process or lack thereof and the need for greater transparency and accountability.    Dr. Kupiec, do you believe that there is any limitation at all in the funding opportunities for FSOC and OFR?    Mr. Pittenger. Could they, for example, double their budgets every year if they wanted to?    Mr. Pittenger. How about disclosures? Do they disclose less information than comparable entities like the Fed?    Mr. Pittenger. Mr. Ireland, would you like to comment?    Mr. Pittenger. How about openness as it relates to public notice of meetings? Are they required to give any public notice?    Mr. Pittenger. Mr. Kupiec, do you have any comments?    Mr. Pittenger. Thank you very much. My time has expired.
