    Mr. Perry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for not being here up front.    I was next door at another committee hearing, and I hope to get to some questions but I think it is important for the record to give some people a sense of history they might not know because we have people in this country and around the world that are apologists for what Russia and other similar nations and viewpoints are doing and so I think it is important to reflect on the past and know that this has been going on--this is nothing new.    And so I am just going to read--this is out of a book published in 1986, I think, called ``The Harvest of Sorrow'' and it is in regard to the terror famine forced on Ukraine by the USSR and Russia.    So the first passage is--that I will read,        ``And even more striking or at least a more important         aspect of the psychopathy of Stalinism may be seen in         the fact that no word about the famine was allowed to         appear in the press or elsewhere. People who referred         to it were subject to arrest for anti-Soviet         propaganda, usually getting 5 or more years in labor         camps.''    And then,          ``Hitler approvingly calls the big lie. He knew that         even when the truth may be readily available, the         deceiver need not give up.          ``He saw that the flat denial on one hand and the         injection into the pool of information of the corpus of         positive falsehood on the other were sufficient to         confuse the issue for the passively uninstructed         foreign audience and to induce acceptance of the         Stalinist version of those actively seeking to be         deceived,''and I have got a few more here that I found interesting.    This is in regard to a gentleman named Walter Duranty who reported or failed to report or misreported on the famine of the time who was working for the New York Times. This passage says that        ``What the American public got was not the straight         stuff but the false reporting. Its influence was         enormous and long-lasting.''    Furthermore, regarding Duranty, who was a Pulitzer Prize winner for the New York Times based on his work in Ukraine, the praise which went to Duranty was, clearly, not due to a desire to know the truth but, rather, a desire--to a desire of many to be told what they wished to hear and, of course, his own motives needed no explaining.    One communist gave as the reason or one of the reasons for the suppression of the truth the fact that the USSR could not only win the support of workers in the capitalist countries if the human cost of its policies was concealed.    So I do have a little time for some questions and that is just part of the historical perspective of what has been refined over time, and Americans and free people around the globe must be--must be apprised of this and must be aware of it and must be prepared to fight for their freedoms because if they don't will fall prey to the same thing.    I am going to just say Peter, if that is okay with you, the question I think I have for you and I apologize if it has already been asked, there are reports of think tanks becoming puppets of Putin, and I think you have identified the Institute for Democracy and Cooperation in New York as one in particular, if that is true.    What is the strategy behind co-opting these think tanks? Is the strategy working?    Mr. Perry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield.
