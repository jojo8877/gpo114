    Mr. HUELSKAMP. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the topic of this hearing, and I am looking for some accountability, and I appreciate your work on that.    I want to follow up on the issue of improper payments. I think in multiple reports your office found that SBA is currently understating its improper payment rate. Can you describe that more fully for the Committee, or at least summarize what is in your report and whether we have seen any steps at the SBA to fix this problem?    Mr. HUELSKAMP. But at the beginning, if I might interrupt, at the beginning, though, they were denying those high rates, so I did not follow----    Mr. HUELSKAMP. But at the beginning, when you came in, you were using SBA data or did you go back and pull more information separately?    Mr. HUELSKAMP. Do you think that is at the administrator level? What about kind of the upper midlevel management, the folks that likely a year from now will still be there even though a new administrator? Have they somehow agreed with you all's assessment and the actual data mining that it takes to generate this type of rate and understanding of it?    Mr. HUELSKAMP. What is the penalty for noncompliance?    Mr. HUELSKAMP. No, for SBA, if they do not reach----    Mr. HUELSKAMP. Well, thank you. Chairman, I am out of time. I yield back. Thank you.
