    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a couple questions for Mr. Rogers. In your testimony you comment that in a post-Dodd-Frank world, the Commission has adopted rules for data reporting that have changed how we view the markets. Specifically, can you talk a little bit about the transparency to market participants? Give me an example of that and what do you believe are some of the most significant gains in these efforts. And with respect to SDR data quality, do we plan to continue building upon this progress and how will we do that?    Mr. Aguilar. I appreciate it. One more for you. The regulators, the global regulators working on this through the data harmonization working group to propose guidelines for harmonizing the derivatives data across the jurisdictions, work streams are taking place on data elements such as unique trade identification, unique product identification, and other data elements. Once the working group puts out its recommendations expected later this year, how will CFTC respond? Will it use these recommendations? What do you think are some of the next steps, and do you envision that there will be changes that are needed based on that work?    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Mr. Lucas is not here, Mr. LaMalfa?
