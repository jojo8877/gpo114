    Mr. Neugebauer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Chair Yellen, thank you for being here today. Over the last few years, there has been a lot of discussion about a financial institution being systemically important, and Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank sets an arbitrary threshold of $50 billion. That designation then triggers an enhanced prudential standards.    Of course, as you and I have discussed, I am not a big fan of the SIFI designation because I believe it is an implicit designation of an institution being too-big-to-fail. And with that said, the $50 billion threshold that is currently in place isn't, I don't think, in my estimation, and I think a lot of other people's, really working because it places an undue burden on the mid-sized banks that aren't systemic to meet additional enhanced standards. And so, I want to applaud Congressmen Luetkemeyer and Stivers for their leadership in this issue.    As you know, this month the Office of Financial Research (OFR) released a study examining, I think it is called systemic important indicators. It looked at five factors: size; interconnectedness; substitutability; complexity; and cross-jurisdictional activity. This came out of the Basel Committee, as you are aware.    So does the Federal Reserve agree that these five factors that were used by the Basel Committee are the primary indicators of a financial institution's systemic importance?    Mr. Neugebauer. But basically the parameters that you have only let you determine what happens to people in the box. It does not let you determine who is and who isn't in the box, and when you look at that study, what you realize is one of the least of the companies that has been determined to be systemic--there is a huge range between the firms that are larger and not systemic.    I think if you look at that chart--and I am sure you have seen--we have a big gap there, and that big gap is problematic, and I think a lot of people think that we need to do better in that area. So if you think these standards are acceptable, then would you be receptive to accepting a different arrangement where you use standards that have been adopted by Basel, and if you--if the Fed has additional standards that you would like to include in that, so that everybody would know whether they were in the box or out of the box.    Mr. Neugebauer. The statute doesn't allow you now to draw that line. The line is drawn for you, and so--    Mr. Neugebauer. --do I hear you saying that you think that is a flawed process?    Mr. Neugebauer. So, requirements is what you should be drawing upon; is that what you are saying?    Mr. Neugebauer. No, you said it was arbitrary, so should we not draw the line?
