    Mr.  Connolly. Mr. Chairman, I promise I am just going to take a minute----    Mr.  Connolly . Because I can't come back.    Mr.  Connolly. I thank the chair.    I just want to say to my friend from Alabama with whom I recently traveled to China, I can tell you that my constituents would answer his question. We need to be engaged. This is a very important part of the world where we cannot afford to retreat and withdraw. And it is always a false choice to say to us we can either afford domestic investment or foreign aid but not both. I mean, it sounds good, but we are talking about less than 1 percent of the United States budget, and it is a tool that helps us avoid military engagement and that can have long-term return on it. So it is an investment worth making if the United States is going to live up to its responsibilities as an engaged world power.    I thank the chair.
