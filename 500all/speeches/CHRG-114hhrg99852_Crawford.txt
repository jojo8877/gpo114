    Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Sims, Kermit, Texas, I am not entirely unfamiliar with west Texas, but I know it is a small town, and most of us on the Agriculture Committee know a little something about small towns.    Do you actually live in town, or do you live out in the country?    Mr. Crawford. More rural?    Mr. Crawford. I got you.    Are you on well water? Are you on the municipal water supply?    Mr. Crawford. Well water? You ever have an experience of contaminated ground water?    Mr. Crawford. Interesting. It is one of those things that the media seems to pay an awful lot of attention to, but it seems to be overblown. Would you agree?    Mr. Crawford. Interesting. Let me move on to another, probably historically, and you tell me if I am wrong here, but in the oil industry the blue collar workers that you employ, have employed over time, part of the training they receive, on-the-job training, is that safe to say?    Mr. Crawford. As technology is advancing, are you seeing more of a need for a little more workforce education in the oil fields?    Mr. Crawford. So it is pretty labor intensive, but as your workforce advances and technology advances, obviously, some educational components are there?    Mr. Crawford. In your communities, do you have community colleges that are potential partners for a workforce education that could serve your industry?    Mr. Crawford. Are you involved in helping develop curriculum so you can expedite the workforce education?    Mr. Crawford. Excellent. So in more ways than one, it is not strictly a manual labor opportunity, but it is an advancement opportunity that pays dividends in the community, is that safe to say?    Mr. Crawford. Excellent. I appreciate you being here.    And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
