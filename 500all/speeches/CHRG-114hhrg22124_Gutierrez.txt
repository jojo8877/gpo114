    Mr. Gutierrez. Thank you. I would like to note that we are not having a hearing today about gun violence, 500 people shot dead in Chicago, 3,000 this year; we are not having a hearing about police killing unarmed civilians; we are not having a hearing about the need for immigration reform or detention centers; we are not having a hearing about any of the really important things. We are having a hearing about a Donald Trump talking point that one he goes to again and again, the one he says that immigrants are killers, rapists, drug dealers, who are here to hurt people, not to build up our country like every other immigrant group that has come before them.    Today we are focusing on one of America's great cities, a city with a troubling past when it comes to respecting civil rights and building trust between the police and the community at large. And so I would think that we would want to work on building that trust between the police and the people, and that the efforts taken by people to build that trust shouldn't be undermined.    Lastly, I am just going to say, because it doesn't really matter, this hearing, it really doesn't. It is going to come and go. You guys got somebody to pay for your trips to come down here. It is not going to have an impact on anything. We are not going to change anything. This is just another political hearing.    But I just want to say that, you know, we could have actually spoken to a lot of very important issues that people want us to talk about, but it always seems the majority always says we should listen to people that are not in Washington, D.C., we should listen to local elected officials, that that is where democracy is blooming, but it seems like every time you guys say anything, they have an objection when they don't like it.    So having said that, I just want to say to my colleague from New Orleans, I would like to yield the remaining 3 minutes of my time to Mr. Richmond to ask questions.
