    Mr. Webster. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having this hearing.    And I want to take my time just to thank General Jackson for presenting the Post-Authorization Change Report for the Picayune Strand restoration project authorized in 2007 and redesigned post Hurricane Katrina. The project will restore 55,000 acres of former residential unit in southwest Florida.    The completed project will deliver restoration benefits to 170,000 acres in Western Everglades, including downstream the Ten Thousand Islands Estuary and neighboring preserves, which will reap the benefits of the restoration with natural sheet flow.    In addition, the project will enhance the protection recovery of the iconic, though sometimes imperiled, Florida species, including the Florida panther, the wood stork and the Florida manatee. Inclusion in this change report and WRDA 2016 will be a significant milestone for the Western Everglades.    I am grateful for Army Corps and for the South Florida Water Management District for their substantial investment in resources to date and ongoing commitment to completing this component of the comprehensive Everglades restoration plan.    Thank you very much. I yield back.
