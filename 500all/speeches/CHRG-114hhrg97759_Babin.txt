    Mr. Babin. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome all of you panelists. We appreciate and it's very, very fascinating to hear your testimony.    In my district, Texas 36, the Johnson Space Center Astromaterials Curation facility provides the services for all return planetary materials that do not require planetary protection laboratories. This facility has been in operation since the Apollo lunar samples were returned. In the next decades we anticipate missions to collect samples from the Moon, from Mars, from comets, and from asteroids. Each of these new sample collections will require new curation laboratories while the facilities for the older collections will require routine maintenance and upgrades.    Samples to be returned from Mars pose even greater challenges due to special planetary protection requirements. Dr. Stofan, what steps is NASA taking to upgrade its curation facilities and protect against the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to celestial bodies, which may harbor life?    Mr. Babin. Thank you very much.    And this is directed to everyone. What proportion of astrobiology research in the United States is funded directly or indirectly by NASA? Does anyone know? Okay.    Mr. Babin. Um-hum.    Mr. Babin. Okay.    Mr. Babin. Absolutely. Okay. And also what are the most important technological advancements that are needed to further astrobiology research and what advancements should be our highest priority to continue this?    Mr. Babin. Thank you.    Mr. Babin. Right, thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Thank you, panelists.
