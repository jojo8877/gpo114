    Mr. Mullin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to start with Mr. Ivy, and I know these two may not actually go together, but in practical and legal terms, which those are the two I am talking about, is it better for the development of advanced grid technology to be managed at the local or State levels?    Mr. Mullin. Thank you.    Mr. Kamen, you made a point in your written testimony that more than 50 percent of the generating capacity in the U.S. is 30 years old, and at 70 percent of the 280,000 miles of transmission line is more than 25 years old. What do you feel your company, as well as other companies like yours bring to the table in addressing this issue?    Mr. Mullin. Unless it is antique. You have to hold onto those.    Mr. Mullin. Wow.    Mr. Mullin. What is keeping it down? What is keeping the companies from being able to do this? Are we the hindrance?    Mr. Mullin. Does anybody else on the panel want to address that? What is holding the industry back?    Voice. I sense they do, but----    Mr. Mullin. Yes. I am the good guy, I am not going to hurt you, but I need. Look, I come from a business, and the only reason why I am here is because the biggest problem I had with running our company was rules that were being made up here.    Mr. Mullin. And so I understand it, but I need to know what it is that is holding you back so we can help.    Mr. Mullin. Thank you.    My time is out.
