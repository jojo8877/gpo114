    Mr. Ribble. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And, Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here. And my question is in relationship to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I know you have been involved related to exit permit suspensions. Could you tell us what we could do here in the Congress to facilitate the State Department's work to help these families gets their children home?
