    Mr. Cohen. If you want to go, I will go, or I will come back.    Mr. Cohen. Thank you.    Director Comey, are there limitations that you could see in permitting the FBI or government in a court to look into certain records, certain type of cases, certain type of circumstances that you could foresee, or do you want it open for any case where there could be evidentiary value?    Mr. Cohen. But if we decided to pass a statute and we thought it should be limited in some way, maybe to terrorism or maybe to something where it's a reasonable expectation that a person's life is in jeopardy or that you could apprehend somebody who has taken somebody's life, have you thought about any limits?    Because, you know, under what you are saying, you go to a court, I mean, you could go to a court for cases that are not capital cases, and that's--I don't think anybody here--what the public is fascinated or riveted on is the fact that what happened in San Bernardino was so awful, and if we can find some communication or some list that was in the cloud that these people contacted, you know, Osama bin Laden's cousin and that they get--and find out that he has something to do with it, then that's important. But if you are talking about getting into somebody's information to find out who they sold, you know, 2 kilos or two bags or whatever is a whole different issue.    Where would you limit it if you were coming up with a statute that could satisfy both your interest in the most extreme, important cases and yet satisfy privacy concerns?    Mr. Cohen. Thank you. Because I am slow in getting up there to vote and the Republicans hit the--real quickly, I am going to yield back the balance of my time and start to walk fast.
