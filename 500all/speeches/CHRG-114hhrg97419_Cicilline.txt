    Mr. Cicilline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you to the witnesses for this very useful testimony, as we sort of struggle with this question of how do we preserve cross-border data flows, and if we're really making the point of how important this is to our economy, and how unsustainable a system that interrupts those flows would be in the long term.    And you've all spoken about the need for a narrowly-crafted, but least-restrictive-of-trade kind of standard. And I want to sort of press you a little bit on that, and beginning with you, Mr. Ambassador. You make the same argument, of course, in your written testimony that we need a workable, and commercially-viable and legally-valid alternative to the Safe Harbor provision.    I wonder if you could just expand on this a little bit, and describe what you think should be included in such an alternative. And also, how do your member companies plan to take privacy concerns into account until such a new standard is developed?    Mr. Cicilline. Does anyone else have a suggestion? Yes. Dr. Atkinson.    Mr. Cicilline. May I just follow up, Dr. Atkinson. One thing you said in your written testimony is that the European Court of Justice overturned the Safe Harbor agreement, not because of privacy concerns, but because of concerns about governmental access. Does it then sort of follow that either as part of the Safe Harbor, the new agreement, or in conjunction with it that we put into place additional surveillance reforms to respond to that concern raised by the court? Sort of building on Judge----    Mr. Cicilline. And just one final question for the panel. Does Congress have a role to play, and if so, what is it, in establishing this sort of modernized Safe Harbor framework? Is there a useful role that Congress can play in the development of that?    Mr. Cicilline. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
