    Mr. Castro. Sure. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you and the ranking member for all of your work on this issue. Yesterday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated that North Korea's offensive cyber operations, growing stockpile of ballistic missiles, and nuclear weapons pose ``A serious threat to the United States and to the security environment in East Asia.''    My amendment echoes Director Clapper's assessment by adding a sense of Congress that North Korea's nuclear ballistic missiles program are of mutual concern to the United States, Japan, and South Korea, and that trilateral cooperation is essential to the security of each Nation and the stability of Asia-Pacific Region. Last December, the United States, Japan, and South Korea finalized a trilateral military intelligence-sharing agreement concerning threats posed by North Korea. The United States has had bilateral agreements with Japan and South Korea, but this is a new trilateral agreement that creates a more effective bulwark against North Korea and strengthens our collective response capabilities the event of future aggression from North Korea.    The United States, Japan, and South Korea share the values of democratic governance and the rule of law and respect for human rights. It makes sense that we share intelligence related to North Korea's military threats.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
