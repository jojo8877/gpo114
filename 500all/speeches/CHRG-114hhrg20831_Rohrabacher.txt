    Mr. Rohrabacher. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I've got a wild question at the end to ask you, but in the meantime, let me do some business here.    We started off this program with a $300 million grant in 1980. Is that correct? Okay.    Mr. Rohrabacher. Okay. So--okay. I thought that you said it was 1980. In 1994, was the first major expenditure of $300 million?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Okay. So from those early experiments until now, how much are we talking about that's been spent on the project?    Mr. Rohrabacher. We talked about everybody's working together and many different countries have contributed. How much have they contributed to this effort?    Mr. Rohrabacher. The Japanese, you say?    Mr. Rohrabacher. So would it be fair to say we've spent about half the money that was necessary for the project to be successful as you are today, and the rest of the world spent half of that, and----    Mr. Rohrabacher. I've always supported basically research when we're looking out because I've been told that if we're looking out into outer space that we actually can determine what's going on in the molecular structures that can have impact, major impacts here, and sometimes it's easier to see it out there than it is to see it through your little microscopes. Telescopes and microscopes are very related from when I was first educated when I first came here, so I've tried to be supportive of both efforts.    Now let me ask a little--I know this--Mr. Chairman, just one--first of all, we're talking about waves, and I'm a surfer, of course, and I want to find out about riding waves, but will this discovery that you are talking about today make time travel any more--I mean, this is one thing I've been hearing about. Will it make it any more likely?    Mr. Rohrabacher. Well, thank you very much.
