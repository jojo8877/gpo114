    Ms. Chu. Mr. Blanco, just yesterday there was the directive issued, and it required the Federal prosecutor to justify in writing whether there should be a joint task force. But it seemed that the new directive doesn't prescribe the importance of any particular factor.    Could you describe a situation in which a Federal prosecutor may find one, but not all of the factors to be present and still find insufficient Federal law enforcement oversight or participation? For example, could you walk us through how a prosecutor would determine whether Federal forfeiture should apply in situations where Federal authorities are not involved in the investigation leading up to the seizure but were only pulled in at the time of the actual seizure?    Ms. Chu. So let me ask, the new directive places a great deal of discretion on the Federal prosecutors to determine whether the seizure by State and local law enforcement should be treated as Federal forfeiture. Will there be a review process of these decisions?    Ms. Chu. Thank you.    Ms. Sheth, there is this incredible incentive for State and local law enforcement to do these seizures, and it is troubling that someone with the authority to seize property should be incentivized to do so. Could you walk us through reforms that could balance the monetary needs of local and State law enforcement for these assets while reducing the negative incentives that the Equitable Sharing Program creates?
