    Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, what priority do you assign to the Department's nuclear deterrence mission?    Mr. Rogers. Well, that leads me to my second question. Do you see the recapitalization of the nuclear deterrent as affordable in this budget environment?    Mr. Rogers. Great.    General Dunford, are the Joint Chiefs convinced and unanimous that we must modernize the triad?    General Dunford. Congressman, I am. I have not talked to the current group of Chiefs collectively, but previously, when I was the Commandant of the Marine Corps and we met with General Dempsey, my predecessor, the Joint Chiefs unanimously subscribed to modernization of the triad.    Mr. Rogers. Great.    General, your predecessor undertook an assessment of the Russian violation of the INF Treaty. He concluded it posed a risk to the United States itself as well as to the security of our allies in Europe. Do you agree?    General Dunford. I do, Congressman. In fact, it reflected in the budget our capabilities to deal with just that threat.    Mr. Rogers. Well, we have been waiting over a year to be briefed on the military options that you have in response to that. Can you assure me we will get that for my staff, me and the ranking member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, within the next 3 or 4 weeks?    General Dunford. Congressman, I or my staff will come over and see you soonest.    Mr. Rogers. I would appreciate that.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield the balance of my time to my friend and colleague from Minnesota, Mr. Kline.
