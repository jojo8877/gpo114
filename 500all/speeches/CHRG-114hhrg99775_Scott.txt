    Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Melius, can you give us a little history about how long we have known about the dangers of silica?    Mr. Scott. Did I understand you to say that the chance of coming down with silicosis if you are exposed at the present level is about 100 percent?    Mr. Scott. Can you describe the health problems that result?    Mr. Scott. What kind of health cost savings can be generated if you reduce exposure?    Mr. Scott. I have been advised that OSHA estimates an annual net benefit over the next 60 years of $3.8- to $7.7 billion, after an annual cost of the rule of about $1 billion, a net benefit of 3.8 to 7.7. What kind of underlying numbers would they be looking at?    Mr. Scott. Some businesses have to pay this in terms of higher health care costs, health care premiums, and Workers' Compensation, is that right?    Mr. Scott. Now, someone talked about the costs. Could you tell me if you are aware if the National Asphalt Paving Association has taken a position on the rule?    Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
