    Mr. Pitts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me continue with you, Mr. Wilson. You have a compelling story. I really appreciate hearing it. And you went in the Navy, and that was the key. What were your skills before you went in and how was the Navy effective in changing your skill level?    Mr. Pitts. What were the key components? You have a real compelling story. I want to drill down a little bit. What are the key components to your behavioral change?    Mr. Pitts. Now, in talking about working with people who need a second chance, how do you teach and how do they emphasize the right character qualities for behavioral change to get them so they do show up on time, you know, that they are the type of employee that employers want to hire. Would you develop that a little bit?    Mr. Pitts. And you are obviously teaching that to your children so you can replicate success.    Mr. Pitts. You are a real inspiration. Thank you very much. My time----    Mr. Pitts . Has expired.
