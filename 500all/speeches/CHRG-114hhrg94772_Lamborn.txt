    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for having this hearing. Thank you for your flexibility. It is my honor to introduce one of our witnesses, Mr. John Swartout, who is the Senior Policy Advisor, as you said, for Governor John Hickenlooper.    In the past, Mr. Swartout has been Executive Director of Greater Outdoors Colorado, GOCO, and of the Colorado Coalition of Land Trust; so he does have a lot of resource and land background and experience. In addition to working for Governor Hickenlooper, he has worked in the past for Senator Wayne Allard and Governor Bill Owens. He is one of these individuals whose abilities are sought out by governors and administrations on both sides of the aisle, and I think that is a real testament to his ability. I am glad we can have him here today; and I really commend his testimony to everyone who is at this hearing, and listening, and will read later, like I will, because I can't stay for the whole hearing.    So thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.    The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Lamborn.    Mr. Polis, I understand Mr. Arnett is your constituent.
