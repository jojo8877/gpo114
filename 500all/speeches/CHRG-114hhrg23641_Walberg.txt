    Mr.  Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thanks to the panel for being here.    Mr. Judd, a constituent of mine who is a DHS officer contacted me. He has been working on the border in California. He expressed concerns about a policy, as he puts it, with California and Mexico where individuals who cross the border illegally cannot be sent home but are processed through, and then released into the U.S. with court dates as long as 7 to 10 years down the road. Are you aware of that policy?    Mr.  Walberg. Is it unique to California?    Mr.  Walberg. Are all the aliens who cross the border given notices to appear before the court?    Mr.  Walberg. What is the typical time frame for court hearings?    Mr.  Walberg. Mr. Vitiello? Did I get that right?    Mr.  Walberg. So your contention is it is funding?    Mr.  Walberg. Let me ask Mr. Judd, are there any efforts to keep track of the whereabouts of the individuals that are awaiting these lengthy time frame court hearings?    Mr.  Walberg. Large buildings.    Mr.  Walberg. I assume this is frustrating to your colleagues?    Mr.  Walberg. Mr. McCraw, how are the administration's efforts or enforcement priorities and release policies affecting your organization?    Mr.  Walberg. I would assume you have ideas on how to secure that, and even policies that could be implemented rather rapidly. If you were allowed, as a State official responsible for securing your people's safety and borders, could you do it?    Mr.  Walberg. So this isn't a problem but for the fact you are not allowed to do what you are able to do, and I would assume, Mr. Vitiello, as well.    Mr.  Walberg. Thank you.
