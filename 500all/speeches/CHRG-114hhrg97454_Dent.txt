    Mr. Dent . Good morning.    I would like to bring to order this hearing for Veterans Affairs--for the MILCON V.A. Subcommittee. Thank you all for attending.    And today, I am very pleased to welcome Secretary Robert A. McDonald, Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, for his first appearance before this subcommittee, defending his fiscal year 2016 budget request.    Mr. Secretary, we know you have a lot of important material you want to present to us today, and subcommittee members have a lot of questions for you and I know competing hearings as well. So we would appreciate you being willing to keep your opening remarks to within 10 minutes.    I will also keep my opening remarks to a minimum.    Secretary Bob, you come before us at a challenging time for the V.A. You are trying to recover from the wait list scandal and implement the complex new Choice legislation.    And you are trying to bring about a transformation of the agency to make it more veteran-service-centric and certainly more customer-friendly, and we appreciate those very good and sincere efforts.    You are also defending an enormous budget increase in your discretionary budget of about $5.1 billion, or a 7.8 percent increase, which is financed by offsets in the President's budget that Congress, frankly, is unlikely to accept.    I have to be frank with you, Mr. Secretary. Any increases are going to be extremely difficult to fund under the constraints we have, and all departments are going to be affected under the BCA, the Budget Control Act, with a government-wide increase in the non-defense discretionary cap of $1.1 billion. We can't make room for a $5.1 billion increase without taking a machete to important programs in other subcommittees. I suspect the chairman may agree with me on that point.    We fully appreciate the complex mission you have at the V.A. and share your dedication to making it work better. You have a lot of great employees out there, and when I visit facilities, I am always extraordinarily impressed by your medical team and all the allied health professionals.    The subcommittee welcomes the opportunity to learn about your vision for addressing the V.A.'s problems and reforming the agency so that we are sure we are giving veterans who want to use the V.A. the services they deserve.    Mr. Bishop is not here at the moment.    I am going to quickly yield to the chairman and then to the ranking member of the full committee for their opening statements.               Full Committee Chairman Opening Statement    Mr. Dent. Thank you.    Mr. Dent. Third hearing.    Mr. Dent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to second your statement, particularly the issue of the interoperability between the V.A. and the DOD health record. It is very important. It is a priority, I think, for all of us.    At this time, I would like to recognize distinguished ranking member, Mrs. Lowey.            Full Committee Ranking Member Opening Statement    Mr. Dent. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey, for your comments.    At this time, Mr. Secretary, your full statement will be included in the official record. After you introduce those who are accompanying you today, please feel free to begin.    And members are reminded that we will be operating on a 5-minute rule for questions. So, with that, Secretary Bob.                     Secretary's Opening Statement    Mr. Dent. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Mr. Secretary, I have to begin with an issue I view as critical to the future of the V.A., and we have discussed this. And I know this view is shared with members of the subcommittee.    The Choice Act, as you know, is bifurcated, reflecting the different views of the members of the House and Senate authorizing committees at the time. On the one hand, the Choice Act sets up a system for non-V.A. care to be provided in situations where distance or wait time prevent access to direct V.A. health care.    But it also finances a hiring of almost 10,000 new V.A. medical staff, and more than 200 facility leases and construction projects in an effort to strengthen capacity for direct V.A. care. This is a rhetorical question, but is this bifurcated system sustainable in the long term? Can we afford to build up the V.A. system with its aging infrastructure, at the same time as we develop non-V.A. care alternatives?    I personally think that non-V.A. care is a great and underutilized alternative, particularly in the aftermath of what happened in Phoenix and elsewhere around the country. Many veterans have high-quality, non-V.A. facilities in their neighborhoods, but aren't able to use them, and instead have to travel great distances for V.A. care.    Let me be clear, I understand and support the need for the V.A. to provide specialty services in areas like polytrauma injury, PTSD, TBI, Agent Orange, behavioral health, and other areas. But why shouldn't we rely on high-quality, private-sector providers for more routine, non-service-related care?    That is really my question. And for you, Mr. Secretary, given where I live and many members live, we have some world-class facilities that just really cannot be utilized by many of our nation's veterans who deserve the best.    Mr. Dent. In my observation, is many veterans are aware of the program, but for whatever reasons, they are not eligible; either they don't meet the 40-mile requirement, or a scheduling issue. But as a quick follow up, would the idea of a mix, or integration of the V.A. in private sector, could that help us to address the facility challenges that you so clearly articulated in your testimony? Would this help us predict where veterans will be geographically in order to build the facilities years in advance?    Mr. Dent. And I would also mention, too, last week a group, Concerned Veterans for America, released a report called ``Fixing Veterans Health Care.'' The report prescribes a major restructuring of the V.A. health care.    Among its proposals, this bipartisan task force recommends that future veterans be required to enter a new V.A. insurance system with varying levels of coverage. Currently-enrolled veterans would be able to continue using V.A. health facilities, or shift to subsidized care to private providers.    It also calls for the closure of inefficient V.A. medical facilities similar to your testimony. Mr. Secretary, I know you issued a statement rejecting the report saying that, ``Although there is an important role for non-V.A. care in supplementing V.A. health care, reform cannot be achieved by dismantling the V.A. system or preventing veterans from receiving V.A. care.''    I am certainly not endorsing the report in its entirety, but I do think it could jumpstart a healthy debate about how to more efficiently and cost-effectively provide care to veterans. I would be curious about your thoughts.    Mr. Dent. Thank you. My time is expired. I would like to recognize the very distinguished ranking member.seeing cemeteries, as you have. A week from Friday, I am dedicating the California Central Coast Veterans Cemetery in my district. Your department has been very helpful in its creation and I wanted to thank those in your department who worked in that.    You indicated in one of the Chairman's questions about some sort of combined professional network involving the public and private sector that could help provide more mental health practitioners. I am very concerned that because of PTSD TBI, and other mental health issues, our veterans in California are suffering unnecessarily due to a shortage of appropriate doctors. I know that Congresswoman Barbara Lee is very concerned about this, too. We can't find marriage and family therapists to work for the V.A. because the V.A. has an accreditation issue in California. I really want you to go back and find out what initiated the ruling on this issue. We can't hire marriage and family therapists in the V.A. unless they have graduated from institutions that have specific accreditation curriculum.    California has 95 percent of certified marriage and family therapists who cannot qualify to work for the V.A. They went to Stanford, they went to Berkeley. I mean, this is nuts. I can't believe that they can't take steps to correct that.    We are opening the first jointly designed DOD/V.A. clinic on the Monterey peninsula, next year and we are having a heck of a problem trying to hire a psychiatrist to come there. You are having even a harder time getting marriage and family therapists. A lot of them in the community would love to go work for the V.A. I hope that you will check what steps the V.A. is taking in providing and maintaining a significant number of mental health practitioners.    When can you accept the credentialing of California marriage and family therapists as part of that professional core that you want to increase?    Let me also ask you to look into the backlog with the board of appeals. Mr. Secretary, the amount of money you are committing to that is going to be cut, in these reductions the chair is talking about. He is not the only chair--every chair of every appropriations committee is giving the warning, Mr. Secretary. What we do here is, we have all these nice hearings on what the President has proposed. Then we get the numbers from the Budget Committee. And then we go behind closed doors, and cut the hell out of everything. Then we adopt it without any public transparency. I hope this year will change that, and that we have subsequent hearings once we get the numbers, saying ``this is what you are asking'', ``this is what you are going to get.''    What are the consequences? Because that is what we are supposed to relay to our constituents. So, if you could look into the marriage and family counseling and the backlog on the board of appeals, I would appreciate it.    Lastly, let me just ask, if local law enforcement officers are coming to me and they say that the V.A. needs to assist local law enforcement officers and VSOs in dealing with suicidal veterans who should they contact to help these people that they know from the local community are in harms' way? There is no kind of crisis core in the V.A. who can go out with law enforcement and intervene in these crises with veterans, who have real problems. I would like to see if we could develop that enterprise. Thank you.    Mr. Dent. Would you like to respond quickly, Mr. Secretary?    Mr. Dent. Thank you. At this time, I would like to recognize Mr. Jolly, of Florida.    Mr. Dent. Thank you, Mr. Jolly. That reminds me of the old George Bernard Shaw statement that ``the rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.'' Something we certainly don't want to have happen. Mr. Bishop.    Mr. Dent. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. And I am sure there will be more questions on that particular topic. Mr. Rooney.    Mr. Dent. Thank you. I just want to point out for the record, I made that particular quote about the rumors of my death being greatly exaggerated. I attributed it to George Bernard Shaw. I believe it was Mark Twain. So with that, I recognize Mr. Price.    Mr. Dent. I would like to recognize Ms. Lee at this time.    Mr. Dent. Mr. Fortenberry.    Mr. Dent. Thank you, and you did.    At this time I would like to recognize the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Joyce.    Mr. Dent. Thank you for respecting the time on that.    That ends round one of the questioning; we will move into round two.    I want to try to conclude this hearing by lunchtime, by noon, again. So, Mr. Secretary, following up on Mr. Bishop's comments, and also Chairman Rogers about the interoperability to help work through the records.    Obviously you haven't been here for the frustrating experience of watching DOD and V.A. develop a single integrated health record then spend years and hundreds of millions of dollars on it, only to throw in the towel and go down two separate tracks.    DOD will soon award a contract for a new electronic health record. The V.A. is working to modernize its existing VistA health records. Both departments are sort of committed to making their records interoperable with the private riders that both active service members and veterans use.    I also want you to know that members of the House Appropriations Committee--we are strongly in favor of the integrated health record. And we are determined that the two records be interoperable. Just want to--again, hear your assurances that this is going to happen.    And, moreover, I want to talk a little bit about the money side of this. Congress provided $344 million for the V.A., electronic health record for fiscal year 2015. And despite all the increases elsewhere in the budget, you are requesting $111 million less than for 2016.    You indicate that less funding is required because the transition from moving from a single to two interoperable records took longer than anticipated leaving carryover 2015 funds. And that less 2016 funding better aligns with program requirements and workload capacity. The Committee certainly does not want to provide you with funding that you cannot use, but what does that say about your progress in modernizing VistA?    Will you still meet your deadline of reaching final operating capacity for VistA evolution by 2018?    Mr. Dent. Thank you.    Mr. Secretary, the recent Academy Award given to the documentary profiling the V.A. crisis hotline brought a fresh public spotlight on the tragic problem of suicide and mental illness and behavioral health among veterans that the V.A. has been battling for many years. In response to the problem over the years, the V.A. has increased its number of mental health practitioners, incorporated mental health services into primary care to reduce stigma, conducted research on effective treatments for service-related mental health issues and supported numerous outreach and prevention campaigns.    Can you tell us what additional steps the V.A. plans to take to battle suicide and serious mental illness within the veteran population? I know that you plan to hire more than 2,100 mental health staff through the Choice Act funding by the end of 2016, as an example.    Mr. Dent. Very, very quickly--just quickly back to the Choice Act, Mr. Secretary, you are no doubt aware of the initial report on the Choice program the VFW organization released yesterday.    The group surveyed their membership to judge how many qualified and were able to use Choice, although the VFW report acknowledges that the V.A. didn't have much time to get the program running, that the V.A. has been working hard to improve it. The results of that they reported were disappointing.    VFW says that only 20 percent of veterans who live more than 40 miles from the nearest facility or who had to wait more than 30 days for an appointment were offered the Choice option.    Almost all those surveyed who were not offered Choice said they were interested in obtaining non-V.A. care.    Don't the VFW findings contradict your statements that not many veterans seem to be interested in using Choice to obtain non-V.A. care? My sense is many are very interested, just simply not eligible.    Mr. Dent. Thank you.    At this time, I yield to Mr. Bishop.    Mr. Dent. I recognize Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Dent. Can we submit for the record what your authorities are? That would be very helpful.    I recognize Mr. Fortenberry.    Mr. Dent. Thank you. That concludes the second round.    But before we depart, I want to ask one quick question and then will submit the balance of my questions for the record.    Mr. Secretary, your predecessor set goals of ending the disabilities claims backlog of defining backlog as taking longer than 125 days per claim. And achieving a 98 percent accuracy in completing claims by 2015.    Your budget document states that you will meet the timeliness standard--outside observers are a little more skeptical. It appears that trend in backlog reduction has declined in the last 8 months.    Your budget documents are silent about whether you will be able to meet the 98 percent accuracy goal by the end of the year. Why has that goal proved more elusive to you and what steps, like training, are necessary for you to achieve your quality goal?                                          Thursday, March 19, 2015.    Mr. Dent . We will bring this meeting to order. Good morning.    We would like to welcome Mr. Richard Griffin, the deputy inspector general for the Veterans Administration, to discuss his office's oversight efforts at the Veterans Administration.    This is probably one of the most active periods in recent memory for your office, Mr. Griffin, with your audits of whistleblower allegations and the wait list scandal reports that you are required to make to Congress by the Choice Act. You have also had to respond to recent charges that your office has fallen a little bit short on transparency by failing to release some investigative reports.    Members of the subcommittee will no doubt have many questions about the many areas of your oversight, and we understand that you have a previous engagement that requires you to leave at 11:30 this morning, and we will do our best to honor that. But with all the issues, from the wait list scandal to the construction challenges issue at Denver and so many other issues, I look forward to just getting right into this testimony.    At this time I would like to ask our ranking member, Mr. Bishop, if he has any opening remarks that he would like to make?                Ranking Member Bishop Opening Statement    Mr. Dent. Thank you.    So, Mr. Griffin, your full statement will be entered into the record. Please introduce Mr. Daigh, who is with you at the witness table, and please summarize your testimony for us. And I know we are going to be interrupted by votes at some point, so we are going to try to move along as quickly as we can.    Mr. Dent. Thank you, Mr. Griffin.    And I will get to the Tomah issue in a moment, but I just wanted to first start with the waiting list scandal.    Your office was obviously thrust into the epicenter of the wait list scandal last year. Your testimony indicates that you have undertaken 98 audits responding to allegations of scheduling manipulation and that so far you have referred 44 audits to the department's Office of Accountability Review for administrative action. You are still working at the other 54 sites.    Should we conclude from the 44 completed audits that scheduling manipulation was endemic to all the hospitals you visited? And are the violations you identified matters of breaking the law or administrative malfeasance, and has the Department of Justice been willing to take any of these cases you have identified?    Mr. Dent. There are conflicting media reports in the wake of President Obama's visit to the Phoenix hospital. One of the whistleblowers said that progress was being made and that terrific strides had been made in on-time appointments; another one of the whistleblowers dismissed any notion of progress and said that the V.A. was still gaming the system of appointment delays.    What conclusions have you made about the pace of the progress from your most recent audits?    Mr. Dent. And I would like to also just follow up on the last comment on Phoenix. After the Phoenix wait list scandal the V.A. took steps to reorganize and strengthen the Veterans Health Administration's Office of Medical Inspector, OMI, including creating an audit capacity for that office.    What does the OMI do that is different from the OIG? Do the two groups often have the same cases?    Mr. Dent. So it is not redundant?    Mr. Dent. Thank you, and I would like to yield this time to our distinguished ranking member, Mr. Bishop?    Mr. Dent. Thank you, Ms. Lee, and thank you for your service on the Budget Committee. I know you are a little busy today. Hope you got a little sleep.    At this time I would like to recognize Mr. Jolly for 5 minutes?    Mr. Dent. Thank you.    I would like to, at this time recognize the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Bishop?    Mr. Dent. Thanks.    Before I recognize Mr. Rooney I just want to say we are in votes. I think there are about 9 minutes left in the vote.    We will have Mr. Rooney proceed and then when he is finished we will recess briefly. It is only two votes, so we will vote on the two then come right back.    So with that, I would like to recognize Mr. Rooney, for 5 minutes?    Mr. Dent. Mrs. Roby, I was going to suggest maybe we go vote now, unless you want--do you have quick questions? Maybe we can do them quickly, or we can vote and come back.    Let's go ahead. I recognize you for 5 minutes. Then we can run downstairs----    Mr. Dent. No. They were important questions.    With zero on the clock 217 members have not yet voted, so what we will do is we will recess this meeting to the call of the chair, but I suspect we will just be back within 10 minutes, and respectful of your time, as well.    So thank you. This meeting is in recess to the call of the chair.    Mr. Dent. We would like to bring to order this recessed meeting of the Subcommittee on Military Construction and V.A. We are going to move into our second round of questions right now.    And I know we have to be respectful of your time, Mr. Griffin, but I just wanted to start off with Tomah, once again, and one question I asked didn't get a chance to answer. Is there no standard policy for a government--for government-wide--a standard wide policy for I.G.s to follow about the circumstances in which I.G.s must release the reports from their investigations and audits?    Mr. Dent. Got it.    I would like to now move on to the ongoing I.G. review at the Philadelphia Regional Office. We understand that your office has been doing a review during the past 6 months at the Philadelphia Regional Office and that so many allegations have been raised by office employees that you won't be able to investigate each allegation individually. Press reports indicate that the concerns being raised include mismanagement, retaliation, wasted government resources, and lack of accountability for certain managers.    I realize the report is not yet completed, but can you give us a sense of the scope of the problems in Philly, and how does that office rank relative to other regional offices? Are these problems that you see throughout the country? Is Philadelphia responding to the allegations with staff changes and procedural fixes?    Mr. Dent. Thank you.    I would like to quickly move over to the contract review of the Denver hospital. The inspector general has an Office of Contract Review. Does this office have a regular role in reviewing V.A. construction documents, and has that office been involved in the controversy about the contract for the Denver V.A. Hospital?    Has your office done programmatic reviews of the Denver construction project during its long history? And if so, what systematic problems has the Denver experience revealed about the V.A. construction process?    And just a point of clarification for the members, I think you should all be aware by now, but the total cost, according to Sloan Gibson, over the Denver V.A. Hospital is at $1.73 billion, and that is leaving an unfunded amount of about $830 million, which is just eye-popping, and I know the authorizers are extremely upset about this.    But it is a very serious matter and we are watching this issue very, very closely, as--from the appropriations side because of this colossal problem that, you know, has been dumped on our lap and we are being asked to resolve.    Mr. Dent. Well, thank you. We want you to stay on top of that because this project at $1.73 billion is more than five times the facility's original estimate of $328 million. I have never seen a construction disaster of this proportion.    I know the ranking member has concerns as well. And so with that, I would like to recognize the ranking member for 5 minutes.    Mr. Dent. I thank the ranking member.    At this time I would like to recognize Mr. Joyce for 5 minutes.    Mr. Dent. Thank you.    Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Dent. I appreciate the member's comments, and we are going to do our best on that front.    Now I recognize Mr. Fortenberry for 5 minutes.    Mr. Dent. Thank you. And if there are other, further questions from any of the members----    Mr. Dent. And before you do, I was going to ask just one question----    Mr. Dent. If it is okay with the ranking member, I would just ask--recognize Mr. Joyce briefly afterwards.    So with that, I just wanted to ask my other question, Mr. Griffin, on Legionnaires' disease in V.A. facilities. Your office was very active in exposing the Legionnaires' disease patient care problems in some Pennsylvania facilities. In response, the V.A. is using a total of $167 million in the 2015 and 2016 Choice Act funding to make infrastructure changes to prevent the recurrence of the Legionnaires' situation.    Do you think the V.A. plans are sufficient to address this problem?    Mr. Dent. Thank you.    Does the ranking member have any additional questions?    Okay. Then we will recognize Mr. Joyce, and then that will end the hearing.    Mr. Dent. Well, thank you. This concludes our hearing.    I have several more questions I am going to submit for the record, and hopefully you can get back to us on those two questions, which I think you already partially addressed.    So with that, I want to thank everybody for your attendance today.    Appreciate your presence today, Mr. Griffin and Dr. Daigh. At this time, this meeting of the subcommittee is adjourned.
