    Mr. Hudson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the panel for this very informative discussion.    It was mentioned that there are clusters of dengue in Florida and Texas. It got me thinking, just in terms of folks coming across our southern border. There's been a lot of discussion about different diseases and other public health concerns.    Dr. Frieden, is this also a concern that folks coming across the border could be bringing Zika with them? Is that something we're looking at?    Mr. Hudson. I understand. Dr. Lurie, what role will mosquito or vector control play in our response to Zika?    Mr. Hudson. Well, there are currently 700 mosquito control districts across the United States at the state and local level. What role should the federal government play in mosquito control?    Mr. Hudson. When you talk about houses to target are you talking about spraying insecticide?    Mr. Hudson. Is that the effective way to----    Mr. Hudson. OK. Well, because the mosquito that carries Zika breeds in small pools of water often indoors near houses, aggressive trash cleanup and removal is something that's been talked about as one of the most effective ways. Do you envision a federal role in terms of trash cleanup and those sort of things, or is it more information----    Mr. Hudson. So the funding request doesn't cover any of those type activities. It's more just the coordination and information?    Mr. Hudson. Makes sense. Is it possible to predict or anticipate using surveillance or other means what the next emerging infectious disease would be?    Mr. Hudson. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I'm out of time. I yield back.
