    Mr. Lieu. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Mr. Lieu. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you to the panel for your excellent report. I think many of us agree with you that you need better leadership. But it is awfully hard to lead without the appropriate resources. And I wanted to sort of give you the opportunity to respond to what a member very early in the panel had Stated about--because other law enforcement agencies like the FBI had an increase in funding, therefore, the Secret Service must also have had adequate funding. But, in fact, that's not true, right? Hasn't the budgets remained largely flat while your missions have actually increased in complexity?    Mr. Lieu. I have a question for you, the immediately prior member asked a question and sort of stated that folks last year requested a smaller budget. Was that because they were ordered to do so because of sequestration? They just had to come up with numbers to meet a certain threshold?    Mr. Lieu. Thank you. Representative Lawrence had read from Bennie Thompson's letter to us. I am going to read another part of the letter. He says ``years of making budget requests, combined with the reduction of appropriations have left the agency struggling to meet its multi-faceted mission and failing to meet our expectations.'' I assume you agree with that?    Mr. Lieu. So, Mr. Chairman, with unanimous consent, I ask that Ranking Member Thompson's full Statement be entered into the official hearing record.    Mr. Lieu. So I am very pleased that you are here, that you issued the report. And I hope we can begin the process of restoring both the Secret Service, as well as protection for our homeland. And we can do that by, first of all, passing a clean DHS bill, so I yield back.    Mr. Lieu. I will yield.
