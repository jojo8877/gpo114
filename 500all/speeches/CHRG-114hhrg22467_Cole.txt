    Mr. Cole. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you very much for the hearing. This is very fascinating stuff, and I want to thank our witnesses for their presentation. Dr. Smith, as a fellow Oklahoman, I am very impressed and very pleased with your business model. If I am correct, you do not take any Federal payment for any of the services. Is that correct?    Mr. Cole. Can you quickly tell us what were the reasons that you came to that decision that it was really better from your standpoint not to be involved directly involved in something like Medicare?    Mr. Cole. Do you think that the model that you have would be transferable to something like primary care or other branches of medicine as opposed to just elective surgery?    Mr. Cole. That is amazing. Do you find that the model that you have is being replicated other places? Do you get a lot of contact from other physicians or physician-owned facilities about what you do, and are you seeing this spread at all?    Mr. Cole. Well, I would love to contact you some time and just come by and see your facility.    Mr. Cole. Very impressed. In the limited time I have left, Dr. Lindsay, if I could move to you. I actually chair the subcommittee where we do Pell Grants, so your testimony was wonderful to me, and let me ask you this. One of the things we see is a problem sometimes is that a lot of States really have pulled back in the degree to which they support students, and a lot of that cost has shifted to the Federal Government. Does your experience suggest that is the case?    Mr. Cole. Well, if I could ask my questions, I am about out of time here so I would prefer to choose the witnesses I would like to question. Thank you very much. I am out of time so I will yield back, but thank you, Mr. Chairman.
