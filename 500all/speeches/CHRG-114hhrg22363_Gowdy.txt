    Mr. Gowdy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I want to read a regulation. I would ask all the panelists to pay attention. It's a little tedious, but it's important: If new or unanticipated threats or hazards are discovered by either the government or the contractor, or if existing safeguards have ceased to function, the discoverer shall immediately bring the situation to the attention of the other party.    That's a regulation. Mr. Hess, Mr. Giannetta, were there also contractual obligations in this realm between you and the government?    Mr. Gowdy. And they would be what, similar to that, notice? A notice provision?    Mr. Gowdy. Okay. I think it's helpful sometimes to define terms, particularly for those of us that are liberal arts majors and don't deal with this. What is a ``new or unanticipated threat or hazard''? Mr. Hess?    Mr. Gowdy. Oh. So when Chairman Chaffetz was having a difficult time getting answers to that question because the focus was on the loss of personal information, that's really not what that phrase means. It's just a threat or hazard. It doesn't actually have to be a loss, does it?    Mr. Gowdy. Me either.    What about ``existing safeguards have ceased to function?'' What does that mean? Mr. Hess?    Mr. Gowdy. It did strike me as being self-explanatory. It did.    Mr. Giannetta, is that self-explanatory to you, ``existing safeguards have ceased to function?''    Mr. Gowdy. Here is the really tough question, and I will let both of you weigh in on this one because it is tough. What does the word ``immediately'' mean?    Mr. Gowdy. Without delay.    Mr. Giannetta, is there another meaning that you are familiar with?    Mr. Gowdy. All right. So you had both a contractual obligation with the government and there is a regulatory obligation that if new or unanticipated threats or hazards are discovered by either the government or the contractor, or if existing safeguards have ceased to function, the discoverer shall immediately bring the situation to the attention of the other party.    Ms. Archuleta, I have heard this morning about a March 2014 data breach. Did I hear that right?    Mr. Gowdy. And when did you bring that breach to the attention of either Mr. Hess or Mr. Giannetta? And you are welcome to turn on your microphone or else bring it closer to you.    Mr. Gowdy. Do you know if it was immediately?    Mr. Gowdy. Let's find out. Ms. Seymour, do you know?    Mr. Gowdy. Mr. Hess, Mr. Giannetta, is that your understanding, that they were under no duty to bring that to your attention? Not all at once. It's your contractual language, and you are looking at the regulation. Do you think you should have been notified because of the March breach?    Mr. Gowdy. Well, why? Because I just heard one person say she didn't know and the other say it was really none of your business. So why should you have been notified? Despite the plain language of the regulation and the contractual language, why do you think it was important that you be notified?    Mr. Gowdy. Were you notified?    Mr. Gowdy. Were you notified immediately?    Mr. Gowdy. Huh. What do you have to say about that, Ms. Seymour?    Mr. Gowdy. I am with you there. I guess my question is, why? Why, despite the plain language of the contract and the plain language of the regulation, why did you not immediately notify the contractors?    Mr. Gowdy. Was DHS one of your contractors?    Mr. Gowdy. Well, I didn't think so. Which that doesn't really help me understand the regulation because it says ``contractor;'' it doesn't say ``DHS.'' So why didn't you notify the contractor?    Mr. Gowdy. What does the word ``immediately'' mean to you?    Mr. Gowdy. Did you do so?    Mr. Gowdy. Does the regulation say ``as soon as you figure out what happened'' or ``after you talk to DHS?'' That is not in my version of the regulation. Is it in yours?    Mr. Gowdy. You know why you haven't? Because that one doesn't exist. The one that says ``notify DHS'' or ``try to figure it out.'' The only one that exists says to immediately notify the contractor, and you are telling me you didn't do it. And my question is, why?    Mr. Gowdy. Who can?    Mr. Gowdy. To whom will you take it?    Mr. Gowdy. Do you think it's staff's responsibility to notify the contractor?    Mr. Gowdy. Who is ultimately responsible for that process? Who failed to meet the contractual and regulatory obligations?    Mr. Gowdy. I just read it.    Mr. Gowdy. You think the context is different from what I just read?    Mr. Gowdy. How about the contract? Have you read the contract?    Mr. Gowdy. Well, I can't speak for the chairman, but my guess is that he and the other members would be really interested in who failed to honor both the letter and the spirit of the contractual obligation and the regulatory obligation.    With that, I will yield back.
