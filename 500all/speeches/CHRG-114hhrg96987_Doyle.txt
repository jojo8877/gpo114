    Mr. Doyle . Testimony you mentioned that for the proposed governance structure of IANA to work that ICANN must ensure it is accountable to the broader community of stakeholders. Have you seen ICANN take steps to empower the broader community in such a way as to enable this greater accountability, or what concerns still remain?    Mr. Doyle. Yes, and you mentioned one source of accountability is for the community to be able to award the IANA contract to another entity down the road. Do you see this as an effective check towards improving ICANN's governance and accountability?    Mr. Doyle. Yes. Ms. Kehl, in your testimony you said that, had NTIA not voluntarily undertaken this transition, that other stakeholders would have moved forward. Tell us how U.S. leadership in this transition driven--how U.S. leadership has driven stakeholders to the table, and what will be the consequences if we have delays?    Mr. Doyle. Would either of you like to add anything to that, Ms. Plonk or Mr. Shears? OK. Mr. Chairman, I will just close by saying that I want to keep it in Los Angeles, California, but not Houston, Texas. Thank you.
