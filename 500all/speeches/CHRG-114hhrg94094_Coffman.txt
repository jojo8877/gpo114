    Mr. Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    It is my understanding that the new retirement system is all defined contribution. Am I correct in that? The proposal?    Mr. Coffman. Was there a consideration for a bifurcated system that would be part defined benefit with a vesting period and then maybe going later on and then the other part of defined contribution?    Mr. Coffman. Okay.    Mr. Coffman. Can you briefly explain that again?    Mr. Coffman. Then when is the vesting for the defined benefit part?    Mr. Coffman. Okay. And then when do they draw this? So right now under the current system you serve 20 years. And the day that you leave you start drawing.    And it is a factor--so if somebody serves 20 years they get 50 percent of their base pay the day after they leave the military. What is it again under your system, proposed system?    Mr. Coffman. Was there any discussion about a bifurcated system whereby one could serve less than 20 years, vest into the defined benefit component, and then maybe not draw until as a reservist.    With Reserve retirement, I draw at age 60; maybe then not draw until later on that defined benefit portion? Was there a consideration for that?    Mr. Coffman. Sure.    Mr. Coffman. No, you did.    Now on the TSP part----    Mr. Coffman . Defined contribution component----    Mr. Coffman. Is that a mandatory--so if I opt into this system----    Mr. Coffman . Which then is an 80-20 split to the old system----    Mr. Coffman. So now it is 80 percent of----    Mr. Coffman . 20 percent--right. Then is that a mandatory--if, in other words, if somebody opts in, is that a mandatory participation in the TSP? Or can they simply--well, I see that--I don't know why somebody would do it if it wasn't I suppose.    Mr. Coffman. It would be----    Mr. Coffman. Yes.    Mr. Coffman. And from the--okay. What is it, is it a 3 percent match as well?    Mr. Coffman. So it is all based on the individual service member initially for the first 3 years.    Mr. Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And they would choose certain investment----    Mr. Coffman. Okay.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
