    Mr. Clawson. I appreciate y'all coming. I am just going to make one comment, and then I will yield to Congressman Hurd, if that's okay.    First of all, when I looked at the participating countries, I don't see a lot of Asian competitors there. And I know what I would think if I was in private business, y'all. So you were not talking about the obvious. But I had a lot of competition coming from my--from Asia and India, and we can't be playing a different game than them, or we will lose.    So I understand the need to protect the homeland, but there's something obviously wrong with this list if you're going to--if you were trying to influence me to join up, and I saw that list, after my technology had already been stolen a half dozen times, it would be a tough, tough, sell.    Number two, with my facilities around the world, which we have, which I had, customers--you know, customers and facilities all on these lists, the foreign corrupt practice laws and everything, I don't even know how to do this. I wouldn't know how to implement it. It just feels, like, it hits me like a freight train here.    And so--and, look, I spent a lot of time doing this. So, you know, there's got to be--you would have to put it in terms. I spent, you know, yesterday and today trying to think about these things and think to myself and my own business model, how would I do this? And I never really got there. How can I compete, take care of my customers, take care of my competitors, and my suppliers across all these different borders, and not break the law and keep my country safe? So if y'all are going to do that to sitting CEOs, I recommend that you simplify it so we can understand how we get to do all those things at the same time, because I spent a whole life doing it, and I ain't getting there just yet.    I yield back to Mr. Hurd.
