    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Congratulations to you, Admiral. You are very encouraging, and it seems that you have taken this assignment on with all high expectations, and with respect to those that get the job done, on behalf of all of us. So thank you.    I just have a couple of little questions. No. 1 has to do with the Federal Air Marshal Service. My understanding is that there hasn't been a class, a recruitment, for nearly 4 years. So I am wondering, do you have any plan to address the attrition that this might represent? Are they still as necessary? Or is there something that is replacing the need for them?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you. Another area that struck me, as I was preparing for today, has to do with the Secure Identification Display Area cards, the credentials. I understand that on occasion, individuals who have had access to those cards have done things which were illegal, and which just were not acceptable.    So I was wondering, what is the--what are your plans with regard to greater accountability of those cards?    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Admiral. You have a big task ahead of you. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope that we can be helpful to you in what you need on our behalf. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
