    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Gentlemen, thank you for being here. Appreciate you for being here very much.    Full disclosure: I am from Georgia, and in Georgia we are only one of four States that has a voter ID law. In further full disclosure, I am proud of the fact that I was a member of the Georgia State legislature when we passed that bill, and I voted in favor of it and even co-sponsored it. So full disclosure there.    I want to ask each of you, if you will, do you think it is one of our greatest rights here in America, the right to vote? Do you value that, as I do, as one of your greatest rights as a citizen?    Mr. Carter. Thank you.    Mr. Carter. Thank you all.    Let me ask you. At least three of the four of you are secretaries of State. Do you consider it your responsibility in the office that you hold to make certain that only American citizens vote in our elections?    Mr. Carter. Thank you.    Mr. Carter. Thank you. Thank you.    Mr. Dunlap?    Mr. Carter. Mr. Husted, you have made it clear that Ohio takes this very seriously and you have a number of checks and balances to make sure that it is a truly American citizen who gets to vote.    Mr. Kobach, I am very aware you have the same laws as the State of Georgia with voter ID.    Mr. Dunlap, I am just a little bit concerned. I still don't understand the checks and balances that exist in Maine to make sure, the system there, that only Americans are voting.    Mr. Carter. OK, so you don't have voter ID, but what proof do you require, then?    Mr. Carter. I understand. Is a Social Security card enough?    Mr. Carter. So it takes more than that.    Mr. Carter. Much has been made here today about the fact of this .002 percent, and I get that, I understand that. But I think all of you agree that even that should be zero, not .002 percent.    Mr. Dunlap, one last question. How many elections in the past few years have been decided in the State of Maine by .002 percent or less?    Mr. Carter. So that .002 percent could have made a difference.    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
