    Mr. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Today's hearing is entitled ``Are We Losing the Space Race to China?'' and if I were to try to summarize your collective testimony, as I understand it, you're saying that the United States is not losing the race to China but China is gaining ground.    Mr. Shea, would that be a fair summary of your remarks?    Mr. Brooks. Mr. Stokes, did I accurately summarize your viewpoint?    Mr. Brooks. Mr. Cheng, did I accurately summarize your view on this issue?    Mr. Brooks. And Dr. Lewis, did I accurately summarize your view on this issue?    Mr. Brooks. I come from a district in the northern part of Alabama, home of the Marshall Space Flight Center, and some would say it's the birthplace of America's manned spaceflight program. I still have about 6,000 people who are employed either by NASA at the Marshall Space Flight Center or as support contractors for NASA, so in my district, people are pretty well educated about NASA and space, and why it is or is not important. But that having been said, in practical day-to-day terms, why should Americans care about whether the Chinese are catching the United States of America in the space race, or perhaps even one day surpassing us, and whoever would like to handle that question, please feel free to interject. Mr. Cheng.    Mr. Brooks. Interesting concept. You're talking then in terms of geopolitical politics and perceptions of the different nations.    Mr. Shea or Mr. Stokes or Dr. Lewis, why should the American people care that China may be gaining on us, or perhaps one day surpassing us?    Mr. Brooks. Mr. Stokes or Mr. Shea, why should the average citizen, say, in Lexington, Massachusetts, care about whether the Chinese?    Mr. Brooks. Mr. Stokes, do you have anything to add?    Mr. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I see my time is expired.
