    Mr. Loudermilk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Dr. Gehin, I want to circle back over to the light water reactors. I'll take a little different approach here, but in Georgia, Plant Vogtle is bringing online hopefully very soon two Westinghouse AP-1000 reactors. We're actually taking a CODEL trip to visit Georgia Power here next month to view those.    In light of what Mr. Rohrabacher said, can you elaborate a little bit how CASL and VERA have been useful in licensing, ensuring the safety operations of the AP-1000s and should the people in Georgia be concerned or is the technology sound? Can you elaborate a little bit on these two new reactors coming online?    Mr. Loudermilk. With reactors such as the AP-1000, we're bringing these on, they're the first new reactors we've brought on in how many years?    Mr. Loudermilk. Are there obstacles that are in the way of expanding nuclear power in the nation that this body can work on?    Mr. Loudermilk. And one last question back on something that Mr. Rohrabacher brought up is other plants that had safety concerns. Can you elaborate on what were those, why were those plants shut down, and why is Plant Vogtle different?    Mr. Loudermilk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
