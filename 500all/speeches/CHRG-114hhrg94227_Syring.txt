    Admiral Syring. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Cooper, and distinguished members of this subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify in front of you today.    Our budget request for fiscal year 2016 maintains the commitment to operate and sustain homeland defenses, including us remaining on track for 44 GBIs by 2017. We also request support for test requirements and continuing to enhance the Stockpile Reliability Program component agent testing to better maintain and understand the health of the deployed system.    Testing plan for 2016 includes a non-intercept flight test to evaluate the alternate divert thrusters and support algorithm development for the important discrimination improvements for homeland defense.    As was mentioned, we continue the development of the redesigned kill vehicle for improved reliability, availability, performance, and produceability. The first flight test of this will be in 2018. The first intercept test will be in 2019. If that goes according to plan, the initial deployment will begin in 2020.    We started acquisition planning and pre-construction activity for the long-range discrimination radar. We anticipate contract award for that by the end of this fiscal year.    Our 2016 budget request supports the deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IBs and, beginning in 2018, the SM3-IIAs on ships and Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland.    We plan to procure 209 SM3-IBs by the end of 2016 and then will request multiyear procurement authorization. We also plan to deliver 48 additional THAAD interceptors to the Army for 155 total delivered by 2016.    And, finally, our advanced technology and development efforts that really ramp up this year will continue our discrimination sensor weapons technology, common kill vehicle, which includes early concept exploration of multi-object kill vehicles and technology maturation initiatives.    These investments will enable us to deploy a future BMDS architecture more capable of discriminating and killing reentry vehicles with high degree of confidence. Our low-power directed energy resources research is focused on providing the forward-tracking capability.    Mr. Chairman, MDA will continue to aggressively pursue cost reduction measures through competition, partnering, and cooperation as we deliver the best missile defense capabilities to protect our Nation, our deployed forces, and friends and allies at the lowest possible cost to the American taxpayer.    Thank you. And I look forward to the questions.    Admiral Syring. Sir, if I can, let me start back in the first round of sequestration back in 2013, when those cuts came down midyear when we were under a continuing resolution.    Those cuts had an immediate impact in what we are doing. I have many, many contracts across the agency that require annual funding. If I didn't want to break those contracts, I immediately had to go into areas that I could affect, and I went to testing and I deleted several tests or delayed several tests. The GAO has noted this. And I would say that is a direct result of the sequestration cuts that came down.    In addition, I took further risk on the SM-3 IIA development program and essentially removed all of the development margin in that very important program that must deliver that missile in 2018 to support the Poland deployment. Critical effort.    We are now out of margin. So we are now into the projection of what next in terms of the hypothetical--not even hypothetical--the real possibility of sequestration cuts flowing down to the Missile Defense Agency.    There was a number mentioned yesterday in the Appropriations Committee's hearing of 18 percent, which would mean that I would take a reduction from $8.1 billion to $6.7 billion, over a $1.4 billion reduction. Again, if I maintain my commitment to 44 GBIs by 2017, which is our top priority, and the EPAA commitments that we have made in Europe, there is not many places to go.    So we would immediately go to the efforts that were started last year, which are the redesigned kill vehicle and the long-range discriminator radar, approximately $500 million between those efforts. That would immediately put those on hold or delay those.    And, to me, now you are starting to jeopardize our future capability in terms of what we are able to say to the American people and our ability to defend the homeland. With the development and testing that I see going on with North Korea very specifically and the pace and the progress that they are making, I am in serious jeopardy, without those improvements, of going to the NORTHCOM commander and advising him that the system is overmatched. That would be the path that we are on if we don't do these improvements between now and 2020. The system will be overmatched.    Admiral Syring. Mr. Cooper, I would just add two items that have been touched on as well.    One is force structure with the Navy in terms of the combatant commanders asking the CNO to provide more and more ships, more and more ships, for the ship stations with EPAA, more and more and more, and I see that escalating over the next several years.    CNO and the Navy have other things for those ships to do in terms of sailing with strike groups and protecting the strike groups. I think you see the CNO saying that I don't have the assets in the future to cover all of the requirements from the combatant commanders around the world.    I am just asking for a new strategy in terms of how do we do that? How do we integrate left and right of launch? How do we move this into advanced technology and get on the right side of the cost curve, in his words?    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. Given design stability of that missile and the successes that we have had with intercept and where the predicted reliability is of that missile, we are pushing a multiyear certification authority through the Department to send over here to request multiyear procurement authorization.    We estimated there will be a 14 percent savings over annual procurements, and we view that as a good deal for the American taxpayer and the right thing to do.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. The money requested is not for a full development program. It is to explore the concept. I would like to defer to the classified session on the threat in terms of what that helps us with and helps us counter. And I can go into that.    But suffice it to say, it is necessary. The threat dictates it, in terms of what we are seeing with development, to move that interceptor into a higher-velocity design to help us counter the future threat.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. We have a very in-depth plan that has laid out near-, mid- and far-term objectives that are funded in this year's budget. Those deliveries will start next year to the components of the BMDS.    A critical component that we are requesting this year is the long-range discriminating radar in Alaska, which helps us stay ahead of the threat and makes sure that we are not overmatched in terms of threat complexity that we see developing in North Korea. Critical to that problem.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. Everybody is very familiar with the homeland defense and the operation of that by the Alaska National Guard in terms of protecting our homeland.    The regional defense capability that we fielded in Patriot and THAAD and Aegis go around the world. Thirty-three BMD ships today helping with defense of Japan, helping us when we need them, actually, in defense of the homeland, helping us in the Mediterranean in terms of limited defense of European countries and in the Middle East, in the Gulf there, in terms of the stations that we keep. Those are just the Aegis ships.    I will let General Mann talk about the Patriot deployments on where we are, but we have gone around the world with that capability as well. We continue to expand Aegis, as you know, Mr. Franks, not just at sea, but what it will provide us in Romania and Poland.    As you know, there has been billions of dollars spent on the development of that regional capability with Patriot, THAAD, and Aegis that is now deployed worldwide in all theaters of operation.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. We are actively pursuing a space-based experiment which you are familiar with, and we can talk more about that in the classified session. That is very encouraging to us in terms of what it might provide with technology demonstration on hit and kill assessment, which is vitally important.    Longer term, we and the Air Force and other partners need to think through what is the partnership opportunities for a space-based application in terms of the real persistence and the real discrimination capability that will come from space.    You have heard me say, Mr. Lamborn, you can't just do it all with radars. We have got to get up to space and have that constellation presence over the threat from the west and the east, and you are going to see more thinking from us and our partners on that in future budgets.    Admiral Syring. Sure. There is two applications, obviously, tracking in terms of what that might provide from a space-based solution with laser capability and the maturation of that technology. The other very important part of that technology maturation effort is what it may mean for us scaling up to a boost-phase intercept capability.    Two very promising development efforts ongoing with MIT and Livermore . Both have advantages and disadvantages. We have gone out to industry and asked their ideas in terms of how can we get technology to a demonstration sooner than later.    And I think you will see us pursue that path for really a down-select in the 2018 time period to single up on one technology and one solution for tracking--and I will just leave it at tracking in this forum--and boost-phase intercept.    Admiral Syring. Sir, we've never at MDA spent or received OCO. Obviously, in the base would be better for us, unless there was some rule change that allowed us to do that in an efficient manner. But my preference, sir, would be in base.    Admiral Syring. As currently structured, that is correct. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. No, sir.    Admiral Syring. Sir, we are rapidly--we requested in this budget a significant increase in directed energy. We are requesting over $1.3 billion, both unclassified and classified, funding, which is a several-hundred-million-dollar increase over last year's budget. And I think it is right in terms of the balance of those resources.    Admiral Syring. I will answer the first part and then let Admiral Gortney answer the second part.    The budget request that I have put forward and the additional funding for the GMD program is focused on reliability and improving reliability of the current fleet and the future fleet.    We believe we have the right balance between those two in terms of focusing on what we know about for the current fleet, improving the reliability of those that we are fielding, and then keeping the design going for the new one, which is the RKV , which will be tested well before it is fielded.    Admiral Syring. Sir, we are very busy over the next 2 to--really, 2 to 4 years, and we have 12 tests this fiscal year, for example.    We are going up with a big--our focus is operational testing of capabilities such as Aegis Ashore, which we will test this summer before Romania is fielded in another operational test, before Poland is fielded. To really put it into the tactical combatant commanders' scenario, to completely test an integrated scenario, that is one priority.    The second priority is to continue to test as capability is developed. Aegis is rapidly developing increased capability with their Aegis weapon system baselines and their standard missile evolutions. And then what we don't talk too much about the sea-based terminal defense system, which will be tested this year as well.    THAAD, again, will be tested this summer as part of the integrated strategy of the operational tests, and I think you will continue to see us test that to prove that confidence to the warfighters. So we are testing on all fronts. And it is not just homeland. It is the regional defense systems as well.    Admiral Syring. That would be one lever we would turn.    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir. We have gone out to industry with an RFI--request for information--recently and are assimilating that information and assessing the competitive landscape.    Admiral Syring. Well, let me talk about the radar training device to start with.    That was really a good cost-based decision for us to make that choice. The previous path was to have a full TPY-2 radar there tied up for training. And, really, this training device allows us to do the same thing in terms of providing the soldier training on that device and not tie up a TPY-2 radar. As you know, Mr. Bridenstine, we have five TPY-2 radars forward-deployed and then seven which will go with the seven THAAD batteries.    General Mann. As you know, the THAAD requirement is nine and right now we have the funding for the sixth. And we are working with MDA on that seventh battery. I mean, we are working the force structure.    I think we have a good handle on providing the manning for that. But the equipment, as you well know, is extremely expensive. So where you are able to use a training device and not have to tie up a radar, that is critically important.    Admiral Syring. It would impact delivered BMD capability and it has been accounted for, Mr. Forbes, in the 43 ships that would be delivered by the end of 2020, now given the Navy's plan to reduce five more. But there is an impact to BMD.    Admiral Syring. That is correct, sir.    Admiral Syring. Sir, I am not in a position to make that judgment. I am in a position to say that modifications are the same that are fielded today on ships at sea, and we are not--the baseline is the same, but we have not enabled that capability because it has never been about defense of that site from----    Admiral Syring. Yes, sir.    Admiral Syring. Well, as you know, Mr. Chairman, it dates back to 2002. And the authorities given to MDA were to rapidly develop capability and field to the warfighter based on the urgent need not just with the homeland defense system, but the regional defense systems.    As you know, the homeland defense system was fielded rapidly under those authorities and it was to put a stopgap measure in place for the escalation that we were seeing with North Korea, and it served its purpose.    Now we are back increasing the reliability and increasing the capability of that system, but it allowed us to rapidly field that system. It has also allowed us to rapidly field and test THAAD, which has been fielded and fielded in numbers and I think greatly helped the warfighter in giving them options for deployment to the future.    I would like to say, sir, we are under a tailored 5000 process. So it is not without oversight. We go through a very rigorous process in terms of boards leading up to the quarterly Missile Defense Executive Board at the Mr. Kendall level. The programs are under strict baseline control that I report every year to Congress. So that accountability is there.    The other part of the authority serves in the JCIDS process. And, technically, we are not under----    Admiral Syring. The JCIDS process, the requirements process.    And that said, we are not completely oblivious to that process. We have integrated priorities that are validated by the combatant commanders, NORTHCOM in particular and then STRATCOM at the higher level, that integrates those priorities.    And then the last piece would be--but when we need an integrated requirement with Joint Staff sort of buy-in, we are not hesitant to go do that. And we did that with the homeland defense requirement. As I was starting the radar development, as I was starting the kill vehicle development, we felt it is imperative that we get an overarching requirement from the Joint Staff, and we did that.    Admiral Syring. Mr. Chairman, I see opportunity in terms of the discussion that is going on within the building in terms of integration of left- and right-of-launch capability.    In terms of missile defense, can't be the only measure in terms of how we defeat the threat. We are part of a solution that must be integrated into an overall combatant commander strategy for defense of the homeland and our regional partners.    General Mann. Congressman, the only thing that I would add to that is I think it is critically important that we really leverage partner capabilities. And we know that a lot of countries around the world are buying a lot of technologies and are developing a capability. And so we have different exercises, like Nimble Titan, where we work with NATO and other partners in the GCC and, also, in Korea and Japan.    And this has to be more than just a U.S. solution to global missile defense. We have to move out and really take our game to another level in terms of partnering with our allies, in terms of foreign disclosure, in terms of information-sharing, so that it is more than just the U.S. addressing this global issue.    Admiral Syring. The Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) strategy for procurement of the CE-II Block 1 kill vehicle is to deliver 11 Ground Based Interceptors (GBIs) (one test article for Flight Test GBI (FTG)-15 and 10 operational GBIs) on the Development and Sustainment Contract. This acquisition strategy supports the Secretary of Defense mandate to field and emplace 44 GBIs by the end of 2017.    The MDA strategy for flight testing the CE-II Block 1 kill vehicles consists of two flight tests in advance of fielding the remaining interceptors. The initial flight test, Control Test Vehicle (CTV)-02+, scheduled for December 2015, is a non-intercept flight test of a CE-II kill vehicle, using alternate divert thrusters. The CE-II kill vehicle was successfully demonstrated in Flight Test GBI (FTG)-06b. The second event, an intercept test of a fully configured CE-II Block I interceptor (FTG-15), is scheduled in December 2016.    The MDA considers this strategy low risk for several reasons. First, robust ground testing of all new CE-II Block I components will ensure they meet space vehicle specifications. MDA Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) plans to spend $5.9M for boost vehicle electronics reliability testing in fiscal year (FY) 2016 to support this effort. Second, the commonality between the existing CE-II kill vehicle and the Configuration I Integrated Boost Vehicle lowers risk by utilizing previously qualified flight hardware. GMD plans to spend $3M in FY 2015 and $11.7M in FY 2016 for this effort as part of the Stockpile Reliability Program. Third, MDA's incremental approach to flight testing lowers risk by testing the kill vehicle's alternate divert thrusters in an operational environment (CTV-02+) and validating a fully configured CE-II Block 1 (FTG-15) prior to missile field emplacement.    The intercept flight test in FY 2016 (FTG-15) precedes delivery of the GBIs to the warfighter. All components used in the CE-II Block I kill vehicle and boost vehicle will complete space qualification testing prior to procuring the parts used for manufacturing.    Admiral Syring. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) defers questions regarding deployments of missile defense assets in East Asia to the United States Pacific Command. The United States developed the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, and the Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) missile defense system. These regional systems have demonstrated the ability to provide protection against short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. South Korea and Japan have purchased PATRIOT systems and Japan has Aegis BMD capable ships with Standard Missile (SM)-3 Block IAs in addition to a United States-Japan cooperative effort to develop the Aegis SM-3 Block IIA.    Admiral Syring. Admiral Syring. The Missile Defense Agency plans to award several contracts in fiscal year 2016 to define Multi-Object Kill Vehicle (MOKV). In parallel, we will reduce technical risk in several critical areas. For example, by 2017, we will develop and test command and control strategies in both digital and Hardware-in-the-Loop venues to prove we can manage the engagement of several targets using multiple kill vehicles from a single interceptor.    We will also invest in communication architectures and guidance technology that support this game-changing approach. Ultimately, this capability will revolutionize our missile defense architecture by substantially improving interceptor inventory management in raid scenarios against an evolving and more capable threat to the homeland. We believe MOKV is an essential element in our defense against advanced threats and that it can also decrease cost-per-kill by reducing the number of interceptors required to destroy an incoming reentry vehicle.    Based upon lessons learned from past development efforts, we are employing a disciplined, structured approach to developing this capability. Our plan allows the Agency to first understand the feasibility of potential concepts and ensures we mitigate key technology risks before making a decision to develop the MOKV system.    Admiral Syring. Deployment of Aegis Ashore (AA) provides a dedicated system that would provide a continuous missile defense capability. Any future Japanese purchase and deployment of AA in Japan could free some Japanese Aegis ships to support other Aegis missions (e.g. air defense, cruise missile defense, surface defense and undersea defense) or provide redundancy and capacity when facing a raid of theater-class missiles.    Admiral Syring. Admiral Syring. While ground testing simulates flight test conditions with high confidence, not all flight vibration and shock environments can be replicated exactly in ground testing. Therefore, the risk of not conducting a flight test before producing the SM-3 Block IB would be not being able to identify a potential unique anomaly, which occurs only in flight. However, MDA considers the risk of such a unique anomaly occurring in flight to be low due to comprehensive ground test parameters that are often more stressing than flight conditions.    The total cost per flight test is estimated to be $28M. A ground test of a single TSRM motor at simulated altitude costs approximately     Admiral Syring. Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) reliability is one of the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA's) top priorities. The U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) commander determines the appropriate shot doctrine for homeland defense based on the fielded Ballistic Missile Defense System's capabilities. USNORTHCOM fires multiple GBIs at each threat to ensure high defense effectiveness. Firing multiple GBIs at each threat ensures defense even if GBIs have lower than expected reliability or target the wrong object.    MDA is improving both the GBI reliability and sensor/kill vehicle discrimination to provide the warfighter with confidence of meeting mission requirements with fewer GBIs allocated to each threat. MDA completed a GBI Fleet Assessment last year that pointed out the need for improvements in reliability of the Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle, booster, and ground systems. MDA has introduced an enhanced Stockpile Reliability Program to better understand the service life and reliability of the fielded fleet and is conducting design and reliability analysis on the fielded Capability Enhancement-II GBIs to identify design changes to improve performance. The Redesigned Kill Vehicle program will substantially improve reliability for initial deployment in 2020. The Long Range Discrimination Radar and discrimination improvements for Homeland Defense will provide higher confidence in the GBI selecting the threat warhead. As reliability and discrimination improve, USNORTHCOM can consider changes to shot doctrine which could lead to a lower number of interceptors required to ensure engagement success.    Admiral Syring. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) develops the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) out-year plan in collaboration with the Warfighters. Out-year plans are informed by BMD-focused reviews and Analysis of Alternative studies.    More specifically, the U.S. Strategic Command leads the Warfighter Involvement Process, which generates the Prioritized Capabilities List (PCL). MDA, in turn, responds with an Achievable Capabilities List (ACL). BMDS system-level technical specifications are derived from this Warfighter-initiated set of requirements.    Admiral Syring. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is on schedule to deliver Aegis Ashore in Poland in 2018 to support the European Phased Adaptive Approach Phase 3. At this time, no opportunities exist to accelerate the deployment of Aegis Ashore into 2017. The military construction acquisition is progressing, with planned construction to begin in Poland in early 2016 and completion in late 2017. Due to the critical dependency on completion of military construction, the installation and test of the Aegis Ashore system will begin in late 2017 with a planned 2018 completion. Consequently, there are no requirements for additional SM-3 Block IBs in 2017.    Admiral Syring. The Department of Defense has made no decision to proceed with an additional CONUS Interceptor Site (CIS) at this time. The current Ground Based Interceptor (GBI) sites at Fort Greely, Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, provide the capability necessary to protect the U.S. homeland against present and projected North Korean Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) threats as well as the future Iranian ICBM threat, should it emerge. Upgrading the kill vehicle on the GBI and enhancing the homeland defense sensor network are the priorities for improving protection against limited ICBM attack.    Admiral Syring. MDA's current mission focus is right-of-launch (i.e., active missile defense). Potential left-of-launch questions should be addressed to Office of the Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics).    Admiral Syring. Yes. The GMD program supports the President's Budget. The GMD program has an acquisition and contracting strategy to fully execute the increase in FY16 funding. Increased activity began in FY15 with the addition of $159 million in FY14 Above Threshold Reprogramming funds for work to be performed in FY15.    Admiral Syring. Yes, we are staying ahead of the threat. The Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) is keeping pace with the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile threat. Upgrades to the BMDS include the Long Range Discriminations Radar, the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense Redesigned Kill Vehicle and discrimination improvements that will allow the BMDS to continue to address threat capabilities in the 2020 and 2025 timeframes.    Admiral Syring. Admiral Syring. GMD's changing funding and support over the years, especially the increase from fiscal year (FY) 2015 to FY 2016, has allowed the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to meet its program objectives. Approval of MDA's President's Budget 2016 request is sufficient to improve our ability to provide additional capabilities to the warfighter for homeland defense.    The MDA's FY 2016 budget request will allow us to grow the number of currently deployed Ground Based Interceptor (GBI) fleet to 44 by the end of 2017, continue flight and system ground testing, and continue Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV) development. We will enhance the Stockpile Reliability Program, modify the current booster to increase survivability and hardness to support RKV integration, and expand the battle space to enable later GBI engagements. Additionally, MDA will upgrade the GMD ground system, and deploy upgraded GMD fire control software to enhance our ability to use land-based sensor discrimination data.    Admiral Syring. The Missile Defense Agency is on schedule to fulfill the requirement of 44 GBIs by 2017. Full support of the MDA's Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Request in 2016 and 2017 is required to meet the 44 GBIs by the 2017 timeframe.    Admiral Syring. Admiral Syring. The range of surface-based microwave radars is limited by the curvature of the Earth to approximately 800 km for launch warning. The range of surface-based optical sensors is determined by the presence or absence of clouds.    Surface-based radars provide timely and accurate tracks of threat missiles when they have a direct line of sight to the objects they are tracking. A more distant target must be further above the Earth for a fixed surface sensor to maintain its track. Therefore, surface sensors (either maritime or terrestrial) must be within approximately 800 km of a threat launch to track a substantial portion of its boost phase (needed for warning), and within 1500-2500 km of the launch to provide weapon guidance for timely intercepts. Access to neutral or friendly bases within detection range of potential launch locations may not always be possible, and even where available will always be subject to host nation basing restrictions. Ship-based radars may require advance notice for pre-positioning.    Optical sensors offer greatly improved precision and accuracy relative to microwave radars. Unfortunately, optical sensors cannot see through clouds, which makes them impractical for viewing long range targets from surface locations in most parts of the world.    Space-based sensors can cover much more of the Earth's surface than terrestrial or maritime sensors. Operating above the weather also allows them to use optical sensors that expand the set of measurements available, increasing the reliability of threat warhead identification.    As potential adversaries develop increasingly complex threats it becomes necessary to view the target throughout its flight. The elevation of space platforms enables on-demand global coverage. Obtaining equivalent coverage of the U.S. from surface sensors would require substantially more sensors.    The assessment of space-based sensors to provide tracking and discrimination benefits to the Ballistic Missile Defense System, as well as a broad range of other alternatives, is being considered in the ongoing Ballistic Missile Defense Sensor Architecture Analysis of Alternatives.    Admiral Syring. The benefit of the additional layer of a Directed Energy system would potentially reduce the number of threat missiles in a raid from a known launch point.    Admiral Syring. Fielding of an operational system depends on the combination of laser scaling success and availability of a sensible operational platform. MDA is pursuing the laser scaling effort which could produce an initial viable capability in the 2025 time frame. MDA will work with the Services to identify a suitable operational platform.    Admiral Syring. MDA's PB16 request is adequate for the next phase of Directed Energy development. Funding for an operational system would be beyond the current FYDP.    Admiral Syring. Improving the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system remains the most feasible, near-term alternative for defending the homeland against threats from North Korea. With the President's Budget (PB) for fiscal year 2016, we maintain our commitment to expand our inventory to 44 Ground Based Interceptors (GBI) by the end of 2017, continue flight and system ground testing, develop the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), enhance the Stockpile Reliability Program, modify the current booster to increase survivability and hardness, expand the battle space to enable later engagements, upgrade the ground system, and deploy fire control software that enhances our ability to use discrimination data.    Our overall vision is to shift the calculus of our potential adversaries by introducing directed energy into the Ballistic Missile Defense System architecture for boost phase defense, while also increasing GBI capability, capacity and ability to defeat advanced countermeasures using Multi-object Kill Vehicles. The agency is investing in laser and kill vehicle technologies to achieve this vision.    Our PB 2016 GMD programs and initiatives enable us to keep pace against the North Korean threat to the U.S. homeland.    Admiral Syring. Yes, MDA is using current year (FY15) funds to initiate RKV development and to purchase critical components to support design verification testing. These critical components will be delivered in FY16, and will include E3, temperature, vibration and shock environment testing. We will use FY16 funding to conduct highly accelerated lifecycle testing.    Beginning these activities in FY15, with the purchase of critical components, increases the overall confidence in RKV design and reliability. These activities are required to maintain the program's schedule.    While some unique government facilities will be used to conduct specialized subassembly and payload testing, the majority of our verification activities will be conducted by the Contractor in contractor owned and operated facilities. MDA will issue guidance to the suppliers requiring them to implement rigorous testing methodologies.    Admiral Syring. In November 2014, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) implemented a highly accelerated life test (HALT) and highly accelerated stress screen (HASS) policy for all MDA programs. The policy applies to qualification of all new development efforts and to redesign efforts that require a delta qualification for an existing product baseline.    MDA will initiate HALT testing in the GMD program in FY15, using FY15 funds. GMD plans to spend $5.9 million (M) for Configuration 2 (C2) Boost Vehicle Electronics Reliability Demonstration testing in FY16, which includes the purchase of hardware and test planning activities. After the reliability demonstration, MDA can reuse the C2 components for HALT activities in FY17.    In addition, as part of the Stockpile Reliability Program, MDA is pulling a Capability Enhancement-II (CE-II)/Configuration-I GBI from the fleet in FY15. GMD plans to spend $3M in FY15 and $11.7M in FY16 to support this effort, which includes reverse flow testing, reliability demonstration and HALT activities on the vehicle's electronic components. The table below provides the funds allocation breakout (by year and program element) for MDA's efforts to incorporate HALT/HASS testing.    Also, HALT is included as a requirement in the statement of work for the GMD RKV, the Long Range Discrimination Radar, and the AN/TPY-2 radar AEU T1 Transformer contract request for proposal packages. HALT will be assessed for appropriateness as part of their contract negotiations.    Admiral Syring. Yes, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) considered the potential benefits of implementing the highly accelerated life test and highly accelerated stress screen (HALT/HASS) on possible future MDA programs. MDA Policy Memorandum #77, (November 12, 2014), requires evaluation of HALT/HASS for new development and redesign efforts. For potential new programs such as a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) follow-on effort, a cost/benefit effort will be performed for the implementation of HALT. It will be assessed for appropriateness as part of contract negotiations. The Space-based Kill Assessment (SKA) project started six months before MDA's HALT/HASS policy was established, so contractual documentation did not specifically include HALT/HASS. However, vigorous screening and testing similar to the objectives of HALT/HASS were conducted on SKA as part of the space flight qualification requirements. SKA is hosted on a commercial spacecraft and was qualified against European Space Agency and National Aeronautics and Space Administration stress and parts screening standards.                                 ______                                     Admiral Syring.
