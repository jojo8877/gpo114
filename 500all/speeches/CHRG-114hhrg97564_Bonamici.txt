    Ms. Bonamici. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to the Chairman and Ranking Member for holding this hearing about this important topic, and I--my absence for most of the hearing was only because I was in another hearing. It does not indicate my lack of interest in the subject.    And I'm really glad that we have this, I agree, very incredibly qualified panel and I especially appreciate the gender diversity. As someone who works on education issues and trying to get more women in STEM, thank you for having a balanced panel.    So I missed--a lot of the questions have already been asked but there's a couple of things that I wanted to follow up on. There's been a lot of attention on using gene editing technologies in human embryos, and of course we--with the press from what happened in China, that's getting attention. But I know that a lot of the research is not in human embryos, so could you discuss how the technologies are being used in research today in other areas, including in organisms other than humans? And also can you talk about the potential promise from sectors other than healthcare, energy, for example?    Ms. Bonamici. Terrific. And I know Dr. Dzau wants to----    Ms. Bonamici. Terrific. And I'm going to slightly change the topic.    Dr. Doudna--did I say your name properly?    Ms. Bonamici. I know you cofounded several startup companies and we've had conversations in this Committee before about the challenges in trying to launch companies but also transferring academic research into the marketplace. So can you chat a little bit about that and what the challenges have been and what the Federal Government can do to help with transferring academic research into the marketplace?    Ms. Bonamici. Thank you so much.    And my time is expired. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
