    Mr. Royce. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    In California, as you know, we have a world-class network of startups from Silicon Valley to Orange County, and the issue of access to capital for startup businesses--this is critical. This is critical to our State's economy, but also critical to ensuring that our country remains the best place for entrepreneurs--not only to get the entrepreneurs, but also to bring their products to market.    And so I was going to ask Mr. Keating, because you noted in your testimony that the Micro Offerings Safe Harbor Act, which I am an original cosponsor of, appropriately scale Federal rules and regulatory compliance for small businesses pursuing capital. Mr. Keating, how will this legislation help these startups that are looking for the investment to hire and to grow to enter the market?    Mr. Royce. Right.    Here is another question I am going to ask. I am an advocate for regulatory relief for our Nation's community financial institutions when it comes to their ability to lend. And legislation I have authored, H.R. 1188, the Credit Union Small Business Jobs Creation Act, would free up smaller lenders when it comes to working with business startups.    What role do community financial institutions play in capital formation for startups, and what are the problem areas since the financial crisis, and how could Congress help on that front?    I will go to Mr. Keating, and then to anyone else who wants to jump in.    Mr. Royce. Others on the panel?    Mr. Royce. Even on performing loans. That is the great surprise. Performing assets, and suddenly comes the regulator--    Mr. Royce. --that that just be imploded.    Mr. Royce. Other members of the panel on this subject?    Mr. Royce. The other two panel members on the subject?    Mr. Royce. Yes, yes.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you very much, to the panel.    Mr. Royce. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.
