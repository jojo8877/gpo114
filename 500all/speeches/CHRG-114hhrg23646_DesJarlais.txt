    Mr. DesJarlais. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, panel, for being here.    Mr. Counihan, let's start with the CO-OPs. How many CO-OPs were initially created under the Affordable Care Act?    Mr. DesJarlais. And how many are still active today?    Mr. DesJarlais. Seven. Okay. And we had a hearing in February, and at the time, I think there were 11, so there has been 4 more that have failed since February?    Mr. DesJarlais. About how many individuals have been impacted by the CO-OP closures?    Mr. DesJarlais. I have 870,000. Does that sound right?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. If you and your family were going to buy insurance through one of the remaining CO-OPs, would you think that maybe you should be warned that two-thirds of these CO-OPs have closed in the past year or so?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. Well, President Obama said if you like your plan, you can keep it. But, apparently, if you get a CO-OP, that's not necessarily the case. You got a two-out-of-three chance that you're going to lose your insurance. So you're saying you would still recommend people and their families to go to the CO-OPs to obtain insurance?    Mr. DesJarlais. The two-thirds that have failed, they weren't certified and licensed by the State?    Mr. DesJarlais. Well, you painted a pretty rosy picture of the successes of the healthcare law. Our chairman tended to disagree. Mr. Cartwright said that we're enjoying a historically low uninsured rate. What is the historical low, and what year was that noted or documented?    Mr. DesJarlais. And what's the historical low? Do we know? I'd asked this question before dating back to 1950, and no one knew, and they were supposed to get back to me, but they never did.    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. So how many people are uninsured now in America? What percentage?    Mr. DesJarlais. Is that taking into account the people who have lost their insurance because they couldn't afford premiums? Has there been any study? I guess I would like to know where we got this data. The chairman mentioned that 11 million had insurance. You're saying 20 million. What did President Obama say was uninsured when we needed this law?    Mr. DesJarlais. So the average person has not really been helped then by the healthcare law that has to pay for it with the increased deductibles and increased premiums. We don't really have a study showing how many are just opting to pay the tax that the Supreme Court ruled was not a penalty but a tax. Do we have any studies indicating how many people have just opted out of the insurance and chosen to pay the tax?    Mr. DesJarlais. I get the talking points. You're in a parallel universe with what I'm hearing. We hear different things back home, but I appreciate and respect your right to have an opinion. I just don't know that those can be backed on facts.    Now, we had $1.6 billion in loan money that was given out. Dr. Mandy Cohen was here before, and she said that we're going to recoup this. I asked, why didn't they just call them grants, because I don't think we have any real chance of getting them back? Now she said that they were very much loans, and we expect to get these taxpayer dollars back from these failed CO-OPs. And at the time, she had just started. Can you give us an update of how successful the recoupment efforts have been?    Mr. DesJarlais. A half year later, we still have no update on how we're going to recoup the $1.6 billion to these failed CO-OPs. This is taxpayer money, and they have a right to know.    Mr. DesJarlais. So I'm just about of time, but I guess I tend to agree with the chairman. We have seen 24 turn to 23 to 11. Now we have seven, and you're telling people they should still go use these CO-OPs with confidence that their family can get insurance, and they're not going to lose it, and then you're also trying to tell them that we're going to recoup the money from all these failed businesses. I have an idea we'll probably be having this hearing again in a few months, and I anticipate, unfortunately, the chairman's predictions will come true, but we'll see where we're at. I would like to get the data on the numbers where you're saying 20 million are now uninsured, and I'd like to see how many people have lost their insurance because that's what I tend to hear back home, not the successes that the both of you have laid out for us today.    I yield back.    Mr. DesJarlais. I guess I'm going to kind of follow up where Representative Meadows was on numbers. You are saying that 20 million people now have insurance. What percentage of that is Medicaid expansion?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. So what did President Obama claim we had in terms of the number of uninsured when he was proposing his healthcare law?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. And we have 300 and some odd million people in the country, so 40, 45 million people.    Mr. DesJarlais. So what we have done is we have doubled the number of people on Medicaid, and of the other 10 million that now have insurance, how many of those have significant subsidies?    Mr. DesJarlais. I can see where the cash flow problem might be coming from then, because only just a million and a half then are actually paying for their health care or a small number, small percent?    Mr. DesJarlais. Did we ever figure out how many people--there are people that are living here illegally that are getting health care, correct?    Mr. DesJarlais. It seemed like there was an estimate of--I don't remember--10, 15 million people possibly that were getting that, but you don't know?    Mr. DesJarlais. We're talking about the cost of deductibles. Even President Obamaacknowledged that too many Americans are straining to pay other physicians for their deductibles and costs. And I think somewhere that you said the deductibles have decreased $850. We have heard numbers thrown around here upward of $5,000 is the deductible cost. Why the discrepancy? That's a big difference.    Mr. DesJarlais. That's the median. And that's for the people who are being subsidized, the 10 million who are not getting Medicaid expansion?    Mr. DesJarlais. So, basically, healthcare costs have gone up for about 90 percent, maybe even 95 percent, of Americans because of ObamaCare?    Mr. DesJarlais. You're saying that healthcare costs have gone down?    Mr. DesJarlais. And the CO-OPs are going broke, and there's been money that's come out. The Court ruled that the Obama administration was using funds to subsidize insurance companies that it wasn't authorized to do. That's probably a topic for another hearing.    Ms. Blumberg, you're talking about access to care. I practiced medicine for 20 years. I know if you're on Medicaid, you essentially have no deductible. You can go to the ER. You can go to a clinic, but if you have private insurance, if you go to the ER, your deductible might be $300, $400 or more. So, even if you have an emergency, you can't afford to go to the ER, so you might wait to the next day to come see the doctor. I know I've seen that happen. Now people have deductibles up to $5,000. Middle class folks are not going to the doctor, and they're not seeking to get care, so their quality of care is actually going down. We have helped some people. We have helped some people. As you've said, we've helped people get Medicaid, and we have helped subsidize people, but there's a whole lot of other people hurting because they can't afford to go to the doctor, or they won't go to the doctor, and they let problems fester because of that high deductible. What would you say to them?    Mr. DesJarlais. Are you talking Medicaid or private insurance?    Mr. DesJarlais. I'd like to see those numbers.    Mr. DesJarlais. Mr. Counihan, quickly, how many people now--ObamaCare has been around for a while. How many people have paid the penalty on their IRS taxes rather than getting health care? In other words, how many people had health care that have dropped their health care and opted to pay the taxes?    Mr. DesJarlais. Can you ballpark? Can you guess?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. We still have 10 percent uninsured by your number.    Mr. DesJarlais. Nine percent. Okay. So that is roughly 30 million people. Who are they?    Mr. DesJarlais. Who are the 30 million people that don't have insurance? If 10 percent are still uninsured and we have all of these other people that now have insurance, who are the ones that don't have it?    Mr. DesJarlais. Yeah. It's really expensive for young people. I know that by talking to them. But I think what we've done is shifted health care. Some people that didn't have health care where now they get subsidized, but a large group of people that had health care can't afford it now, so they are paying taxes to the IRS and going without insurance. And the ones that do have high deductibles and they can't get health care because they are afraid they have to spend their deductible. But somehow you both seem to think this is a success; not at all what we are hearing back home.    Mr. DesJarlais. But that's going to make the overall program--any time you give cash subsidies to somebody, it makes it way more expensive somewhere else. Right?    Mr. DesJarlais. Sounds like socialized medicine. Thank you.
