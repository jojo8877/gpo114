    Mr. Davis. Thank you to the panel and thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I too, Dr. Jones, had questions about veterans. And if you have anything to add in regards to how your programs or how H.R. 6020 would help recruit veterans, I mean, you are more than welcome to expand on your first answer, if you would.    Mr. Davis. Are these veterans usually using the GI Bill?    Mr. Davis. Besides the funds, what is your institution doing to help recruit veterans?    Mr. Davis. Okay. Well, thank you. It seems like your success is showing. We appreciate what you are doing there.    I guess I will ask the rest of the panel questions on what are your thoughts, Dr. Bell, on the state of our competitive award programs, from AFRI to the other small competitive programs?    Mr. Davis. You would be in favor of them investing more in capital?    Mr. Davis. I guess I have a question for myself while we are on this. In the competition for USDA grants, is it any different relative to the competition for other agencies funding, like NIH or NSF?    Mr. Davis. Somebody is raising their hand back there. I missed the first panel, sir, so I didn't get your name.    Mr. Davis. Thank you very much. Thank you to the panel.    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.    Mr. Allen, 5 minutes.
