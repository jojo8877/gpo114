    Mr. Gaffigan. Mr. Chairman, the--we have some ongoing work. We haven't been looking at the park service in a long time. There are 407 different park units throughout the country ranging from Yosemite to small little sites like the Rosie the Riveter historic sites.    Mr. Gaffigan. I didn't want to be--I didn't want to be too obvious.    Mr. Gaffigan. Yeah. There----    Mr. Gaffigan. Yeah and, you know, they're struggling to deal with what they have right now. And this is our first look at it in a while. Because the only sources of revenue come from potential park fees, concessions. And--and they're really struggling to deal with what they have right now. So we have some ongoing work looking at that issue right now.    Mr. Gaffigan. Mr. Dodaro is correct. They haven't coordinated since 2007. So our recommendation was they come up with a memorandum of agreement to start working better together.    Mr. Gaffigan. I believe, most of the time, they know they're coming, but I can get you an official answer for the record.    Mr. Gaffigan. Yes.    Mr. Gaffigan. I think it's in that 2004 or 2007 range.    Mr. Gaffigan. These are the two that will do lab inspections looking at the good laboratory practices, which as you mentioned are very similar in their criteria. So there are other labs and other inspections, but this has the specific purpose to ensure that they have good laboratory practices.    Mr. Gaffigan. Congressman, just to clarify your question that they had the agreement from 1984 to 2004, although they kept meeting until 2007.    Mr. Gaffigan. I'd be surprised if it includes that. It's very hard to measure these things after it reply--and rely on the industry, self-reporting, but I do know that the numbers Mr. Dodaro was quoting was based on the work we did in December of 2014, the 140-plus days, that's increased, and we think it's over 200 days at this point and----    Mr. Gaffigan. Right. We looked at it this morning, and $56 is what it is based on. But still if you look at--and it's--the other part of this is it's based on the net imports. So when we did the analysis in 2014, it was based on net imports for 2013. Looking at net imports for 2014, the number of days has increased as well. So, while the price has dropped some, the number of days beyond the 90 has increased substantially.
