    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Cooper, in my district, farmers' markets that participate in SNAP have, at times, encountered challenges. And I wanted to ask about your experience with this. And despite efforts, I read in your testimony, your knowledge of these issues, and I wanted to see what do you think might be the cause? Despite our best efforts, and some of our recruitment for these farmers' markets, and offering that access to folks, what can we do to improve that access? And I have some questions for Dr. Hesterman and Dr. Wright as well.    Mr. Aguilar. True. Thank you. Dr. Hesterman and Dr. Wright, your matching programs are incredibly interesting to read about. In southern California, my district is different than Mr. Crawford's, but to follow up what the Chairwoman had mentioned as well, the philanthropic efforts are huge, and a huge component to what you have described where they matched. Dr. Wright, you mentioned that they have been matched with public dollars, as well as private. Who was the first money in? Who were the first folks? Was it $5,000, or $10,000, or was it bigger denominations? Please talk to me about the mix of the public and private from the matching perspective.    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you so much. Thank you, Madam Chair.    The Chairwoman. Mr. Benishek, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
