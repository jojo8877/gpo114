    Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I'm excited about this hearing, because we're exploring the value of first work, and then also the engagement with government programs and also private employers. The key piece there is the engagement. We've seen, as you all have testified, the positive results with engagement, in those too. And I've been particularly pretty impressed with the testimony from Mr. Brame and also Ms. Larrea, in regards to the boots on the ground, I guess, and actually seeing first hand of people getting front line jobs. And a lack of work or limited work as we all know is the number one cause of poverty.    And representing a Congressional district by some that would say it's the 18th poorest in the country, this is something that is very important to me. Mr. Brame, what I would like to ask you, it seems that the Michigan Department of Human Services really values your company's partnership to help them move individuals off of welfare and into full-time employment. Was that always the way?    Mr. SMITH. So it was awkward. Did you--did Cascade have to persuade DHS to be involved, or just they had to get----    Mr. SMITH. What advice would you give other states who are trying to work with their Human Service Agencies that may be a little apprehensive about it?    Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
