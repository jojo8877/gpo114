    Ms. Bass. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.    First of all, you know, my heart goes out to the family of the 13-year-old child. I can't imagine what they must be going through right now. But, yeah, I am so concerned about the cycle of violence, and I hope that this atrocity doesn't lead to revenge killings like we have seen.    And I think both Mr. Wexler and Dr. Pollock have talked about the generals and the desire of the generals to see a different policy. And I wanted to know if you could expand on that a little bit.    A couple of my colleagues have mentioned--and I believe you did too, Dr. Pollock--about the policy of destroying homes--and I would imagine the home of the 17-year-old might get destroyed--and then the policy of the PA of giving money to families that have committed these acts.    So when a house is blown up, then where does that family go? And is that an example of the money that the PA uses? I mean, what happens to--you never hear about that. And you also mentioned other examples of houses being, you know, dismantled because of building codes or whatever. What happens to those families?    Ms. Bass. Is there any evidence of this?    Ms. Bass. Is this a practice that the 200 generals are against?    Ms. Bass. I believe both of you have made reference to settlements and saying that more settlements shouldn't be approved. But weren't more settlements just approved in the last couple days?    Ms. Bass. Thank you.
