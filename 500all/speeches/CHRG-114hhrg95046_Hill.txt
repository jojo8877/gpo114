    Mr. Hill. I appreciate the opportunity. Thank you, witnesses, for being with us today. I want to associate myself with the remarks of Mr. Delaney from Maryland on those of us who come to Congress from the private sector who spend hours and hours of personnel time trying to comply with a myriad of government regulations and duties and responsibilities. And I thought he summarized that quite well.    Mr. Montoya, is there a whistleblower program at HUD?    Mr. Hill. Is each cabinet agency required, under OPM requirements, to have an independent whistleblower process connected to their Departmental IG, for example?    Mr. Hill. And how long have you been at HUD? Remind me.    Mr. Hill. Have you been at another cabinet agency before that?    Mr. Hill. So how does the whistleblower activity at HUD compare to previous places you have been? Are there more complaints?    Mr. Hill. Yes, because the private sector--since Sarbanes-Oxley, of course--all have the public companies all have responsibility under whistleblower statutes. So I am not sure the government would be very accommodating or thoughtful in a response like that if it were a private sector player. Who is the executive officer at HUD responsible for H.R. policy?    Mr. Hill. It is surprising to me that you don't know that, as a part of this investigation. Wouldn't the Assistant Secretary or Undersecretary for Administration responsible for the Department's H.R. practices be somebody you would have questioned in your investigation?    Mr. Hill. So do you think that is a weakness, a management weakness, in the Department that they don't have an overall personnel person who oversees this in all their independent--quasi-independent Departments or agencies?    Mr. Hill. Do you think the idea of an IPA as a concept has been taken advantage of here in this particular instance? And do you think that this merits a more systematic overview by Congress in the use of the IPAs by Executive Branch agencies?    Mr. Hill. Does the Office of Personnel Management have some responsibility in setting the best practices for use of IPAs across cabinet agencies?    Mr. Hill. Were the actions at HUD reported to OPM, and did they take any action in the process of reviewing this particular matter?    Mr. Hill. I would appreciate it if you would sort of respond to my line of questioning on IPAs, what the best practice policy is from OPM on that. And then I would be very interested in the results of your review of the other 16 at     Mr. Hill. Thank you for your service to your country.    And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
