    Mr. Carson. Thank you, Chairman LoBiondo and Ranking Member Larsen. This is for all the witnesses. Congress previously imposed a moratorium to prevent the FAA from issuing more robust regulations on the operational safety of commercial spaceflight until 2023. And the rationale was, essentially, to avoid overregulating an emerging industry in its infancy.    Do you think that this moratorium needs to be revisited? And should it end earlier or be extended? Based on what is actually happening in the industry today, what do you all think about updating the operational safely rules currently in place?    Mr. Carson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
