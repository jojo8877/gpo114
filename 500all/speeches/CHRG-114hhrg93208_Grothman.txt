    Mr. Grothman. Thanks much. I have been concerned about this issue for a long time. And the more the government collects data of any sort--you know, we have seen every agency. Eventually, it is going to get out somewhere. And this is supposed to be confidential data. So it is a scary thing.    But Mr. Reidenberg just said something kind of shocking. And I want you to repeat for me, because I almost fainted, so I didn't hear the whole thing.    The percentage of vendors who are getting, apparently partly in compensation for what they are doing, are sending out data? Could you elaborate on that a little bit?    Mr. Grothman. Can you give me an example of that information they are getting?    Mr. Grothman. So in other words, if Google wants to sell a product and my niece is working on something on who knows what, they are gonna know what she has chosen for her, whatever, middle school project or something?    Mr. Grothman. What else would they be doing with it?    Mr. Grothman. And so these people, in addition to the garden variety government employees--well, Ms. Sevier, do you want to--    Mr. Grothman. I am gonna--    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Well, we will--I have got a broader question.    Mr. Grothman. Well, I am 59 years old. I grew up without all this stuff, and I don't feel like I missed anything. But be that as it may, maybe I did. Maybe I would be so much better off if they had a big data bank to peruse.    Mr. Reidenberg, one quick question. By the time I am--let's say I go graduate school, so we got all this stuff. Or like I did, I went to law school. And this stuff was in place from the time I was 3 years old in day care to 25 years old in law school. What all--could you give us like a 1-minute summary of all the stuff that would be in one place that somebody could fine out about me? You know, that we all have to have, the program has to be of?
