According to verified voting, approximately 3/4 of voters in November will be using voting machines with a paper record of their vote. And I'm--just share a concern perhaps about the potential for mishaps or potential hacking for the voting machines with no paper trail. Can you please describe the role auditability plays in elections and the impact individual voters casting their vote?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you.

And so you--there are the paper ballots that you're devising an audit process for?    Mr. Tonko. What are some of those factors in that audit that you absolutely see essential? What--have you looked at other States and what they might be doing or----    Mr. Tonko. Thank you very much. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
