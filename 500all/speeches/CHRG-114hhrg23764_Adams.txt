    Ms.ADAMS. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Ranking Member Velazquez. I thank my colleague, Ms. Clarke, for making that notation.    Gentlemen, thank you for being here, and I certainly want to add my words of commendation to the late Mark Takai. I lived in the same building as well and met him regularly in the mornings downstairs in the lobby as he was waiting to be picked up, and we had many conversations along the way. We are certainly going to miss him and his bright smile. But certainly, a tribute to all of the work that he did for the people that he served, and I just wanted to add my words of thanks and appreciation to him.    The HUBZone program is critically important in encouraging small businesses to build and operate in economically disadvantaged communities across our country. I do have a few questions, and I want to start with Administrator Shoraka.    If you could just walk us through the certification process for small businesses looking to become part of the HUBZone program, I would appreciate that.    Ms.ADAMS. Okay. So what about the recertification process? If you could identify some of the inefficiencies that exist within the process.    Ms.ADAMS. Thank you. And maybe, Mr. Shear, can someone speak to how the program services businesses in rural versus the urban areas and the challenges that exist there?    Ms.ADAMS. All right. Thank you, sir. I am out of time. I apologize, Mr. Chair.
