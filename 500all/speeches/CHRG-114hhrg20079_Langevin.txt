    Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Lehman and Admiral Natter, thank you both for your service to our country and for your testimony here today.    For both of you, I don't disagree with anything you have said in terms of strength, in terms of where we were, and where we are. The challenge, of course, that we have and the circumstances were different back when you were there and where we are now, is the significant national debt that--the annual budget deficits and a crushing national debt that we have to contend with, which in itself, is a threat to U.S. national security--both short-term rate and long term.    So given those circumstances, you know, what is your guidance and advice to how we now balance those realities with the priorities that we have in being able to defend the country and have the size force that we actually need given the, you know, the budget realities that we are in?    Mr. Langevin. All right. I appreciate both of your insights, your testimony here today. I know my time has expired, but I take your words to heart and I thank you for what you have imparted to the committee today.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
