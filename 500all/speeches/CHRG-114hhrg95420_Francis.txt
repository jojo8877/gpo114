    Mr. Francis. Good afternoon. Yes. So what Mr. Dodaro just said, on the efficiencies, we found that, for a major milestone decision it takes 2 years for programs to get all the documents lined up for that, 5,600 staff days. And we find half of that time is reviewing documents, not preparing them.    Mr. Francis. The ones we looked at are for the big programs.    Mr. Francis. And I think we did a survey about half--the participants in the process view about half of the documents as having high value. The rest not. And about 10 percent of the reviews are considered to be high value. So there's a lot that could be streamlined there.    Then on the other programs, the issue there is getting a good start, having a good business case to start a program. And that's where best practices and other techniques could really take hold. We get programs started that are underestimated at the beginning. They are too technically ambitious at the start. And it's years after a program is underway that reality sets in and we report on these cost increases.    So, the easy answer is there's practices that we could employ to get programs started earlier. The real challenge is the acquisition culture. So I think a common way of looking at the acquisition process is to say it's broken and needs to be fixed. But I'd ask you to look at it a little differently. I think it's in equilibrium. I think all the players kind of get what they want out of it, and the cost we pay in terms of additional time and money is just the cost of doing business. So, we have to have a process that does a better job of saying no when no is to be said. But our process prefers to say yes.
