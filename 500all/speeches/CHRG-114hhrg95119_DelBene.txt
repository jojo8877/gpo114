    Ms. DelBene. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Thanks to all of you for being here today. We appreciate your time.    I kind of have a question for everyone, and so we will see how we go here, but it could be argued that one of the strengths of administrative litigation is the ability of the Commission to consider novel legal theories and employ innovative forms of economic analysis, things that the DOJ may not be able to do.    So how does the Commission use of innovative evidence and novel legal theories advance antitrust law, especially in today's complex and rapidly changing digital economy where there may not be precedents out there to rely on?    I guess I will start with you, Ms. Garza.    Ms. DelBene. Part of, I think, the question has been around having people who have expertise in a given area and understanding, and are able to bring that expertise to the table, especially on a newer industry or newer type of technology.    Ms. DelBene. Okay. Mr. Foer, if I could get your feedback on that?    Ms. DelBene. Thank you.    Also, Mr. Foer, I think in your testimony you had talked about any concern about the SMARTER Act reaching transactions other than proposed Hart-Scott-Rodino mergers, so I wondered what your thoughts were on that and whether you think the bill would apply to other things like consummated transactions or non-merger activity, or move into that area.    Ms. DelBene. Thank you.    And I yield back my time, or I am out of time. Thanks.
