    Mr. Connelly. Would the gentlelady ----    Mr. Connelly. And, Ms. Rectanus, in your testimony you state, ``The Postal Service's financial condition continues to deteriorate'' and you attribute that to ``declining mail volume and growing expenses at the same time,'' is that correct?    Mr. Connelly. And yet do you believe that some of the elements of the reform we have been talking about, freeing up the Postal Service to, you know, engage in some other lines of business that may be profitable like other postal services around the world do, so lifting some of those restrictions, lifting the burden of a unique prepayment requirement, as Mr. Rolando pointed out, unique to the Postal Service. No other Federal agency, no other private corporation in America is held to that standard in terms of that prepayment. And it is, you know, whatever it is, $5 billion plus, plus the Medicare reform I think we have been talking about, which I wish Mr. Farenthold were still here. That is not a taxpayer giveaway. Postal workers have paid $29 billion for a service they don't participate in, benefit from yet. Those things, could they turn around that financial description you have offered in your report?    Mr. Connelly. Well ----    Mr. Connelly. If the chairman will allow the postmaster general to comment on that as well, and then I will be done. I thank the chair.    Mr. Connelly. Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Connelly. Thank you, Ms. Kelly.
