    Mr. Neugebauer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Chairwoman Matz, there has been a lot of discussion about what it means for a bank to be systemically important. And as you know, in February the Office of Financial Research (OFR) released a report where they examined the systemic risk indicators. They used the indicators that had been developed by the Basel Committee and they applied those to some of the largest banks and holding companies.    And what was kind of an interesting finding is that the report concluded that the least systemic US GSIB was several times more systemically--more systemic than the other major U.S. banks, the regional banks. Yet, all of those institutions fall under the requirement for enhanced prudential standards based on their asset size. And so are you familiar with that report?    Mr. Neugebauer. You have not seen that report?    Mr. Neugebauer. One of the requirements is--or, I guess, main functions of the OFR is to furnish the committee with the information to hopefully help them make better determinations. And so I would hope that you would avail yourself of that report.    But would you agree that setting up certain standards to measure companies is appropriate? If you haven't seen the report, basically they took the Basel standards and they took five of them and applied them to those companies. Do you think that is a good way to approach that?    Mr. Neugebauer. Director Watt, have you seen the OFR report?    Mr. Neugebauer. Well, let me--since you haven't read the report, I guess I will go to another line of questions. Section 113 of Dodd-Frank requires FSOC voting members to consider at least 11 factors before designating a non-bank financial company for heightened Federal supervision including leverage, off-balance sheet exposures, scope, size, and scale.    I will start with you, Chairwoman Matz. Do you think it is appropriate to use 11 different factors in the determination of whether a non-bank company is systemically important?    Mr. Neugebauer. Director Watt, would you agree with that?    Mr. Neugebauer. I think the point I am trying to make here is that it is a little puzzling to me that it is appropriate for non-bank entities to be subject to standards. And I think, in fact, Director Watt, you said you are committed to an analytical process.    And so, I think the interesting thing is, is we subject these non-bank SIFIs to 11 different factors. Yet, we only subject banks to one factor, and that is size. If this is going to be an analytical process, shouldn't we establish factors for analyzing banks in a way of analyzing whether or not they are systemically risky?    Mr. Neugebauer. Yes. I am not talking about non-banks. We have talked about what--    Mr. Neugebauer. I guess the question is, we are subjecting banks, based on their size; we don't even consider the other factors. So, shouldn't we be considering a litany of factors to determine whether these banks should be subject to enhanced prudential standards?    Mr. Neugebauer. But you do sit on FSOC, isn't that correct?
