    Mr. Welch. I thank the gentleman. The issue here is not so much whether GMOs are safe. The issue is whether individual purchasers, consumers, who purchase food have a right to know that GMOs are part of the food they are buying. It is a consumer right-to-know issue. I agree with my colleagues that a national standard would be good, but there is no national standard in this bill. It is a voluntarily labeling, which means there will be no labeling whatsoever.    Many states are reflecting the desires of their consumers to basically know what is in the product they are buying, and the consumer has the right to do that. They just do. And this legislation is ironic in this sense: If GMOs are so safe, and I am not here to challenge that assertion, but if they are so safe, why not label so that folks who are getting what the manufacturers assert is so safe know that their product will be labeled and consumers can then make their own decision. My question really is, if they are so safe, why would anyone be afraid of labeling those products so that consumers would have a right to know?    Now, in Vermont we have our assistant attorney general here, Todd Daloz, who is going to talk about what we have done in Vermont. Three States have passed labeling laws. Several others are considering them. There have been referendums that almost passed in California and it is reflecting this groundswell of desire that consumers have to know what is in the products that they are buying.    Now, I am going to play a little unfair here, Mr. Chairman, because I am here today to give Mr. Pompeo----    Mr. Welch . And Mr. Butterfield a GMO free labeled pint of the most nutritious product on planet earth, and that is Ben and Jerry's ice cream. And this is labeled, and it sells. People love this.    I will yield back.
