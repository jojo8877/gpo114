    Mrs. Torres. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, both of you, for being here. I appreciate having some time to talk about this very tragic event that happened. While we can argue about how this came about, I think it is also important to note the persistent problems that we have of abandoned hardrock mine lands, and the negative impact that they have, and will continue to have, on our water resources.    The problem of abandoned hardrock mines is not going to go away. As we consider ways to reform our outdated mining laws, can you expand on existing programs that address other types of abandoned mines, such as coal, and recent budget cuts?    Can you also speak to the impact that that has had on further ongoing investigations?    Mrs. Torres. Yes. As you continue to develop a work plan and work with members of this committee to do that, I would really like to piggyback on a comment that was made by Mr. Young--and that is to help tribes be a part of the solution on mines that are within their jurisdiction. I think having their input and having their expertise, or helping them gain that expertise, is equally important.    Is there something else that you want to add? I know that several Members asked you questions that you have not been able to answer, and I would like to give you 2 minutes to answer that for the record.    Mrs. Torres. With limited budget resources--these are not folks that you can just get off the street and train, right? I mean they require a great deal of education and expertise. I would also say that it is somewhat criminal that we would continue to diminish a budget of the EPA or other organizations that we task with our water quality safety.    I ran out of time, so I will yield back the last 2 seconds.    The Chairman. Actually, you owe me four now.    Mr. McClintock.
