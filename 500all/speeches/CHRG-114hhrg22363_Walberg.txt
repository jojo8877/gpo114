    Mr. Walberg. The gentlelady's time has expired.    Mr. Walberg. I thank the gentlelady.    Mr. Walberg. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning.    Let me ask Ms. Archuleta, what do you believe was the intent behind the attack? We are talking all about the attack. So what do you think the intent was?    Mr. Walberg. Ms. Seymour, maybe you could respond?    Mr. Walberg. Let me start, Ms. Seymour, do you have any idea as to why the attack?    Mr. Walberg. Ms. Barron-DiCamillo?    Mr. Walberg. Ms. Archuleta, how would you assess OPM's communication with current and former Federal employees regarding the breach?    Mr. Walberg. At this point in time, how would you assess it?    Mr. Walberg. Federal News Radio conducted an online survey about the data breach. You probably are aware of this. One of the questions asked respondents was to rate OPM's communication with current and former Federal employees about the data breach. The results showed that 78 percent of the respondents rated that OPM's communication as poor. An additional 12 percent rated it as fair. Only 3 percent described it as good. And less than 1 percent said it was excellent. I appreciate the fact that you want to improve that. We expect you to make sure that who you have contracted with improves that.    Mr. Walberg. Let me move on.    Ms. Barron-DiCamillo, some news reports indicate that attackers may now be in possession of the personal file of every Federal employee, every Federal retiree, and up to 1 million former Federal employees. If true, that means the hackers have every affected person's Social Security number, address, date of birth, job and pay history, and more that could be there. For years we have been hearing about the risk of a cyber Pearl Harbor. Is this a cyber Pearl Harbor?    Mr. Walberg. Significant impact. What does ``significant impact'' mean?    Mr. Walberg. The ``environment'' meaning?    Mr. Walberg. So it's blown up.    Mr. Walberg. It's blown up a lot of things, protection, security. It's a Pearl Harbor.    Mr. Walberg. It's pretty significant.    Mr. Walberg. Let me ask, Ms. Seymour, do you think issuing a request for quotes on May 28 and establishing a deadline of May 29 to potential contractors was a reasonable opportunity to respond in this significant issue of cybersecurity?    Mr. Walberg. That was quick. Maybe too quick. My time has expired.    I now recognize the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Lynch.
