    Mr. Stutzman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I appreciate the witnesses being here today. I apologize for being late and catching up here on a couple of things.    But I want to talk a little bit about--I don't know if you all talked about the municipal bonds already, but if you have, I will move over to H.R. 2473, the Preserving Capital Access and Mortgage Liquidity Act of 2015. Can some of you talk a little bit about why H.R. 2473 is necessary and related to the community financial institution definitions, if any of you could be able to discuss that a little bit?    Mr. Stutzman. Do you think there is a sound policy reason for not including credit unions in that definition?    Mr. Stutzman. Mr. Ireland or Mr. Stanley, would you like to comment on that?    Mr. Stutzman. All right. Thank you.    Could any of you mention or discuss a little bit about the possibility that the lack of exemption for small credit unions increases the possibility that current members in good standing will risk having their membership involuntarily terminated?    Mr. Stutzman. Has the cap on asset size for community financial institutions been increased before?    Mr. Stutzman. Do you think Congress is the best place to address this issue?    Mr. Stutzman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
