    Mr. Salmon. Subcommittee will come to order.    First of all and foremost, my heart goes out to Taiwan as it deals with the aftermath of the shocking magnitude 6.4 earthquake on February 6th that claimed 63 lives and injured 551, and that was in the city of Tainan, where I lived for 7 months, and I have a really special place in my heart for the people of Tainan.    I am so saddened to hear about the damage that the earthquake wreaked and I know I am joined with my colleagues of the subcommittee in continuing to support Taiwan in this difficult time.    Today, we celebrate Taiwan's democracy, given its recent Presidential and parliamentary elections in January. In this regional context, Taiwan's free and fair elections, vibrant free market economy and open society have definitely set an example for the region and for the world.    With the Democratic Progressive Party, DPP, victory, the party has won its first ever absolute majority in the Legislative Yuan which until--which has until now been controlled by the Kuomintang, KMT. President-elect Tsai Ing-wen will also be Taiwan's first female President and I think that is pretty exciting.    This third peaceful transfer of executive power is an indication of the maturation of Taiwan's democracy. The recent election presents the United States with more opportunities to improve our political security and economic relationship with Taiwan.    We are here to parse out the priorities of President-elects Tsai's administration and understand the prospects and potential for the U.S., Taiwan and the cross-Strait relationships and to discuss how the United States can continue to honor our commitments to Taiwan. I look forward to hearing from our distinguished witnesses on these important issues.    The cross-Strait relationship has been relatively stable under the sitting Kuomintang President Ma Ying-jeou. President Ma took strides to build closer relationships with China, especially in trade.    To his credit, President Ma negotiated the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement, ECFA, with China in 2010 and this paved the way for Taiwan's expanded trade ties under similar economic cooperation agreements with New Zealand and Singapore.    The suspension on the cross-Strait Trade in Services Agreement, TISA, as a result of domestic protests in 2014 may have indirectly contributed to China's tightening on further trade agreements between Taiwan and other countries.    With slow economic development, untapped potential due to political constraints and heavy reliance on trade, I look forward to hearing from our distinguished panels, especially our administration witness, about Taiwan's economic and trade prospects and how the United States can help Taiwan overcome some of these challenges.    I also worry about the potential for cross-Strait stability as China has not hesitated to remind us that it is still willing to use military force against Taiwan.    Of note, China continues to press President-elect Tsai and her administration to acknowledge the 1992 consensus, something President Ma has adhered to.    President-elect Tsai will continue to face pressure here, given her party's own interpretation of the agreement. Despite underscoring her intention to maintain the status quo and saying there won't be provocation and there won't be surprises, we cannot say the same for China.    A steady stream of threats toward Taiwan's national security are an everyday reality for Taiwan and its people and I hope our panelists can shed light on how we can continue to support Taiwan's security under the Taiwan Relations Act and through increased cooperation.    I admire outgoing President Ma and all that he was able to accomplish for Taiwan. I look forward to seeing how we can continue to work with President Tsai for the mutual benefit of the United States and Taiwan.    Members of Congress have always shared a strong interest in supporting Taiwan's security and democracy. Having lived there for a few years myself while serving a church mission, I am one of its big supporters--hopefully, its biggest.    At a time when Taiwan's presence in the international arena is constantly being threatened, at a time when Taiwan's security is not insured from coercion and potential attacks, I urge our administration to continue to support Taiwan.    We must prioritize Taiwan's active and meaningful participation on the global stage, ensure its self-defense capabilities are sufficient and ensure that its economy continues to grow vibrantly and compete with other major powers in the region.    Members present today are going to be permitted to submit written statements to be included in the official hearing record.    Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 5 calendar days to allow for statements, questions and extraneous material subject to the length limitation in the rules.    And I am going to recognize Chairman Royce and then Ranking Member Sherman.    Mr. Salmon. Thank you.    The chair recognizes the ranking member, Mr. Sherman.    Mr. Salmon. Sure. I think Mr. Chabot has an opening statement.    Mr. Salmon. Yeah. He was talking about a brokered convention. I'm sorry.officials wasn't allowed to meet here in Washington, DC. That is outrageous. It is an insult to Taiwan and the United States should change this immediately.    I also urge the administration to have direct dialogue with the democratically-elected President of Taiwan and, as you all know, international diplomacy face-to-face meetings are an important component in ensuring a sustainable relationship.    And finally, I would like to note that I introduced H. Con. Res. 88 last fall. This legislation reaffirms that Taiwan Relations Act and the six assurances together form the cornerstone of U.S. relations with Taiwan. I would urge my colleagues to join in that support.    I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Salmon. Thank you. Mr. Connolly.    Mr. Salmon. Thank you.    Ms. Meng.    Mr. Salmon. Mr. Bera, if you would like to make a quick opening statement. You good?    Mr. Lowenthal, did you want to make a quick statement?    Mr. Salmon. Thank you very much.    We are going to go ahead and introduce our first panelist. Thank you so much for being here today, Ms. Thornton.    We are pleased to have Ms. Susan Thornton here today, deputy assistant secretary of state in the State Department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. And we would like to have you give your opening statement and have some questions and then we will excuse you and we will seat the next panel.    You understand the lighting system. Not real complicated. When it goes amber you got a minute and when it goes red, most of the time people keep talking around here, but you should stop.    Thank you. Ms. Thornton.    Mr. Salmon. Thank you, Ms. Thornton.    Regarding the recent earthquake, what kind of assistance are we planning to offer them as they look to find missing people or rebuild?    Mr. Salmon. Thank you.    In your opening statement at the close, you were reaffirming our commitment to the one-China policy as spelled out in the three communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act and I really appreciate that. I think that is valuable.    Let me just quote--right after Secretary of State John Kerry had his first meeting with his Chinese counterpart, the Foreign Minister, after the elections he said this to reporters:        ``Let me just say with respect to one of the issues         that the Foreign Minister raised on Taiwan that since         they just had an election and a new party has won, the         United States does reaffirm the three communiques,         which have been the basis of our policy, we remain         committed to a one-China policy but we encourage cross-        Strait dialogue for resolution of that issue.''    Now, in his comments he didn't mention the Taiwan Relations Act, that our one-China policy is not just based on the three communiques but also the Taiwan Relations Act.    As you aptly pointed out, the Taiwan Relations Act states that it is U.S. policy to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and a grave concern to the United States.    How significant, if at all, do you consider the omission to have been and what if any are the implications?    Mr. Salmon. And we wanted to give you the opportunity to make sure that that was part of the package, that that is a strong commitment and that is a strong part of our policy.    After President Tsai got elected, she said that maintaining the status quo is her commitment to the people of Taiwan regarding the cross-Strait relations and the international community and there won't be provocation and there won't be surprises.    Meanwhile, directly after the election, China broadcast images of archived live-fired military drills. How confident are you, if at all, that the DPP and the Chinese leadership have workable communication channels that might help them avoid misunderstandings and manage the tensions?    Mr. Salmon. Thank you.    Mr. Sherman.    Mr. Salmon. Mr. Royce--Chairman Royce.    Mr. Salmon. Thank you.    Mr. Connolly.    Mr. Salmon. Mr. Chabot.    Mr. Salmon. Thank you, Ms. Meng.    That will conclude the first panel.    We will have the second panel be seated. I just also wanted to say that we are trying to reschedule the classified briefing because we are going to have votes called in about 15 minutes.    We might just get through the testimony of the second panel when we get called for votes. But thank you so much, Ms. Thornton, for coming and thank you for all your attention. So we'll seat the next panel now.    I think we'll go ahead and move on with introductions. I know we're kind of clearing the room out but we want to make sure we get your testimony before we have to go vote.    We are really pleased to be joined today by three excellent panelists. First, Mr. Randall Schriver, president and CEO of the Project 2049 Institute; Ms. Bonnie Glaser, good to see you again, senior advisor for Asia and director of the China Power Project and Center for Strategic and International Studies; and Dr. Shelley Rigger, Davidson University's political science department.    We are really grateful for these witnesses joining us today to lend their expertise and we'll start with you, Mr. Schriver.    Mr. Salmon. Thank you.    Ms. Glaser.    Mr. Salmon. Dr. Rigger.    Mr. Salmon. Thank you.    When I first came to Congress in the '90s, Warren Christopher was the Secretary of State and I remember him coming before one of our committees and testifying that our policy with China and Taiwan was one of strategic ambiguity.    I thought that was the stupidest thing I'd ever heard in my life, and my understanding is that's still our policy. Is it or isn't it? Dr. Rigger, do you want to take a stab at that?    Mr. Salmon. But what it's yielded is really idiotic policies like when Lee Teng-hui couldn't visit his alma mater at Cornell and we had to pass special legislation encouraging or allowing him to do so.    Or Taiwan virtually being kicked out of every international body and now we have to try to assert in the name of common sense that they be allowed to participate in bodies like Interpol when we're all--we want all hands on deck to fight international terrorism and international crime and trafficking--in human trafficking.    It just makes sense to have all hands on deck. And why in the world would anybody in Taiwan ever want to follow up on China's offer of peaceful reunification with a one-China two systems when they see how they hoodwink the people of Hong Kong?    Universal suffrage--you know, the folks in Hong Kong believe that claptrap that Beijing was throwing at them that, you know, it's going to be one-China, two systems when in reality the leader of Hong Kong gets picked by Beijing. Why would Taiwan ever want to yield to that?    Ms. Glaser, do you have any thoughts?    Mr. Salmon. Oh, and in Taiwan proselytizing is legal. People can share their religious views freely. They have freedom of the press.    You have peaceful transitions from one, you know, party to the next in leadership and the President's office and in the seat of government, and they see the vast differences when you speak about your--with conviction.    I guess you can believe in something as long as you don't really believe it in China and that's--you know, that's the problem. If you really believe in something then you're a fanatic and you get imprisoned.    And so, you know, the people of Taiwan watch this stuff happening and they're very cautious. Look, I was as concerned as anybody with some of the statements that Chen Shui-bian was making, you know, later on in his administration.    But Tsai Ing-wen has said that she intends to promote the status quo. She's not trying to upset the apple cart but she's made it clear that her first interest and first duty is to the people of Taiwan, not to the people on mainland China. I don't think that's all that extreme. I think that's just common sense.    And so as they go forward, how can we monitor, you know, in our relations with the cross-Strait? What indicators should we be monitoring for a sense of how the cross-Strait relationship is being handled between China and the DPP, whether or not they're going to stonewall her like they did Chen Shui-bian?    I guess that's one thing we could probably see pretty readily. But the other one is what do you expect will happen to current formal official contact between the two sides of the Strait? Do you think there's going to be any degradation of that?    Mr. Salmon. I'm just going to close with this and then yield to Mr. Sherman. But, you know, a position of strategic ambiguity would be when a Member of Congress asks the panelist, you know, how do you feel about Taiwan participation in the second round of the TPP and the answer coming back, we welcome their interest in that, that's a position of strategic ambiguity out there in the ozone.    A strategic clarity statement would be yes, we welcome their involvement, their participation--not their interest. But we--like you said, Mr. Schriver, would you agree with that?    Mr. Salmon. Yes, let's just stop parsing words and say what we mean.    Mr. Sherman.    Mr. Salmon. He doesn't talk to me either.    Mr. Salmon. I thank the panel. This has been very, very, very helpful. Thank you very much.    One just last question. You had mentioned that there were four things and I think we got three. Would the fourth be Tibet?    I mean, are they still--because every time I ever met with senior Beijing officials the two things that, you know, was like drilling on their teeth without novocaine was Taiwan Strait and Tibet. Is that still pretty much the same thing.    Mr. Salmon. Right. Right.    Well, thank you very much. I really appreciate the panel and thank the ranking member. It's been very edifying and I want to congratulate the people of Taiwan again on a wonderfully successful and peaceful election and transition that's about to happen and also let them know that we're with you in spirit and in every other way in relationship to rebuilding after the earthquake.    So thank you very much.    Mr. Salmon. This committee is adjourned.
