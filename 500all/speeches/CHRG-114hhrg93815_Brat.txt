    Mr. Brat. Thank you, to all that are with us today, for your testimony.    I taught economic justice for the last 18 years at Randolph-Macon College and so I think it is the intent of everyone here, and the--sometimes the partisan hyperbole goes a little overboard, but I think everyone here is in favor of justice for everybody and equal treatment under the law for everybody. And so I applaud all of you for your statements. I think it just comes down to kind of common sense and where the pendulum is.    And so I think you have all done an outstanding job today, of showing us that it looks like the--previous comments just offered up--the EEOC is overreaching in some cases, or the employer is the better judge of what should be taking place. And at the same time, we don't--our justice system allows for individuals under law to contest that.    And so I don't have much more to add beyond what our panelists today have offered up.    Thank you very much for being with us.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman--my time back to the Chairman, yes.
