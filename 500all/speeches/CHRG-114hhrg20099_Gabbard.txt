    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Biswal, in your opening remarks you mentioned the Maldivia, and I know you ran out of time, so I would like to ask you to speak a little bit more about the Maldives, and specifically, the percentage of their small population who are foreign fighters who are traveling to Syria.    Can you talk about how the United States is working with the Maldives to counter this strikingly high number of foreign fighters that they have from the Maldives?    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you. Shifting over to Bangladesh, Mr. Stivers, you remembered thoughtfully, the USAID worker and human rights activist who was slaughtered most recently. On Sunday, the New York Times editorial board wrote about how Bangladesh has descended into lawlessness. I introduced a resolution last year calling on the Government of Bangladesh to protect the rights of religious minorities in the country, including Christians, secularists, atheists, Hindus, Buddhists, et cetera.    Can you speak to what is your sense of the situation, and the government's response? What more should they be doing than they are already specifically?    Mr. Gabbard. Thank you, Ms. Biswal. I am over my time, but in closing, in all of your remarks, you talked about the tools that the U.S. is trying to provide to support the Bangladesh Government, but you didn't talk about the leadership and the resolve that must begin and come from the Government of Bangladesh if there is to be any progress. There are tools, and then there is leadership and commitment to standing against these acts of terrorism and extreme violence, and a commitment to hold those perpetrators accountable. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
