    Mr. McKinley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I had probably 5 minutes of questioning. We are going to try to cut it back down to three. The first observation I had about this whole issue--I was really looking forward to be educated about this, and I think some of you have touched on it. But the primary issue is about rural America. I think we struggle. Coming from West Virginia in a small community is how do we have an educated workforce, ready for manufacturing, energy, when we don't have a critical mass? So I am applauding--what we did last year in the last Congress, we introduced a bill. It was 3524 that tried to focus funds going into economically deprived communities to help out, to plus them up some in the grants and programs for education. I think we ought to be looking at that as well. I don't know whether any of you are familiar with that bill that was introduced last year, but I know that Tracy, you got something going at Penn College that is also at Pierpont where we have a training program there for Shale NET.    Mr. McKinley. Can you explain some of the advantages of how that has helped out? Because there at Fairmont is a small community that is struggling. So this program may be helpful. Can you share a little bit about some of the advantages and how we might be able to spread that broader for other rural communities?    Mr. McKinley. Well, as much as how we just need to keep going, are you familiar at all with the bill that was providing grants for economically depressed areas? Were you familiar with that last year?    Mr. McKinley. I would like to get your feedback from that, from an academic standpoint or so, how that might work. It was 3524 during the last Congress. And see whether or not there are some advantages of us being able to focus on economically deprived areas, particularly those in rural America. Thank you very much.
