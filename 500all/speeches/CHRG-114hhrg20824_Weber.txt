    Mr. Weber. Thank you, Madam Chair. And let the record show I have five minutes and second seconds.    Thank you for the opportunity to be here and participate.    And, Dr. Dickman, this question is for you. The past--this past year public researchers involved in communicating the science of biotechnology and its impacts have been--actually been targeted both professionally and personally. I'm sure you're aware that. Doctor, as a public scientist, can you give me more background kind of into the current academic feeling on this public outreach? You all are getting targeted a lot of--some stuff has been aimed at you. What's the feeling amongst your peers?    Mr. Weber. Not too bad? You actually said I believe in your discussion with the Chairwoman that you felt like you all needed to do a better job of showing capabilities, I guess educating the public?    Mr. Weber. Has that been progressing?    Mr. Weber. Have you done the genomic sequencing on that grass? You said grassroots level.    Mr. Weber. All right. So you're doing it at the basic level is what you're saying.    Mr. Weber. There is a shock, huh? Well, we'll thank you for that.    And, Dr. Evans, as you know, Dow Chemical has a lot of industry in my district there in Texas. In fact, I was going to tell the gentleman from Illinois--he left before I could--that there was 78,000 jobs associated with this. In Texas, there's 81,000 jobs. Things are bigger in Texas.    So--but, Dr. Evans, you also mentioned in the three C's of national needs both continuing to support national scientific funding agencies and convening forms of discussion for the public engagement or outreach that Dr. Dickman and I were just discussing. With limited resources in public research, what role do companies, for example, like Dow Chemical play in promoting that scientific interest?    Mr. Weber. That's a good point, you know, in your discussion with the gentleman from New York, Representative Tonko, I think you said, just because we can do something, you should ask the question should we do something. And if the public perceives that a company is getting involved, is that a conflict of interest? I think you were the one who said--let me quote you. Earlier, you said that we needed more feed, fuel, fiber, and food, more--and by 2050 than in the last 10,000 years. That's an astounding fact. And with limited resources available I think if the public knew, you know, what was at stake here, that they might not be so suspicious. But I appreciate your testimony and, Madam Chair, your indulgence. And I yield back.    Chairwoman Comstock. Thank you. And I think by agreement Mr. Westerman has a few more questions, and I'm going to let him have the chair because I'm going to have to depart. But I want to thank the witnesses very much for a very interesting and insightful hearing and appreciate all the great research you're doing. And I'm glad we have two women here, too. So thank you. And we certainly appreciate the men, but thank you for your comments, Dr. Shetty, and we will keep those in mind going forward, too. Thank you.
