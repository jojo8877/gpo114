    Mr. Lance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Commissioner Pai, I want to speak with you about the FCC's recent order regarding TCPA. You stated in your dissent that the attempt to modernize it, ``is likely to leave the American consumer, not to mention American enterprise, worse off''. Can you elaborate to the Committee how you believe the Commission may not have gotten this correct, and what it should have done to protect the American consumer?    Mr. Lance. Why do you think the Commission did not have a safe harbor rule?    Mr. Lance. Thank you. Chairman?    Mr. Lance. Thank you. Any sur-rebuttal, Commissioner Pai?    Mr. Lance. Thank you. My time has expired, and thank you for the rebuttal, the sur-rebuttal, the sur-sur-rebuttal, and the sur-sur-sur-rebuttal.    Mr. Lance. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
