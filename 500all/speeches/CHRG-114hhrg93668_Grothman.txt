    Mr. Grothman. Thank you very much.    Mr. Grothman. OK. Very good. I have got a couple of questions for you folks. First of all, thanks for spending so much time with us today. I really appreciate you doing that.    Obviously, there is a lot of discussion about who the new Director is going to be. There is a feeling that he ought to come from outside the agency now. I just want your opinions. Why do you believe the next Director should come from outside the agency?    Mr. Grothman. That is kind of illuminating, because usually when you deal in government people like--you know, they are afraid of somebody from the outside. But it says a lot for you guys. You guys would not--you feel that somebody other than Acting Director Clancy, kind of that outside view, would be an improvement?    Mr. Grothman. OK. One other question, because we are running out of time here. Right now you guys fly in agents to supplement the uniformed division at the White House. And apparently that is very expensive. Could you comment on that practice?    Mr. Grothman. OK. So you feel we are spending money unnecessarily by doing things this way?    Mr. Grothman. OK. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman.
