    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to the panel for being here. Reading information in preparation for this hearing and seeing the fact that we have the lowest number of banks in the United States, since records being kept to 1934, is a concern. I mean, the reason why this country, as I recollect, is the greatest country in the world based upon only a short period of time of being alive as a country, 240 years, is because we had the ability to take risk and develop reward to get capital into the marketplace, into the hands of people who can generate opportunity for people.    So to hear concerns fostered in the last 8 years about trying to protect us against what has really made us great and oversee in such a way that we hold back the genius of what compounded interest, capital being freely and relatively easy to gain if you have the process in place that says will you take that risk on me is a concern.    Mr. Browning, your testimony says that constantly evolving and ambiguous requirements at the FDIC are putting up roadblocks to new entrance. Could you expand and describe the situation in a little more detail?    Mr. Walberg. And yet you are not a novice in the field?    Mr. Walberg. Which is not the reason why you're getting into that line of work. You need to develop the risk as you determine as best to meet your agenda, which is, I would assume, to succeed and succeed for the people that use your resources.    Mr. Williams, in your written testimony you mention that regulations are more detrimental to a bank's profitability than low interest rates. Why is that?    Mr. Walberg. It takes the natural rhythm that would be in place in those types of dealings and puts it on its ear, doesn't it?    Mr. Walberg. And you truly believe that if all of this was in place when you started back in 1990, that you probably wouldn't have started up the bank?    Mr. Walberg. Thanks for your service. I yield back.
