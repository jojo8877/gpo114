    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Linick, let me just begin with you. Did your office, the Office of the Inspector General, make recommendations to OBO to not begin the construction until they were sure that the building would survive a blast?    Mr. Hice. Okay. So is that--it would be a ``yes'' then?    Mr. Hice. Which included that it could survive a blast.    Mr. Hice. That's the whole purpose.    Mr. Hice. All right. And with the DS--and let me go a little bit further with what you were just saying--did your recommendation to DS include that they have controls in place to make sure that any building is fully vetted so that it is adequate for security purposes?    Mr. Hice. Okay.    Mr. Hice. All right. In your recommendations, from your perspective, from the office--OIG's office--would a letter from an architectural firm be adequate, or did you want more than just a letter?    Mr. Hice. So you're saying that the blast testing was required.    Mr. Hice. Then all failed. And we've heard today from Mr. Starr that in his opinion blast testing was not required, but in your opinion that's the only way to adequately ensure that it was equipped to endure a potential blast.    Mr. Hice. Otherwise, all you have is a letter.    All right, so, in your opinion, the recommendations that came from your office were not fulfilled. Is that true?    Mr. Hice. So the recommendations are still outstanding?    Mr. Hice. All right. In your words, did you receive pushback from OBO or DS on the recommendations?    Mr. Hice. Although that has not yet taken place.    Mr. Hice. Is there any reason, any valid reason that you can think of as to why OBO and DS would not comply, would refuse, deny to implement your recommendations initially?    Mr. Hice. Right, but is there any valid reason you can think of why they would not proceed with fulfilling your recommendations?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Is there anything legislatively that can be done that would help?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Thank you.    And thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
