    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I applaud EPA's efforts to finalize the Clean Power Plan, which is an historic and important step in our ongoing battle against the threat of unchecked climate change.    According to NOAA, 2014 was the warmest year ever recorded, and 9 of the 10 hottest years have occurred since 2000. In fact, this past summer was the hottest on record, and 2015 is well on its way to surpassing last year's record. Every corner of the earth is going to be affected.    Representing a coastal area that saw firsthand the damage done by Superstorm Sandy, I'm particular concerned about extreme weather events and sea level rise. We're already experiencing warmer and more frequent hot days, more frequent and heavier rainstorms, drier and longer droughts, and more extreme high sea levels. In the past week, North and South Carolina saw unprecedented levels of rain, 16 people have died, and early reports estimate billions of dollars in damage. And, sadly, extreme weather like this has become the new norm.    As President Obama recently said and I quote, ``Climate change is no longer some far off problem. It's happening here, it's happening now. We cannot wait for some future generation to take action.'' To that end, EPA finalized a workable plan to reduce carbon emissions from power plants which are the largest uncontrolled source of manmade greenhouse gases in the U.S.    Overall, EPA engaged in an unprecedented level of outreach and public engagement on the Clean Power Plan. The final rule reflects extensive stakeholder input, including over 4.3 million public comments, a series of listening sessions held across the country, and scores of meetings with stakeholders across the spectrum.    As a result of the comments received on the proposal, EPA made a number of changes to the final Clean Power Plan to insure flexibility, affordability, reliability, and investment in clean energy technologies. And the Clean Power Plan is not a one-size-fits-all proposal for reducing emissions. It uses a flexible State-based approach that takes account of each individual State's unique capacity to reduce emissions from its electricity sector. And in the final rule, EPA made changes to the plan's building blocks to provide more flexibility for States when determining the best way to achieve their individual goals, while still providing compliance options and ample opportunity for the use of energy efficiency to reduce carbon pollution from power plants.    Now, EPA is not proposing the States act overnight. States have until 2030 to meet their final goals, and the plan's interim goals don't begin until 2022. Further, the final rule provides additional flexibility for States to determine their own individual compliance pathway. And EPA is encouraging States to make early emission reductions by creating a Clean Energy Incentive Program that will reward early investments in wind and solar generation, as well as demand-side energy efficiency programs implemented in low-income communities.    Ultimately, the Clean Power Plan represents a serious commitment to climate action, and will result in climate benefits of $20 billion, and health benefits of $14-34 billion. Increased levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are threatening the health and well-being of all Americans, and this plan will protect public health by avoiding 3,600 premature deaths, 1,700 heart attacks, and 90,000 asthma attacks each year.    Let's not heed the absurd arguments on behalf of companies that profit from the status quo. We've already heard from some that EPA's plan is not legal, that it's unworkable, and that some States may refuse to participate, but as I've said before, those making such arguments aren't really interested in finding solutions to our carbon pollution problem. They're not interested in developing a plan to help us reduce emissions while still maintaining a safe, reasonably priced electricity system.    They're more than welcome to ignore the facts and reject any reasonable plan to address climate change, but let me tell you, history will not treat them kindly. History is on the side of those who want to act on climate change, those who believe in the power of American innovation, and our ability to successfully meet any challenge, and to look to the future rather than the past.    Frankly, we've already wasted enough time on legislation to just say no to climate action, and now Congress must move on. What we cannot do, as President Obama said, and I'll close, and I quote. He said is, ``We cannot condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair.''    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.

And thank you, Ms. McCABE, for your testimony.    The Clean Power Plan is an important step in reducing emissions from power plants, the Nation's largest source of carbon pollution. And today we've heard about the actions that EPA has taken to create strong, fair, and flexible standards that will put us on the path to a clean energy future and help avoid the worst impacts of climate change.    However, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence and broad public support we continue to hear a litany of arguments from the GOP for why we shouldn't act, you know, climate change is a hoax. They say carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, EPA is a rogue agency with no authority to limit carbon pollution.    I'd like to give you an opportunity to respond to a few of these assertions. And first, you know, yes or no, is carbon dioxide a pollutant?    Mr. Pallone. Can you briefly explain why EPA has the authority to address carbon pollution from power plants?    Mr. Pallone. All right. Is there any way we can reduce our emissions by enough to avoid the worst impacts of climate change without controlling carbon pollution from power plants?    Mr. Pallone. I've also heard from my Republican colleagues that they say that no one goes to the hospital for breathing in carbon pollution so there can't be any real public health benefits from limiting carbon pollution from power plants. Could you explain how the Clean Power Plan will help protect public health and welfare?    Mr. Pallone. I know that in our previous hearings you've discussed the unprecedented outreach efforts undertaken by EPA to inform the development, to inform the public about the proposed rule. So, I just wanted to hear a little bit now about outreach on the final rule. Could you please briefly comment on EPA's outreach to both the interested stakeholders and the public, and how this engagement has been reflected in the final rule?    Mr. Pallone. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
