    Mr. McNerney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    It sounds like the whole purpose really is to get veterans into work and to get them into businesses. Does the VR&E program give help or assistance to service-connected disabled veterans in starting their own businesses? Whoever would care to answer.    Mr. McNerney. Okay. Well, if you have any suggestions on how to move forward on that, we would love to hear that, and we can see if we can get that into action.    What is the connection, or the overlap between the VR&E programs and the GI Bill? Whoever would care to answer that. Mr. Varela, would you care to answer that?    Mr. McNerney. Right.    Mr. McNerney. So can you participate in both the GI Bill and the VR&E programs?    Mr. McNerney. Thank you.    Mr. Meglathery, you mentioned the need for a holistic approach with partners. Could you elaborate on that a little bit, please?    Mr. McNerney. Are there guidelines or incentives that this committee could supply to the business community?    Mr. McNerney. You mentioned, Ms. Ansley, that you could use another 318, I think, new counselors. I forget the exact number, but----    Mr. McNerney. Oh, 382.    Mr. McNerney. Okay. I got the 8 right, but I was in the wrong tens.    Mr. McNerney. So how does that work? I mean, you would get those funded through the VA, the VA would fund Paralyzed Veterans of America to hire those?    Mr. McNerney. All right.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I now yield back.    Mr. McNerney. Thank you. I have a couple of questions for Mr. Meglathery. You mentioned, and one of the other panelists mentioned, the one-year monitor of employment is insufficient. What is the current practice? I mean, not that they are insufficient, but they need a one-year monitoring program. What is the current practice?    Mr. McNerney. 60 days. So they are watched and see if they are employed for 60 days, and if they lose the job within 60 days, they go back into the program; is that correct?    Mr. McNerney. I mean, is that just a statistic, or do they use that 60-day failure to try and reenter the veteran into a program?    Mr. McNerney. So it needs to be more than just the statistic anyway?    Mr. McNerney. Okay. The other thing is, you mentioned, Mr. Meglathery, that veterans with mental disabilities have more--have worse employment outcomes. Could you go into that a little bit for me?    Mr. McNerney. Is there additional service needed, or help needed, for folks with post-traumatic stress or other mental disabilities as a result of combat that would be useful in job training that isn't available now?    Mr. McNerney. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
