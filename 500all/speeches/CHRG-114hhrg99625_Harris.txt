    Admiral Harris. Thank you, Chairman Thornberry and Representative Davis and distinguished members. It is an honor for me to appear before this committee. I am pleased to be here with General Scaparrotti to discuss how U.S. Pacific Command is protecting America's interests across the vast Indo-Asia-Pacific.    Since taking command of PACOM last May, I have had the extraordinary privilege of leading the 400,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, Coast Guardsmen, and civilians serving our Nation. These dedicated men and women and their families are doing an amazing job, and I am proud to serve alongside them.    To provide you some issues of concern, I would like to briefly highlight a few regional issues. As China continues its pattern of destabilizing militarization of the South China Sea, we have resumed our freedom of navigation operations there, a waterway vital to America's prosperity, where $5.3 trillion in trade traverses each year.    General Scaparrotti and I remain aligned in dealing with North Korea's recent underground nuclear test, followed by its ballistic missile launch.    A revanchist Russia is revitalizing its ability to execute long-range strategic patrols in the Pacific to include the basing of its newest strategic ballistic missile submarine and last month's bomber flights around Japan.    Recent terrorist attacks in Bangladesh and Indonesia underscore the fact that violent Islamic extremism is a global concern that must be crushed.    We have continued to strengthen our alliances and partnerships. Japan's peace and security legislation authorizing limited collective self-defense will take effect this year. This legislation and the revised guidelines for U.S.-Japan defense cooperation will significantly increase Japan's ability to work with us.    Thanks to the great leadership of General Scaparrotti here, South Korea and the United States have taken a strong and unified stance to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. In the face of recent North Korean aggression, PACOM hosted a tri-CHOD meeting between U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Dunford; Japan Chairman, Admiral Kawano; and South Korea Chairman, General Lee. Trilateral cooperation between Japan, South Korea, and the United States is a priority, and I am doing everything I can to enhance it.    Our alliance with the Philippines took an important step forward when the Philippine Supreme Court recently upheld the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, or EDCA, which will provide significant partnership and access benefits.    I am also excited about our growing relationship with India, where I will visit next week. As the world's two largest democracies, we are uniquely poised to help bring greater security and prosperity to the entire region.    Two visionary policies are now coinciding as the United States rebalances west to the Indo-Asia-Pacific and India implements its ``Act East'' policy. Last month's Malabar exercise between India, Japan, and the United States shows the security interconnectedness of the Indian Ocean, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean.    I rely heavily on Australia, not only for its advanced military capabilities across all domains but, importantly, for Australia's warfighting experience and leadership in operations around the world.    These examples clearly demonstrate to me that the United States is a security partner of choice in the Indo-Asia-Pacific. It is also why I believe that our strategic rebalance has taken hold. Given that four of the five strategic problem sets identified by Secretary Carter--China, North Korea, Russia, and ISIL --are in our region, I would say that we can't rebalance fast enough. But there is more work to do, and we must not lose the momentum.    So I ask this committee to support continued investment in future capabilities. I need weapons systems of increased lethality that go faster, go further, and are more survivable. If funding uncertainties continue, the U.S. will experience reduced warfighting capabilities, so I urge the Congress to repeal sequestration.    Finally, I would like to thank this committee and the whole Congress for your enduring support to PACOM and to the men and women in uniform, our civilian teammates, and our families.    Thank you. And I look forward to your questions.    The Chairman. Thank you, sir.    General.    General Scaparrotti. Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Davis, and distinguished members of the committee, I am honored to testify today as the Commander of the United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command, and the United States Forces-Korea . On behalf of the American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, and our civilians serving in the Republic of Korea, thank you for your support.    Admiral Harris, thank you for your vision and the professional support of the entire PACOM team for USFK.    I have prepared brief opening remarks, and I appreciate that my written posture statement is being entered into the record.    Since my last testimony, our U.S.-ROK alliance has continued to focus on advancing our combined capabilities. Some of these advanced capabilities include the establishment of the first U.S.-ROK combined division, additional rotations of U.S. forces to the peninsula, the execution of our annual combined training exercises, and steady progress on our $10.7 billion plan to relocate U.S. forces in Korea. Furthermore, the Republic of Korea has improved its capabilities with the recent establishment of the Korean Air and Missile Defense System and Center and the Allied Korea Joint Command and Control System.    The Republic of Korea has also invested in modern equipment, with the purchase of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Global Hawk, the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile upgrades, and also AH-64 Apache helicopters. These alliance advances help counter the real and the proximate North Korean threat.    North Korea continues to conduct provocations and to resource its large conventional force. And, of greater significance, North Korea continues to aggressively develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in direct violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions, as demonstrated with its fourth nuclear test and its fifth TD-2 launch in January and February.    In regards to this threat, my top concern remains the potential for a North Korean provocation to start a cycle of action and counteraction which could quickly escalate, similar to what we experienced this past August. While I am proud to report that our alliance stood shoulder to shoulder and deescalated the situation, it could have spiraled out of control and demonstrates why we must remain ready to ``fight tonight.''    To maintain this level of readiness, we will continue to focus on sustaining, strengthening, and transforming the alliance, with an emphasis on our combined readiness in four critical areas. First, ISR remains my top readiness challenge. CFC USFK requires additional persistent all-weather ISR capabilities, as well as dependable moving target indicator support to maintain situational awareness and provide adequate decision space.    Second, it is critical for the alliance to establish a layered and interoperable ballistic missile defense. To advance this goal in the near future, we will begin bilateral consultations regarding the feasibility of deploying the THAAD system to the Republic of Korea, which would complement the Patriot system's capabilities.    Third, we must maintain an adequate quantity of critical munitions to ensure alliance supremacy in the early days of conflict on the peninsula. This requirement is further amplified by the approaching loss of cluster munitions due to shelf-life expiration and the impending ban.    And, fourth, we must focus on command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence, or C4I. Both the United States and the Republic of Korea are investing in new tactical equipment that will comprise a reliable C4I architecture, but more is required.    In closing, I would like to express how proud I am of our service members, our civilians, and their families serving in the Republic of Korea, who never lose sight of the fact that they are serving on freedom's frontier.    I would also like to recognize Ambassador Mark Lippert, Admiral Harry Harris, and the U.S. and ROK senior leaders for their enduring commitment to our mission.    I thank you and this committee for your support, and I look forward to your questions.    The Chairman. Thank you, sir.    Let me ask you each to address really a very basic question, and that is, do you have the military forces required to fulfill the missions you have been assigned?    And, Admiral Harris, you mentioned the freedom of navigation operations, which have been underway. From what one reads, they are pretty few and far between and don't seem to be making much of a difference, because we also read that the Chinese have put surface-to-air missiles on these new islands they are constructing. So if you could address, broadly, in your theater, do you have the military forces to carry out the missions you are assigned, and then, more specifically, the Chinese South China Sea issues that have arisen.    Admiral Harris. Yes, sir. Happy to do that.    With regard to the first issue of do I have the forces necessary to conduct our missions, today, I feel I do. I think we are set up well in NDAA 2016. Thanks to the Congress for that. And in the budget submission for fiscal year 2017, it meets the concerns that I had in the past, the fiscal year 2017 budget addresses those concerns. So I am comfortable with where we are today, but today we are not at war, and I think that is an important point.    There are concerns that I have, clearly. As General Scaparrotti mentioned, there are concerns about munitions. My submarine numbers--and I mentioned this yesterday during my testimony--I don't have the submarines that I feel I need, but that is a function of the total number of submarines that the United States Navy has and the global demand for that platform.    More persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft and systems, ISR, is a requirement, I think, as well as cyber and getting after cyber.    I have testified in the past and have spoken in the past about the need for a long-range anti-surface missile, a missile that can out-stick, if you will, Chinese missile systems in the Pacific and so on. And I am pleased that in the fiscal year 2017 budget, you know, there are funds put against development of LRASM, the long-range anti-surface missile. Secretary Work recently spoke about the work that has been done to improve the SM-6 missile and give it an anti-surface and anti-ship capability, which I think is dramatic, and that is exactly what I need in the Pacific.    With regard to your question about China's actions, in my opinion, China's intent to militarize the South China Sea is as certain as a traffic jam in DC. It is no doubt in my mind what their intent is. Their SSMs, their surface--their SAMs , rather, their missiles on Woody Island, their 10,000-foot runways that they are building in Subi Reef and Fiery Cross Reef and elsewhere, their advanced radars that we saw pictures of the last couple days at Cuarteron Reef, these are all indications of militarization. And, in my mind, they are changing the operational landscape of the South China Sea.    The Chairman. And if you could address, sir, the freedom of navigation operations. Do you have enough ships, and what kind of ships would you say are most effective for those sorts of operations?    Admiral Harris. Sure. So, on the freedom of navigation operations, clearly, have enough ships to do that. The 7th Fleet out there, homeported principally in Japan, has the ships, the requisite ships to do freedom of navigation operations.    The best kind of ship, in my opinion, to do that is the DDG-51-class, Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, highly capable, the right kind of weapons and the right kind of systems to ensure that freedom of navigation operations are conducted well and the ship is well able to defend itself should those operations go awry.    Regarding the frequency of freedom of navigation operations and their effect on China's militarization in the South China Sea, freedom of navigation operations, the military part of that, the freedom of navigation operation itself is only a part of the broader policy approach to what China's doing. So I think my part of that, the execution of the operation itself, is one piece of it, and I think we are doing that, as I said, and we will be doing more of it, as I have spoken before in other venues. We will be doing them more, and we will be doing them with greater complexity in the future. And as the Secretary said, we will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows. And then there is a policy piece to it and a diplomatic piece and a political piece to it, and that is for the whole-of-government effort on moving China and their position in the South China Sea.    The Chairman. General, do you have the forces you need to carry out the mission to which you have been assigned?    General Scaparrotti. Chairman, thank you for the question. I would say that, first of all, for the forces on the peninsula, I enjoy being financed or budgeted at the very top of the priority list, so the forces are getting the funding to do the exercises, the training, and assets that they need on the peninsula to be ready to fight tonight, and I appreciate the support of this committee in ensuring that we do have that resourcing.    As I noted in my opening comments, there are areas of concern. First is ISR. On the Korean Peninsula, we are facing a foe that is a million strong, and it is literally 35 miles from the capital and the--you know, half of their population, the Korean population, 35 miles away with an adversary that uses a cycle of provocation. So, typically, I think I have about 12 hours or less warning, and persistent ISRs allows me to have that indication and warning and to set my posture to first defend South Korea and the large American citizen population that we have there as well. So ISR is something that is at the top of my list.    I mentioned ballistic missile defense. You are well aware of the large arsenal that North Korea has in ballistic missiles that are--that is growing in strength but also in accuracy. I think that the discussions we are having right now to add THAAD to Korea are very important. We need THAAD there to have a layered defense. I need more munitions so that I have the first 30 days of munitions for the fight in terms of interceptors, and I rely on the quick deployment of at least two more battalions of Patriot as well if we go to crisis. So, you know, the assets of BMD there, the more that I have there, the better protected we are.    And I think those are the primary of those four that I would mention shortly here, and I can go into more detail later.    The Chairman. Thank you.    Mrs. Davis.    Admiral Harris. Well, I think, ma'am, that, short of military confrontation, which we all want to avoid, I think the way forward, the best way to go forward is to present and maintain our credible military power and to maintain our network of like-minded allies, partners, and friends in the region and encourage them to operate in the South China Sea. And we must continue to operate in the South China Sea to demonstrate that that water space--and the air above it--is international and not the territory of any nation.    I think the diplomacy, obviously, is probably the most important thing. We need to encourage China to act as a responsible actor on the international space when it comes to things like the South China Sea. Secretary Kerry recently said at Sunnylands that we have only one policy with regard to the South China Sea, and that is a negotiated settlement, that is to negotiate and work with China, and that is kind of where I am on that.    Admiral Harris. Thanks, sir, for those questions. I will just start by talking about General Stilwell for just a second. There is an article in today's clips about how the Chinese are honoring General Stilwell in Chongqing in China at a museum that is run by the government there, and the relationship that he formed and his feelings for the Chinese. So I think that is an appropriate way to start this off. Thank you for that.    Admiral Harris. With regard to the fiscal year 2017 request, it has, I think, a good mix in it of funding for what we need today and funding for technological innovations, such as the third offset. Recently, Secretary Work talked about the SCO office, the Special Capabilities Office, and the work that they are doing. And this is important stuff as we seek to not only modernize our force but also to maintain the force we have.    And so, you know, as a combatant commander, I don't have the luxury of waiting 5 years for the next great thing that is going to come down the pike, because I have to be ready to fight tonight, and that is the stance that we take in the Pacific most--epitomized by General Scaparrotti and the challenge he has on the peninsula. So, you know, I can't say to you all: Hey, just give me a 5-year break here while we wait for the next technology thing to come down the road. So I need to have a modernized, capable military today, but I recognize as a uniformed officer that we have to modernize, and so that is the challenge, I think, for the service chiefs.    You know, I talked yesterday about how much easier it is to be an insatiable combatant commander than it is to be a service chief in 2016, but as a nation, we have an insatiable need for security, and rightfully so. And so, you know, it comes to the point, I guess, in the forward forces.    So I am pleased with how my input to the Secretary was upheld in the fiscal year 2017 budget, and I am pleased that that budget not only ensures that I have a modern, capable force to fight today but that the needs that I have identified, the shortfalls that we talked about in the last question, are being addressed.    Admiral Harris. Yes, sir. Good to see you.    Admiral Harris. On the CSIS study, I have read it, they had a number of interesting recommendations in there. I had a meeting with the CSIS leadership and spoke to them in my last trip to Washington.    On the idea of a maritime task force for the western Pacific, we have one, and it is called PACOM. And if there is some smaller entity of that, we have that also, and it is called the 7th Fleet. So I am very comfortable with the command and control structure and the forces as they are arrayed under PACOM. So there is a commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which is a JTF -certified, large combatant level staff headed up by a four-star that can carry out any operation that I need; the same with U.S. Army Pacific, General Brooks, four-star Army general, huge land forces under his command that can do that, if necessary. And then, in the far Pacific, in the Far East, you know, there is the U.S. 7th Fleet and all of its capability, there is the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force and all of its capability. So I think that we have in existence today the thing that CSIS recommended by another name. So I am comfortable with that, but I appreciate the insights that I got from their study.    Regarding partner capabilities, we could not do what we need to do alone, and we have great allies and partners in the region. I will start with Japan and its capability: a very powerful military, a tremendous maritime self-defense force, a great submarine force, a very capable land force, and a very strong air force in Japan. And on the other end of the globe down there is Australia, a partner and ally who has been with the United States, fought with us in virtually every conflict in the 20th century, and certainly into the 21st century. They are--they have a highly specialized, highly trained, very capable military that are completely aligned in terms of equipment and training and that with the United States. So, as I mentioned in my opening statement, I rely heavily on Australia, not only for their operational capability but for their warfighting experience and advice.    I think we will not see anything resembling NATO----    Admiral Harris . In the Pacific. It is--each country there is so different--and they face different levels of threat; they have different levels of relationships with other countries--that I don't think we will get this large, broad multilateral alliance like NATO. But the good news is we have strong alliances with five nations in the Pacific. We have strong partnerships with a whole lot more. And we are working hard, working strongly on improving trilateral cooperation between the U.S., Japan, and Korea; between the U.S., Japan, and Australia; and the U.S., Japan, and India.    Admiral Harris. Sure. Clearly, Congressman, because of the mobility associated with that and the fact that I can move the Patriots around with some degree of flexibility. So in the Pacific, Patriot is a key part of our ballistic missile defense, as is THAAD. So we have a THAAD battery in Guam that is there on a temporary basis now, expected to go to a permanent status, PCS status, if you will, later this year, and then, as General Scaparrotti mentioned, as we work with the Koreans to consult on putting THAAD in Korea as well. Then the other part of that, of course, is Aegis, so----    Admiral Harris. Well, that--so I talked about my desire to keep it as a permanent facility, because it has demonstrated a great capability. Now, it was built as a training facility and testing facility for the Aegis Ashore sites in Europe, but I think we should study it. I think we should take a hard look at it and whether we want to make it a permanent facility or not, but there is a lot between now and then.    Admiral Harris. This is just an idea now, but the Aegis Ashore in Hawaii, for example, has no interceptors, right. I mean, it--so----    Admiral Harris. So there is a lot there, but I think it is worthy of study, and that is kind of where we are now. So we are a long way from making a decision either way right now.    Admiral Harris. I will be honest with you, I am not familiar with that number, but we are getting new Baseline 9 destroyers in Japan now; we are setting out there in part of the overseas homeporting program. So, in the Pacific, I am comfortable with where we are with regard to that capability, and that is a tremendous capability. I mean, that ties together----    Admiral Harris . The E-2D and the Aegis system for this thing we call cooperative engagement.    Admiral Harris. So I am pleased with that.    Admiral Harris. Sir, I don't know that there is a benefit to it. You know, we have--Japan has Patriot batteries, and that is--they are very capable. We have the TPY-2 radar systems at Shariki and Kasumigaseki, and those are helpful. I think there is a study in place to look at whether an Aegis Ashore site has utility in Japan, but it is premature for me to make that statement now.    Admiral Harris. That could be, I mean, certainly.    Admiral Harris. I do, Congresswoman.    Admiral Harris. Yes, ma'am. I believe that Guam is a strategic bastion for the United States. The capabilities that are there and its location demand that we consider it a strategic bastion, and so, you know, we have put our fourth SSN there, nuclear submarine there, and we have brought in our second submarine tender there. So that is very exciting and I think the right level of emphasis on our submarine force in the western Pacific.    With regard to Futenma, I will defer to the Marine Corps on where they stand on the linkages between the Futenma Replacement Facility and the exodus of that group of marines from Okinawa to both Guam and Hawaii, but clearly the plan as conceived was, you know, we would move marines from Futenma to Camp Schwab-Henoko and then subsequently move a group of marines, 8,000 or so, from Okinawa to Hawaii and Guam, Guam and Hawaii in that order, but whether we are going to link that now or not, given that there is a delay in the movement of forces from Futenma to Schwab, I will have to defer to the Marine Corps on that.    Admiral Harris. It would only be affected perhaps in terms of timing, but the intent to move marines to Guam remains as strong as ever. That intent is there, and the resources we are putting into Guam and in the Commonwealth of Northern Marianas, that is proceeding apace.    Admiral Harris. Thanks, Congressman.    My priority, given the way you framed the question, is clearly submarines. Submarines are the original stealth platform. They clearly give us an asymmetric advantage. Our asymmetry in terms of warfare, because of submarines, is significant. And, you know, in the modernizing sense, we need to maintain that asymmetric advantage.    The second aircraft carrier, you know, I am a combatant commander, and I want more, and I want it now, right? The more I can get it, the faster I can get it, the happier I am.    Admiral Harris. But I think there are fiscal, diplomatic, and political hurdles--significant ones--to overcome before we would put a second carrier strike group in the western Pacific, you know, when you talk about an air wing, where would you put it, where would you train them, the 10,000 sailors, their families, the housing, the schools, the hospitals, the whole thing. But there are other things that we could do, in my opinion, that would improve our capability in the western Pacific and have an effect. We could consider putting another SSN submarine out there. We could put additional destroyers forward. We could put maybe the new destroyer, the DDG-1000s, move them forward. So there are a lot of things we could do short of putting a full carrier strike group in the western Pacific.    Admiral Harris. I think that is a big part of it----    Admiral Harris . Yes.    Admiral Harris. Thanks, sir, for the question. Before I answer, I want to just say that I have spent a lot of time talking to proponents and opponents of UNCLOS in the last 3 or 4 months, and I appreciate the time I have spent with those experts, and I understand their arguments. And I understand those arguments for those folks who are opposed to UNCLOS, but I am a proponent of it. And I think, in the 21st century, our moral standing is affected by the fact that we are not a signatory to UNCLOS. I think there are some economic disadvantages as well. We could get into a discussion about the Russian stuff in the Arctic and how they are using UNCLOS to their advantage, and we are unable to because we are not a signatory to it.    So, you know, I will tell the members of this committee and anyone else that for me, personally, my opinion is the United States should accede to UNCLOS.    Admiral Harris. Sure. So PACOM suffers a shortage of submarines today. My requirements are not being met, as are not the requirements of other COCOMs as well. So we have a submarine force of about 52 attack submarines, and all the COCOMs need them for all their reasons. And when you add up all their requirements, it exceeds the ability of the Navy to provide submarines forward, when you consider a lot of those are in maintenance and a lot of other things.    I worry that we are going to go down to 41, because as we go down to the low 40s, China is going to increase their submarine force, even as they are today. And then Russia, which has the most capable submarine force in the world next to ours, they are moving their latest generation SSBNs, the ballistic missile submarines, to the Pacific. So the Dolgorukiy-class SSBNs got there at the end of last year, and that is just the beginning. And then China, meanwhile, has their Jin, J-I-N, Jin-class SSBNs that they are bringing online, and we are seeing them now.    I feel that I must be able to keep those submarines at risk, and I am able to do so today, but as we go down in numbers, then that becomes a concern to me.    Admiral Harris. Sir, I am not aware of collusion directly. But we know that there is a relationship between North Korea and Iran, but I am not privy to the details of the nuclear collusion, if you will.    Admiral Harris. Well, first, I will talk about the criticality of a layered defense. It is absolutely critical. You know, we have 28,000 American troops on the Korean Peninsula. We have their families. We have several hundred thousand Americans who live and work in South Korea, and the North Korean capability is growing. And they threaten not only our fellow citizens and our allies in Korea; they threaten Japan, they threaten Hawaii, the West Coast in the mainland of the United States, and then potentially the East Coast.    They are on a quest to miniaturize their nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them intercontinentally, and they pose a very real threat to the United States. So I think the layered defense is the only answer to go after the missiles once launched. That means THAAD--and I am glad we are engaged in consultations with Korea on putting a THAAD battery there--Patriot, Aegis, the whole thing.    Admiral Harris. I am pleased with the fiscal year 2017 budget. I was asked to make comments about it up my chain, and my concerns were addressed, and principally those concerns were in anti-surface weapons and anti-surface ship missiles and in advanced fighter aircraft for the PACOM theater.    Admiral Harris. In my case, sir, I would ask for more Joint Strike Fighters, more fifth-generation aircraft to go after the A2/AD threat that we face in the Pacific.    Admiral Harris. Thank you, Congresswoman.    I believe it is, but I don't know that for a fact. I know that the government and the Prime Minister have said that funding will follow, that they are going to fund their aspirations to improve their military and their capability. But I will also add that the primary costs of our U.S. forces in Japan are paid for by Japan.    Admiral Harris. No, ma'am, but I will find out before the closed hearing.    Admiral Harris. It is in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but I will find that out and get back to you on that.    Admiral Harris. And encouraging----    Admiral Harris. Yeah. So everything we are doing is joint these days in the U.S. side. And I think the other countries are observing that and learning from that.    So, last fall, we had an SLS, a senior leader seminar, with the Japan Joint Staff, which is their joint headquarters in Tokyo. And we went through some of our war planning and some of our efforts in that arena. So I think Japan recognizes that they need to be more joint within their military than they are, and they are working with us closely to improve their jointness.    So I was honored last week to travel to Japan, and I spoke at the 10th anniversary of the Japan Joint Staff. And I have been associated with Japan, their military, for most of my career, and they are far and away further along in jointness today than they have been. That is not to say that they don't have a ways to go.    And I think that the jointness between their air force and their navy, for example, should be improved, and I think they recognize that. They are moving toward a greater amphibious capability, and that forces a level of cooperation between their ground self-defense force and their maritime self-defense force.    So I am very optimistic about where Japan is going in terms of jointness and their ability to work with us in a joint manner across our services.    Admiral Harris. That is right.    Admiral Harris. Thanks, Congressman. Good to see you again.    I believe that we need to do everything we can to defend our Nation, and that is my job in the Pacific. I think the Aegis Ashore facility in Kauai is a national treasure, and we should use it to the best of our ability. And I think one of the ways that we could improve our national ballistic missile defense capability is by converting that to a permanent facility with interceptors. It seems reasonable to me, but it demands further study. It demands a lot of study.    I think, at the end of the day, we will learn that what it will do, it would be able to defend Hawaii, and other systems we have would defend the continental United States. But that is good. I am good with that. And that is what I have recommended, that we begin the study to see if it is feasible and what it would take to do it.    There is not only the technical aspects of the architecture, the ballistic missile defense architecture; there is a political dynamic, as you well know, and the whole piece would increase in footprint in Hawaii and all that. So it is a whole effort that needs to be looked at. But I am advocating it because I think we need to do it.    I noted that after I made that statement, that China objected, just as they have objected to the consultations we have with Korea to put THAAD in Korea. And I find it preposterous that China would insert itself in negotiations between us and our Korean ally on how best to defend our Korean ally and our Americans there, and they would interject themselves in our internal discussions of whether we should improve our ability to defend our own homeland.    Admiral Harris. Yeah. That statement that the Chinese spokesman made almost doesn't merit comment. I mean, it is ridiculous, and to me, it is indicative of the spokesperson's tone deafness.    Admiral Harris. As I have testified before, certainly at my confirmation hearing, that I think that if we return to sequester levels for the duration of the law, out to the early 2020s, it will harm our ability dramatically, our ability to defend our Nation. I think all that would be affected. And we are going through that now as we look at downsizing the Army, and should we do that? Where should those forces come from that would be part of the downsizing and everything?    So I have testified before that I think a continued sequester would hurt us significantly in our military readiness, and I stand by that.    Admiral Harris. Well, thanks for the question, sir. Just by definition, I mean, the littoral combat ship is designed to operate in shallower waters than our destroyers and cruisers. I think in where we are now in phase zero, the LCS is a terrific platform to work with our allies and partners in the region.    I think that there is work, though, that could be done to the LCS to make the ``C'' more ``C,'' the combat part of littoral combat ship. And I am pleased, through the Senate and the House and the Congress writ large, that we are looking at doing that. So we are going to, quote-unquote, ``up-gun'' the LCS. And I think that is terrific.    I want our adversaries in the Pacific to think about the LCS the way I thought about the Nanuchkas, Osa's, and Tarantuls of the Soviet Navy back in those days, back during the Cold War. We used to track and be concerned about those little, tiny patrol boats that the Soviets had because they were missile-armed corvettes. And I want the Chinese and the Russians and other adversaries we might have to think about the LCS in that way. And I think we can think of it in that way if we put the right kind of missile on it and up-gun it.    Admiral Harris. That is correct. I stated when I was the Pacific Fleet commander that I value the LCS. I believe there is a place for LCS in the joint force now that I am the PACOM commander, and I look forward to working with them as they come online.    Admiral Harris. Sure. A lot of our friends and partners in the region have small navies. And they want to learn from us or they want to learn from somebody, and I would rather they learn from us than other potential partners. And their navies are small. And when a cruiser comes in there or even a DDG for that matter, it can overwhelm them. And so an LCS is the right platform to do that.    It is also the right platform to train in areas of shallower depths, just by definitions, as I talked about, and the cruisers are smaller so that footprint is smaller. And, for that reason, I think in a partnership environment way, the LCS is, again, an ideal platform.    Admiral Harris. I think it has great potential for some of the mission sets that I have to be concerned about, more so the Pacific Fleet commander would worry about it. But the joint high-speed vessel has a great ability to move a lot of things quickly. And by ``a lot of things,'' I mean, troops and their equipment. And the Army is using a version of that now in the western Pacific.    So I am looking forward to the JHSV EPF coming online in greater numbers. I think that you could put an expedition or a field hospital, for example, on a JHSV and turn it into a hospital ship. We explored that in the last few months in my time as Pacific Fleet commander during Pacific Partnership. That is an exciting new capability that I think we should take a hard look at.    Admiral Harris. Sir, that is the maritime security initiative. I am pleased with where we are with it now. I think we will get about $50 million this year for that. My team is working with OSD on that to figure out the best ways to improve the maritime domain awareness of some of the countries in the region, and I am satisfied with where we are with that this year.    Admiral Harris. In my opinion, sir, CYBERCOM should be an independent combatant command.    Admiral Harris. Yeah. In my opinion, sir, CYBERCOM should be an independent combatant command on the level of PACOM or CENTCOM, as you say. Currently, it is a sub-unified command under USSTRATCOM .    Admiral Harris. No, sir. I think it is being addressed adequately within DOD , and ultimately, the Chairman will make his best military advice known to both the President and the Secretary and a decision will be rendered. And I think that is appropriate in this case at this time.    Admiral Harris. So I have made Vietnam and India focuses--foci--focuses, I guess, of effort for PACOM. I think there are great opportunities in both countries for us to move forward in our relationship and partnerships in the region. So I am excited by our opportunities in Vietnam just for the reasons you mentioned. You know, they are a growing nation. They have a like view with us of China and our concerns in the South China Sea. And they are becoming a player on the world stage, and they are certainly a player in ASEAN .    So I look forward to continuing our relationship with Vietnam. I appreciate the fact we are able to increase our trade with Vietnam, including in the defense arena. I went to Vietnam when I was a Pacific Fleet commander, and I look forward to having the opportunity to go there as a Pacific Command commander.    Admiral Harris. Yes, ma'am. It is a significant concern of mine, the numbers of fighters that are leaving PACOM countries and going to the fight. Of greater concern are those, however, that are returning because not only are they even more radicalized; now they are militarized, weaponized, and so that is a concern.    I am concerned by some of the trends I am seeing in the region. In one of the countries, recently, there was a Pew survey where over 50 percent of the respondents said it was okay to execute a Muslim who converted to some other religion; 30 percent of the respondents in that country said it was okay to use violence in the name of Islam. That sounds like something coming right out of the pages of the ISIS handbook. So I worry about that quite a bit.    I made the comment in the past that there are more Muslims in the PACOM region than in Central Command.    Admiral Harris. And so Islamic extremism is an area of concern, as I mentioned in my opening statement, and we look at that very closely. And fortunately, Special Operations Command Pacific, SOCPAC, is there, and Admiral Kilrain is charged with monitoring that and having an effect on that.    Admiral Harris. Thanks, sir.    In trying to dance on the unclassified side of this question, I will say that I am concerned about principally in the EW environment with Russia and China. They are our peer competitors in this. I think we are investing now more than we have been in electronic warfare, and our new concept electronic warfare maneuver, I think, is gaining a foothold in the Navy and in the joint force.    So I am pleased with where we are moving along, though I think that we need to invest more in it, not only in terms of fiscal resources but also in terms of tactical development.    Admiral Harris. So one of the biggest asymmetric advantages that the United States enjoys over any peer competitor or other competitor in the world is our undersea warfare capability. The submarine gives us an advantage over any other adversary we might face. Unfortunately, those adversaries recognize that, and they are improving and increasing their own antisubmarine warfare and undersea warfare capabilities.    Clearly, while our submarines are far and away better, in my opinion, today, quantity has a quality all its own, and the numbers of Russian and Chinese submarines, particularly Chinese submarines, are a matter of concern. I think the Russian submarine force never took a hiatus at the end of the Cold War, and we are seeing some very impressive platforms come out of Russia, including the Dolgorukiy, as I mentioned earlier, the     So I think that we must continue to invest in our undersea warfare capabilities, not only in terms of numbers of submarines but in improving the submarines that we have. I think the Virginia Payload Module, for example, is fantastic. We can't get enough of them and the capabilities that it brings to the fight.    Admiral Harris. Thank you, sir. I will defer to General Scaparrotti for the specifics of your question with regard to Korea. He has some ideas on that.    But, in general, I am concerned about it. As we work on this with our allies, friends, and partners, we are as strong as only the weakest link in the chain, and cyber could be that weak link. And so their vulnerability to intrusion and exploitation is a matter of concern to me.    General Scaparrotti. Sir, I would echo Admiral Harris' point with respect to Korea as well. We have a good working relationship in terms of our two joint cyber centers and our cyber domain work overall, but it is initial. It is new, and it is developing, and it needs to develop rapidly, because we have a threat. North Korea is active every day. And so my concern is that we act with enough focus and we act fast enough and with enough assets.    The second thing I would say, when you are into that domain, each country has their own concerns about protection of information and capabilities, and so it is an area that is very difficult to work in a collaborative way that you need to at times as well. And that is something that we have got and other nations have to work their way through in order to really close the gaps that we have got to close in our systems.    Admiral Harris. That is a great question and timely too, ma'am, because I go to India on Monday to keynote the Raisina Dialogue event in New Delhi.    I view India as our great strategic opportunity in PACOM, and we need to do as much as we can with India in a mil-to-mil sense and in every other sense. We have a terrific ambassador there in Richard Verma, who is looking aggressively at ways to improve our relationships with India across the board. And I am excited by that.    With regard to the sale of F-16s to Pakistan, while I don't have a professional opinion on that sale itself, certainly it will affect some aspect of our relationship with India. I know that I will be asked about it when I go to India, and I hope to be able to tell them that that sale is just one aspect of many military sales we make across the world, and that we view our relationship with India very importantly. And I hope that we can work through this sale and their perception of it to continue to improve our relationship with India.    Admiral Harris. So we are moving out aggressively in the technical field with the DTTI initiative that Under Secretary Kendall is pushing. And I think that is excellent. There are some what we call foundational agreements that have to be executed with partner nations in order to move, quote-unquote, to the next level. And we are working with India on the signing of those foundational agreements.    One of those is the LSA, Logistics Support Agreement, which allows us to do acquisition cross-servicing, for example. Another one is called the CISMOA , and it involves communications security so that we can be assured that India will protect our communications as we would protect theirs. And so these are foundation agreements that we enact with every country we work with.    We have not gotten to the point of signing them with India, but I think we are close. We are closer now than we ever have been. And I am encouraged by what I am hearing from my colleagues in India, and I look forward to having that discussion with them when I go there next week.    Admiral Harris. A great question, sir. And I think that the NATO model, as I mentioned before, doesn't work for the Pacific. So you have to look at each of our treaty allies individually and look at those--that subset of treaty allies where we have major concentrations of U.S. forces. And who is the greater beneficiary of that, or who are the beneficiaries of that?    Certainly, part of the beneficiary of us having a large carrier strike group bring expeditionary force presence in Japan is us. We are there for us and the values that we hold dear and what is important to the United States. Certainly, it is a benefit to Japan. And so our obligation to Japan under our treaty is to defend them and their obligation to us under that same treaty is to provide us a place from which we can defend them. So that is simplistic, but that sort of gets at that issue.    So they provide us an enormous host nation funding level--which I promised I would get to you in the closed session--to foot the bill, if you will, for U.S. forces that are based in Japan. And that model extends to Australia, for example. We are undergoing host nation funding discussions with Australia now as we move a sizable Marine and Air Force presence to Darwin and Tindal. And the level of that funding and how much it should be is a subject of negotiation. We certainly get a benefit from operating out of Australia, as do the Australians.    Singapore is another case, a very important case. Singapore is not a treaty ally, but it is certainly an important strategic partner to us. And they allow us to put our littoral combat ships, to rotationally deploy them out of their nation, and they have agreed to allow us to operate rotationally P-3s and P-8 surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft. And we get that benefit from operating out of Singapore because of our interests in the South China Sea, Strait of Malacca, and the eastern Indian Ocean.    Admiral Harris. I am, Mr. Chairman. We are seeing in the Pacific, as I mentioned before, their new Dolgorukiy-class SSBN. I remind folks that there are 3,000 miles of Russian coastline that is in my area of responsibility, including six major strategic bases from which they deploy their submarines, their ships, and their long-range bomber aircraft.    We are seeing long-range bomber aircraft patrols increasing in East Asia. They circumvented Japan just recently. And their ship task forces are operating in the region as well.    The Chairman. We often don't think of Russia in your theater, but as you just described it, they have a big presence there.    Admiral Harris. Yes, sir. I think of them often.    The Chairman. I appreciate the fact that you do.    I recently had someone say that they were meeting with a Chinese official who said explicitly: You are the past; we are the future.    I think many of us had not expected the degree of aggression, provocation just within the past few years that we see from China. Do you believe that that is their attitude, and do you have a reason why we are seeing it seemingly sped up, certainly in their activities in the South China Sea?    Admiral Harris. Mr. Chairman, I do believe that that is their attitude. As I testified yesterday, I think they are on--they have a goal of certainly regional hegemony, and they would like to see the United States out of what they consider their affairs.    But I think that their provocations are causing the other countries in the region to look hard at their relationships with China, and they are turning to the United States as their security partner of choice. And you have to ask yourself why these countries, who were formally leaders in the Non-Aligned Movement, for example, are turning away from China and turning toward the United States, not only giving us access to their bases for our ability to operate but increasingly in terms of trade and military interoperability.    So I think that the statement from China that, quote, ``We are the future, and you are the past,'' unquote, I think that is another indication of the tone deafness of the spokesman who made that comment.    The Chairman. Fair point. The key for us then is to be a reliable, credible partner for these nations who are turning to us, and that gets back to the responsibilities of this committee, in part.    Thank you both for being here and testifying. I think, if it is okay with you all's schedule, what I would like to do is just within about 5 minutes or so reconvene upstairs in our SCIF, 2337, and continue on a classified or have a classified discussion.    But, for now, this hearing stands adjourned.    =======================================================================                            February 24, 2016      =======================================================================                           February 24, 2016=======================================================================                  =======================================================================                           February 24, 2016=======================================================================          Admiral Harris. We further leverage our relationship with Japan to maintain peace and security through continued cooperation and support as they implement their national security strategy and legislative changes in the newly passed Peace and Security Legislation.    Japan's 2013 National Security strategy, their first-ever published strategy, emphasizes the need to make ``proactive contributions to peace.''    We welcome this approach by the Japanese and are cooperating with them to help them identify their priorities and coordinate with USPACOM and other partners (e.g. Australia) to complement our Theater Campaign Strategy.    For example, Japan is embarking on a program to ``build partner capacity,'' especially maritime domain awareness capability and capacity for partners such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Those efforts by Japan are complementary to our own efforts to help our partners manage their own security environment, and we are using venues such as security assistance synchronization/coordination fora to work together to maximize the benefits to countries like the Philippines.    Japan is very early in its process of executing its new strategy and building partner capacities. Our coordination and synchronization with them on this new strategy are also in the early stages, but Japan is making progress and we are learning how to work together to maintain peace and security in the region.    USPACOM will continue to encourage and support Japan in the conduct of presence operations throughout the region and, hopefully, we will see Japanese freedom of navigation operations in the future. As Japan looks to become more active in the theater, the regular presence of Japanese ships, aircraft and personnel operating in accordance with international law supports and reinforces our own messages about adherence to international norms, law and standards of behavior.                                 ______                                     Admiral Harris. USPACOM relies heavily on space-based capabilities to conduct joint functions necessary in the execution of our OPLANs. Commanders at all levels rely on satellite communications (SATCOM) to command and control their forces and conduct Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) across the range of military operations. The USPACOM area of responsibility spans over half the globe and available SATCOM is a high-demand, low-density resource. Space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities provide crucial intelligence data support to provide warning and enable targeting, force deployment and defense. Space-based positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), primarily from global positioning system (GPS), is fundamental to the maneuvering of forces and is a critical enabler for search and rescue efforts during peacetime and conflict. Finally, timely missile warning is essential to support active and passive defense of U.S., allied and civilian infrastructure and personnel.    As the shared domain of space continues to grow increasingly congested and contested, adversaries continue to develop means to curtail our access to space-enabled capabilities. I have significant concerns regarding China's continuing development and fielding of lethal and non-lethal counter-space systems, as these systems can threaten my ability to achieve OPLAN objectives. USPACOM requires resilient space capabilities to support operations. Resilience is achieved through careful consideration of the existing and required space, ground, and terminal segments of space systems to maximize flexibility and minimize vulnerability. As these threats continue to mature, the U.S., in coordination with our allies and partners, must develop and implement both material and non-material solutions to mitigate these threats.    Admiral Harris. ______                                     Admiral Harris. To dominate the cyber-battlefield, USPACOM requires growth in the areas of cyber personnel, training, and tools. USPACOM requires additional personnel capable of conducting cyberspace operations planning and to effectively command and control the cyber mission forces operating in the Pacific theater. These personnel and the collective DOD cyberspace professionals require additional training in cyber intelligence, operations, and planning to better react to rapidly evolving cyberspace threats. Lastly, USPACOM requires additional tools such as a common operational picture capable of providing situational awareness for all three cyberspace lines of operation: DOD Information Network Operations, Defensive Cyberspace Operations, and Offensive Cyberspace Operations within the USPACOM area of responsibility. These tools would enhance my ability to create effects within cyberspace to counter the constant advancement of our adversaries' cyberspace capabilities.    I support the establishment of US Cyber Command as an independent combatant command. I believe this will enhance unity of effort within the department and accelerate the coordination and execution of global cyberspace operations.    Admiral Harris. Using Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 1263, ``South China Sea Initiative'' authority, the United States Department of Defense is planning to spend approximately $50 million this year to develop the naval and maritime law enforcement capabilities of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, and Brunei by investing in systems and training for those nations' navies and certain maritime law enforcement agencies. Congressional notification of specific capabilities is planned for March 2016 in accordance with U.S. law.    USPACOM has also made a number of investments in maritime security and maritime law enforcement in the Southeast Asia region using the DOD Counternarcotics Program. Specifically, there are three countries where USPACOM has ongoing efforts. First, in the Philippines, USPACOM has a long-running program in the Sulu Sea area to enhance the capability of the Philippine National Police Maritime Group. USPACOM provided extensive training and infrastructure development to expand the effectiveness of this element in policing the Sulu Sea area. In Cambodia, we have a multi-year effort underway with their National Committee for Maritime Security based in Sihanoukville, to expand their operational capability. Lastly, in Vietnam, USPACOM is in the beginning stages of program development with the Vietnam Border Guards to enhance their capabilities to combat illegal entry, transnational crime, smuggling and trade fraud.    Admiral Harris. Admiral Harris. China has been using a hybrid warfare approach (blending conventional and irregular forces to create ambiguity, seize the initiative, and paralyze the adversary which may include the use of both traditional military and asymmetric systems) for years to incrementally increase its control over its South China Sea claims and to put greater pressure on other South China Sea claimants. It has been using a similar approach to challenge Japan's exclusive administration of the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. This is a whole-of-government Chinese approach that incorporates military and civil maritime forces, diplomacy, economic carrots and sticks, and legal warfare. If unchecked, this approach, I believe, will allow China eventually to be in a position through coercion or force to wrest control of the islands and features it claims in both the East and South China Seas.    This approach is a challenge to the U.S. and its allies because it demands a unified, whole-of-government effort to counter it. Military action alone will not be sufficient to counter a Chinese approach that is designed to achieve its goals while remaining below the threshold of military conflict. That is why coordination among the interagency and the strengthening of our alliances and partnerships in the region are so important.
