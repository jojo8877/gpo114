    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would first like to ask for unanimous consent to enter a Statement into the record by our colleague, Congresswoman Marcia L. Fudge, who represents the 11th District of Ohio.    Ms. Kelly. Thank you.    Ms. Kelly. I would like to focus a bit on the occurrence specifically of non-citizen voter fraud.    Secretary Husted, your office released a report on voter fraud in May 2013, including a review by 88 county boards of election in Ohio. According to that report, over five million total votes were cast in Ohio in that election. According to a letter you sent to the Ohio Attorney General, Mike DeWine, on December 18, 2013, how many instances of non-citizen voter fraud did you refer for the investigation?    Ms. Kelly. And what happened with those cases?    Ms. Kelly. So you wouldn't say people maliciously were trying to do something wrong if they didn't even know or some of the things you just said.    Ms. Kelly. OK. So 17 cases of non-citizen voter fraud, so that, as I think one of my colleagues said, represents 0.0003 percent of the over five million total voters in Ohio.    I would like to say I believe it is a misallocation of time, money, and committee resources to combat a voting problem that is practically non-existent. This is especially true when many States are taking steps to make voting more difficult for eligible Americans by curtailing early voting hours and other barriers. We need to combat that problem. And I believe this is especially important to make this point now, as this is the fiftieth anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, and it is utterly ridiculous in 2015 that American citizens are still fighting for the right to vote.    I yield back.
