    Mr. Weber. Thank you.    Mr. Kerr, you said earlier isolated wetlands were not regulated by the EPA according to a Supreme Court case. Can you give me the name of that case?    Mr. Weber. S-w-a-n-k?    Mr. Weber. Perfect. Thank you.    Mr. Eisenberg, you said manufacturers use one-third of the energy in the United States. You know, I have five ports in Texas. We export a whole lot of things and we have a lot of petrochemical industry and oil and natural gas and on and on and on. When I speak to groups, I often say that the things that make America great are the things that America makes. How do we do that with a stable, reliable, affordable, dependable energy supply? Mr. Kerr, would you agree with that, that America is great because of the things we make and we have a good energy supply to fuel, for lack of a better word, our industry?    Mr. Weber. Mr. Kovacs, would you agree with that?    Mr. Weber. Dr. Paulson, would you agree with that?    Mr. Weber. Mr. Eisenberg, would you agree with that?    Mr. Weber. Good. Mr. Eisenberg, you also said that 65 percent of the controls the EPA was mandating were not identifiable. Is that true?    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. And Mr. Kovacs, if I remember your testimony, you said that the EPA itself said this was going to be the most expensive regulation in history but that it wouldn't impact states.    Mr. Weber. So that was your comment, right?    Mr. Weber. Okay. Good. So let me come back to you, Mr. Kovacs. It's the most expensive regulatory rule in history but it's not going to impact states. Does that sound commonsensical to you, Mr. Kovacs?    Mr. Weber. So is your answer no, it's not commonsensical?    Mr. Weber. Mr. Kerr, would you agree that that statement doesn't sound commonsensical? It's the most expensive regulation in history but it won't impact states.    Mr. Weber. Dr. Paulson, would you agree with that?    Mr. Weber. Mr. Eisenberg, would you agree with that?    Mr. Weber. Mr. Eisenberg, when an energy plant builds a plant--and I had a nuclear plant in my district when I was state rep. When an energy plant--when someone comes in to build an energy plant, permitting and all, the process takes three to five years?    Mr. Weber. If we're lucky. Okay. So if it's that hard on us and the EPA is making it harder and harder and harder, and it's billions of dollars, does it surprise you that some of those investors that have that kind of money to invest actually send that money overseas? Does that surprise you?    Mr. Weber. Dr. Paulson, does that surprise you?    Mr. Weber. It's above your pay level, pay grade?    Mr. Weber. Mr. Kovacs, does that surprise you?    Mr. Weber. Mr. Kerr?    Mr. Weber. Okay. You know, when I was a state rep I was on the environmental reg committee in Texas and I came up here to Congress--D.C.--in March of 2010 to an Energy and Environment Committee Meeting, National Conference of State Legislators, NCSL. I heard with my own ears an Under Secretary for the EPA back then say that they wanted to permit farms because of global warming, greenhouse gases, average farm permit $26,500 per farm. Now, they had done the math, and Doctor, I trust you can do math. Okay, good. You didn't seem to want to weigh in on most of the other questions. They had calculated the income stream--now, this is their words, not mine--a revenue stream of $600 million. It turns, you know, that the streams on farms and ranches aren't the only streams the EPA is interested in, okay? Six hundred million dollars. Now, is the EPA really only interested in science when they say they want to permit farms and it produces a revenue stream of $600 million? Does that sound like they're interested in more than science, Mr. Eisenberg?    Mr. Weber. They do. They're going to kill our energy supply if we're not careful, and Dr. Paulson, we're going to wind up, poor kids are going to all be broke. They're going to be healthy but we're all going to be broke. That's the danger of losing jobs and sending our energy overseas because China and Mexico and India are not going to follow suit.    So I'm going to stop there. That's my editorial, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you letting me go over. I yield back.
