    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, Mr. Secretary and General Dempsey. Good to see you again.    I wanted to talk a little bit about that--the AUMF that was just discussed in this wide scope that you just mentioned. You know, one of the questions I had was the hostility.    Would the--if the hostility--it doesn't say anything about the termination of hostilities at the 3-year period.    Is it your feeling that hostilities could continue and that we could have actions against ISIL beyond the 3 years as currently written and implemented?    Mr. Aguilar. General.    General Dempsey. My military experience and judgment suggests that the answer of your question is it will likely extend beyond 3 years.    Mr. Aguilar. Could it extend--could hostilities extend without a new AUMF by a new commander?    General Dempsey. If I understood the question, the enemy gets a vote, as we say, on how long hostilities extend.    I don't--I honestly don't understand the question.    Mr. Aguilar. Sure, sure. I guess what I am trying to understand is, is as proposed, if Congress gives the authority to use military force, we have this 3-year window which you both said is--you know, offers a flexibility but is more a political discussion than anything and it allows the new President to make that determination.    Absent a new discussion about AUMF, could hostilities continue in perpetuity beyond the 3-year window?    Mr. Aguilar. One of the other pieces that isn't discussed is detention policies within the AUMF and this was discussed in another hearing that this committee had as well.    Could you provide us with examples of what U.S. forces could and could not do with respect to detention policies under the AUMF, under the proposed AUMF?    Mr. Aguilar. General.    General Dempsey. I have nothing to add to that, Congressman.    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you.    I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Thank you.    Dr. Fleming.
