    Ms. Frankel. Thank you. Interesting discussion. I am going to follow up on that, but just first, quick question is, it sounds like what you are saying here today is that you need more assets to do a more effective job. Are the new assets, is it new technology or is it more of the assets that you have and you just need more of them?    Ms. Frankel. Thank you. I now want to just follow up on Mr. Sanford's. I thought it was interesting questions you had. I will just say it in a commentary. I think we spend $310 million a month in Iraq and Syria, and I think that a lot of people are questioning that. But I would like you, if you could, in that context, I would like to hear you make the argument as to the national security argument. That's what I would like you to have a little more detail on, why you feel your mission is so important, how it affects our national security?    Ms. Frankel. OK. Thank you very much.
