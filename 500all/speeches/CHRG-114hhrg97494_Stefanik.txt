    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Over the course of the war in Afghanistan, we saw ground combat vehicles undergo a number of upgrades and additions because of new and increasing threats. But specifically in the Army, protecting the safety of our soldiers also added additional weight of combat vehicles, and, therefore, we had subsequent challenges to maneuverability and rapid deployability.    I represent the Army's 10th Mountain Division, and lightweight weapons systems, body armor, and operational mobility are essential capabilities for the 10th Mountain. So the struggle as I see it is how do you balance the weight against the protection, against the budget? So for example, obviously a vehicle built out of titanium would address the weight challenges, but the cost would be much greater.    So how can we as Congress help the DOD make those needed upgrades or obtain new and affordable materials which are able to stop emerging threats?    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you. Mr. Francis, do you have anything to add?    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you, my time is expired. I yield back.    The Chairman. Ms. Speier.
