    Mr. Schiff. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for recognizing me and allowing me to attend this important hearing. I look forward to working with you, as well as the Administrator, to ensure NASA receives the necessary funding to fulfill its core missions. I may be on leave technically, but my heart is still very much with NASA and my commitment as well.    In particular, I am hopeful that Congress can work with NASA to provide the funding for NASA's Planetary Science Division, so that we can continue to learn more about our solar system from Mars 2020 to a mission to Jupiter's exciting moon Europa. These missions must be fully funded and made a priority for both NASA and the Congress. I share the conviction that our Chairman has that we need to make every effort to fund the priorities of the Decadal Survey. These are the nation's top most scientific priorities and the potential for really revelatory discoveries is just so exciting. And so I stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our Chairman.    And I wonder, Mr. Chairman, if I could submit questions for the record, if I am permitted to do so.    Mr. Schiff. But I thank the gentleman for allowing me to attend and for all of his great advocacy for planetary science and for all of NASA. I am happy to yield back.    Mr. Schiff. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
