    Mrs. Torres. Dr. Dorsey, is the social cost of carbon a brand new concept?    Mrs. Torres. Thank you.    Before the social cost of carbon, how would the government value economic damages in the regulatory context, like damage from flooding, increased health care costs, or the economic damage to the agricultural sector?    Mrs. Torres. And if we threw away the social cost of carbon and stopped putting those costs on the blocks, would the cost of those damages magically go away?    Mrs. Torres. So there is no magic eraser and a board that we can just make all of this reality go away?    Mrs. Torres. So are we already paying for these costs?    Mrs. Torres. I live about 60 miles from the beach. I am looking forward to having beachfront property in the near future. So if we are already paying for these costs, all we are doing with the social cost of carbon is really acknowledging the existence of these costs, correct?    Mrs. Torres. It is a framework that we ought to be utilizing as our population continues to grow and we continue to expand, whether it is through development or just population growth, preparation for that, correct?    Mrs. Torres. Is there anything else you would like to add to that?    Mrs. Torres. So what you are saying is that these policies are really not written in concrete. We can go back and revisit, should climate change in the opposite direction.    Mrs. Torres. Right. What do you have to say to first responders? Their job is a bit more challenging as they prepare to respond to catastrophes that happen because of climate change.    Mrs. Torres. Thank you for your testimony.    I yield back.    The Chairman. Thank you.    Mr. Gosar.
