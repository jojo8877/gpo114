    Mrs. Torres. Thank you. Ms. Goldfuss, as my home state of California grapples with a fourth consecutive year of drought, it is no secret that climate change is real, and is already having a negative impact on California's water resources. From reduced snow pack to a rising sea level, warming temperatures will continue to strain our state's water storage capacity, as well as posing a threat to millions of acres of farmland.    And as this demand for water supply continues to grow, we urgently need to invest in and upgrade our water infrastructure. As a former mayor, I know, from firsthand experience, that our local government budgets lack the resources for the planning and permitting of vital projects.    Can you expand on how the NEPA process can streamline the permitting and planning process across all levels of government, to ensure that local and state governments can build projects that increase efficiency and make our economies more competitive?    Mrs. Torres. Thus expediting projects, and not having to duplicate reports.    Mrs. Torres. As the one cited by Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you.    Mr. Clark, some have suggested that this draft guidance is forcing agencies to use an outdated law--in their opinion, NEPA--to address something that was seen as a problem when the law was passed; namely, climate change.    However, the beauty of NEPA is that it is flexible, adaptable law that was intended to help the government incorporate new scientific information into the decisionmaking. Will you please explain why this guidance is appropriate under     Mrs. Torres. Thank you, and I yield the rest of my time.    The Chairman. Thank you. Dr. Benishek.
