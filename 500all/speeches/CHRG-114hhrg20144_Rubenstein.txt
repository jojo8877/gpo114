    Mr. Rubenstein. Hi. My name is Harry Rubenstein. I am the chair of the Division of Political History at the National Museum of American History. And this is an inkstand that sat on the desk of Thomas Eckert, Major Thomas Eckert, at the War Department's telegraph office. And as you know, Abraham Lincoln would go to the telegraph office once or twice a day to keep tabs on what was happening during the Civil War. And in the summer of 1862, rather than swapping stories and jokes with the telegraph operators, he sat quietly at Major Eckert's desk and began to work on what became the Emancipation Proclamation. And so Major Eckert kept this and eventually saved it and presented it to the government.    The inkwell will be in the opening of the African American Museum and will then move back to American History for our exhibition on American democracy.    Thank you.    Mr. Rubenstein. So what these are, so you can see that these are part of the stand, but these are little inkwells.    Mr. Rubenstein. And what is on top are little figures of griffins.    Mr. Rubenstein. Griffins.
