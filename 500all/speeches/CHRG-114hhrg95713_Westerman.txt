    Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for coming here today for this important hearing.    I will add that I have a lot of national forests in my district, and I spend a lot of time driving through them. Last year on the campaign trail, there was a one-vehicle accident in a very remote area; and Forest Service law enforcement were the first ones on the scene. They were the first responders. It was in an area where there was no cell phone reception, but they were able to use their radios and get other emergency personnel there.    So, they often work in remote areas by themselves, and I think the folks on the ground are doing a fantastic job at least in the national forest where I live.    Mr. Larkin, in his testimony Mr. Schoppmeyer explained that decriminalizing the Lacey Act would cripple the good guys in the fight to keep visitors safe and our greatest national treasures accessible to all. Could you give us your perspective on this view?    Mr. Westerman. Thank you.    Sheriff Brown, I appreciate your suggestions to improve law enforcement with the Forest Service. Some would suggest that they are merely a paranoid attempt to reduce the authority of the Federal Government. Without legitimizing that opinion, can you speak to why this is a question of safety and not just political theater?    Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
