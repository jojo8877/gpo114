    Ms. Adams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks to both of you for your testimony today.    The recent outbreak of avian flu was highly detrimental for egg prices in the U.S., which negatively impacts consumers and our egg users in the baking and restaurant industry. Worse, disruptions in food supply hurt our most vulnerable.    Ms. Beckham, while we can't stop every pathogen that travels through our ports of entry, what investments can we make to mitigate the damage from animal diseases that harm our nation's food?    Ms. Adams. Thank you very much. And let me apologize for not referring to you properly, Dr. Beckham.    The 12th District, which is the district that I represent in North Carolina, is home to my alma mater, North Carolina A&T State University, which includes the Plant Biotechnology Research Lab at Carver Hall on the campus. What opportunities are there for 1890 institutions to participate in research against crop diseases?    Ms. Adams. Okay. And finally, Dr. Beckham, one of the major diseases that concerns farmers and the agriculture industry is an outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease in the United States, and you have made reference to that. If an outbreak occurred in North Carolina, how quickly and effectively could a vaccine be developed for U.S. livestock?    Ms. Adams. Great. Thank you very much.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    The Chairman. The gentlelady yields back.    Mr. Abraham, 5 minutes.
