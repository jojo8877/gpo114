    Mr. Shimkus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a great panel. I appreciate you all being here.    I want to go to Adelstein, Commissioner, and Governor Lewis real quick to highlight the challenges because especially the environmental review process, especially on Federal lands, is a burden. So have you thought through how local municipalities and they do their zoning outside of Federal lands and how we could marry that with which goes on there and can you comment on that?    Mr. Shimkus. Let me get to Governor Lewis on the Federal properties because that is another big challenge because they have got to get past the Government land issue, and Governor, really, the question is, can't we force a zoning issue, get you guys the zoning ability like we do municipalities?    Mr. Shimkus. Let me get Governor Lewis to respond.    Mr. Shimkus. Great. Thank you.    Mr. Slinger, let me go to you real quick. My largest community in my Congressional district is 33,000 people. When do you think Google would hit that community on your timeline?    Mr. Shimkus. But I am not the chairman of the committee so I don't have as much power.    Mr. Shimkus. So it is the same type of debate as we are talking with the rural or the Federal lands deployment, the ease of being able to have access and a timely response.    And let me finish up with Mr. Moffett. It is all about return on investment--I don't care how people want to marry it--if you believe in the capital model. So if a rural area can't make a go based upon the formula, then you have to be able to dip into RUS or other forms of low-interest loans to make the business sense. Is that correct?    Mr. Shimkus. And also, time is money. So any delay, as what we have just talked about here, affects the ability for someone to go to the capital markets to make a pitch that they are going to get their return on investment that you propose.    Mr. Shimkus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back my time.
