    Ms. CHU. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    You know, on one hand, there are instances of these ineligible firms that have been certified for the HUBZone. On the other hand, there are these vast areas that do not have HUBZone certified firms operated within them. In fact, when researching this, I found that while my district has pockets of census tracks that would qualify for HUBZone status, there are only two HUBZone certified firms in the entire area. I understand that across the country there are only 5,600 participants in the HUBZone program and nearly 90 percent of HUBZones do not have a single certified firm. So can you tell me, for the panel, can you tell us why you believe that the program is not being utilized in certain areas?    Yes, please.    Ms. CHU. Mr. Shear?
