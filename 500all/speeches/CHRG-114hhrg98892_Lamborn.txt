    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks for having this important hearing, and thank you all for your contributions.    Former Admiral Winnefeld, I want to ask you in particular, and by the way, thank you for your distinguished service, and it was good to get to know you when you came to Colorado Springs. As the chairman's designee heading the JROC, how do you feel the current service-led acquisition system serves national requirements, including nuclear forces, NC3 , space, and missile defense, are these capabilities service priorities?    Mr. Lamborn. Excellent. That is great to hear. And kind of a followup, can you explain why strategic missile warning, ITW/AA , is important? Should this capability be considered a part of NC3 as opposed to a space system, which it currently is?    Mr. Lamborn. Okay. Well, thank you. And as another followup, have you seen the Air Force apply appropriate priority to its modernization?    Mr. Lamborn. Okay. Now, what would you tell Air Force senior leadership if someone were to suggest that, well, we can trade 1 or 2 minutes' worth of missile warning time in exchange for saving some budget resources, which we can apply elsewhere, what kind of tradeoff would you consider that?    Mr. Lamborn. Okay. And Mr. Hale, Ms. Fox, in the short time we have left, do you have any observations on our dialogue?    Mr. Lamborn. Okay.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.    The Chairman. Mr. Veasey.
