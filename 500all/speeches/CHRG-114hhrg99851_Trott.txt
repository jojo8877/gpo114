    Mr. Trott. I would like to thank Chairman Royce for scheduling H.R. 3694 for consideration, and also my colleague, Representative Deutch, for his partnership and leadership on the Stop Organ Trafficking Act. I also want to thank Mr. Smith for his commitment and years of work on this important issue and Representative Keating for his helpful amendment.    The illegal trafficking of human organs has long been a terrible and heinous crime, but, unfortunately, the United States policies and laws have not kept pace. China has inexplicably been targeting Falun Gong for years. And more recently, ISIS has reportedly been resorting to this brutal practice to finance their nefarious activities and strike fear in the hearts of innocent people.    Late last year, ISIS released a religious edict stating that taking organs from a living captive to save a Muslim's life was permissible, making religious minorities in Iraq, like the Chaldeans and the Assyrians, even more vulnerable targets.    Mr. Chairman, it is time the United States shine a bright light on this problem and take a leading role in combating this heinous crime, standing with the world's most vulnerable. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this timely and necessary legislation.    Thank you, and I yield back my time.
