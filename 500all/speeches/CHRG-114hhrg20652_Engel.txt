    Mr. Engel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Wolosky and Mr. Lewis, welcome back and thank you for your service.    Last time you gentlemen were here I made my views on the Guantanamo Prison pretty clear and I would ask that my opening statement from that hearing be included as part of the record of this hearing.    Mr. Engel. To recap, the prison should be closed. National security experts of both parties agree with me. In fact, I have a letter here from 36 retired generals and admirals calling for the prison's closure and I ask that it be included in the record.    The prison is a waste of money and a propaganda tool for terrorists. End of story, as far as the prison goes. There were, however, some issues raised about transferred detainees at the last hearing that deserve some follow up and I say transferred rather than released because there's an extensive process that goes into removing a detainee from the prison and sending him to another country.    It's not as though they are just set loose. But it is important to know how exactly are we monitoring transferred detainees and assessing the risk they pose. Those are good questions.    But because they deal with intelligence methods we can only discuss them in a closed classified setting. My understanding is that the administration offered to do just that and that offer was rebuffed.    I hope that after this hearing in a few weeks or so we can have a closed classified setting to get answers to some questions that you are not really allowed to say here in open session.    So why are we here? The title of today's hearing is demanding accountability of the administration's reckless release of terrorists from Guantanamo.    Since we say reckless release, it sounds like people's minds are made up and I want to make sure all the facts are on the table because I think there's plenty of blame to go all around. I think the chairman raises legitimate issues but I do think there's plenty of blame to go around.    First, the vast majority of Guantanamo detainees were transferred out of the prison before President Obama took office. A total of 780 detainees have been held in Guantanamo.    During the Bush administration, 500 were transferred out, compared to 159 detainees under President Obama. Secondly, let's look at the number of transferred detainees who returned to the battlefield. The figure 30 percent gets thrown around a lot but what goes into that number?    Turns out it includes the total number of transferred detainees that we know for sure have returned to the fight as well as those suspected of re-engagement over the entire life of the Guantanamo Prison 2001 to present.    During the Bush years, 2001 to 2008, the rate of suspected and confirmed cases of re-engagement was actually higher than that, 35 percent, with 21 percent of the cases confirmed and 14 percent suspected.    So let me say that again. More than one-third of the terrorists that President Bush's administration transferred may have returned to the fight. Now let's contrast that with the Obama administration.    Under President Obama, that number, again, totaling suspected and confirmed cases, drops to 13 percent. Eight percent suspected and just 5 percent confirmed. That 5 percent represents seven people.    Now, I know one person escaping this is one person too much. But I just want to have a balanced hearing here because if we've already made up our minds and talking about the administration being reckless, it doesn't seem to me like we are really here to learn anything more.    I reiterate at most 13 percent of those transfers since January 2009 have re-engaged compared to as much as 35 percent during the previous administration. The contrast is striking. But let's not get lost in the numbers because this is perhaps the most important point.    The transferred detainees who returned to the battlefield and killed Americans were let out during the Bush administration, not during the Obama administration.    So if we are going to paint with a broad brush and say 30 percent of transferred detainees may be going back to the fight and killing Americans, we need to take the whole story and put it into perspective. The Bush administration racked up that average and then some.    The Obama administration has helped to bring it back down. Thirdly, the administration's closure plan would not transfer any person who does not meet the most stringent criteria.    I've heard claims that the remaining detainees are the worst of the worst and the administration simply wants to turn them loose. That's false.    Twenty-nine of 79 remaining detainees are cleared for transfer. Among them are 22 Yemenis. The administration isn't transferring them yet. As a matter of policy we transfer detainees to their home countries. But in the case of Yemen the government cannot provide adequate security assurances.    So the administration has pumped the brakes out of an abundance of caution. We need to find countries that can provide adequate assurances before those 22 are transferred.    That leaves 50. Some of these are really bad guys. Ten of them will stand trial. Another 40 are being legitimately held as prisoners of war. But under no circumstances, in my opinion, is the Obama administration simply opening the gate and releasing dangerous terrorists onto the street.    Look, Guantanamo is a mess and it always has been. No one is blameless. Anyone can cherry pick single cases to paint a picture big or small, good or bad. But I think the facts and the statistics speak for themselves.    And I think what we should do after this, instead of having the witnesses come and tell us that they can only tell us things in a classified briefing, is to spend our time with them after this hearing in a few weeks where we could be in a closed setting getting to the bottom of this matter.    Now, the Foreign Affairs Committee obviously has oversight on this issue. The hearing last March and today's hearing are the only two times that the committee has taken up this issue in the nearly 15 years that Guantanamo Prison has been open. So since we have our top Guantanamo experts with us today, I hope you can give us your opinions on some interesting ideas we've recently heard about that prison. I am going to read you a few quotes.    You may recognize them. I'll give you a hint. It's one of the candidates running for President. Here's the first:        ``This morning I watched President Obama talking about         Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay, which by the way we are keeping         open and we are going to load it up with some bad         dudes. We're going to load it up.''And the second quote:        ``Torture works, okay, folks. Believe me, it works, and         water boarding is your minor form. Some people say it         is not actually torture. Let's assume it is. But they         ask me the question, what do you think of water         boarding? Absolutely fine, but we should go much         stronger than waterboarding. We should go much stronger         because our country is in trouble.''    So I just want to say that I read that because, you know, some people say they want to expand the Guantanamo Prison and torture. I can't think of a worse proposal for our national security. These schemes would only harm us with their allies and provide ammunition to our adversaries. Mr. Wolosky, Mr. Lewis, at some point today maybe we can hear your views on what would happen if we went in that direction.    Again, I hate doing tit for tats but I do think it is not really fair to blame the administration for all the frustrations we have about Guantanamo when we see that there were problems and wrong things done in the previous administration as well. So I look forward to listening to you and hearing your thoughts and thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Engel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Lewis, let me start with you. In a hearing before this committee in March you discussed the issue of former Guantanamo detainees killing Americans.    According to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, none of the former detainees who have gone through a screening process implemented by this administration in the 2009 have harmed Americans.    To quote Mr. Earnest, from March of this year, and I quote him, ``No one who's been released from prison at Guantanamo Bay on President Obama's watch has been implicated in violence against Americans.''    So I would like to ask both of you: How has the Obama administration changed the detainee transfer process from the process used before President Obama took office, or has he not changed it?    I understand it is been changed. How have these changes helped prevent former detainees from harming Americans? So why don't we start with you, Mr. Wolosky?    Mr. Engel. Thank you. You know, I think it is important to put it into context because, look, even one prisoner escaping is one prisoner too much. So we are not going to say that anything is foolproof.    Nothing is foolproof. But I think that if we look and see what the administration has done and the safeguards that they have tried to put in, I feel that we are absolutely doing our best and in fact it is a big improvement than the previous administration.    So let me ask you this. We've heard a lot about the challenges of closing Guantanamo. It is true that some former detainees have re-engaged. I know the chairman is very upset about it and so am I.    But can you help put those cases into context? What are the costs of keeping this facility open and how would halting the transfer of cleared detainees affect terrorist recruitment and propaganda and coalition efforts to degrade and defeat terrorist organizations?    Mr. Engel. I will stop now because I know my time has run out. But I wanted to--you know, the thing that irks the chairman and, in fact, frankly, irks all of us is the fact that this person was sent to Uruguay, and Uruguay, apparently doesn't have the ability to monitor this person who now has left the country. Just briefly, could you talk a little bit about the case or do you need to do it in a classified setting?    Mr. Engel. I would like to do that in closed session. So I am sure we'll make arrangements to do that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Engel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
