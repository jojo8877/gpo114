    Mr. Hinojosa. Thank you, Chairman Neugebauer and Ranking Member Clay, for holding this hearing.    As we examine the process for designating certain financial institutions as systemically important, SIFIs, under the Dodd-Frank Act, we would do well to remember that during the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, the American financial system teetered on the brink of collapse. Every major American financial institution either failed or was taken over by a larger institution or required government assistance to weather the storm.    My first question is for Dr. Simon Johnson.    In your testimony, you indicated that it would be more sensible to measure banks by their total exposure, as defined in the systemic risk reports to include on- and off-balance-sheet items, rather than by their total consolidated assets as is currently done under Dodd-Frank.    Do you think the current measure of $50 billion consolidated assets is a good proxy for banks that pose a systemic risk to our financial system?    Mr. Hinojosa. So with that response, would you keep a bright-line test, or would you suggest a qualitative discretionary approach with Congress outlining the factors for consideration?    Mr. Hinojosa. Okay.    My next question is to Auburn University's Dr. James Barth.    Currently, the top 33 financial institutions control approximately 84 percent of industry assets. The remaining 6,400 banks control the remaining 16 percent of assets.    So do you think the concentration of such large amounts of banking assets in a relative handful of firms is itself a systemic concern?    Mr. Hinojosa. Thank you.    My next question is for Mr. Satish Kini.    There is, at this time, a considerable amount of debate regarding whether the current process for designating a non-bank SIFI by the FSOC is as transparent as it should be. So do you believe that to be the case? Why or why not?    Mr. Hinojosa. My time has expired, and I yield back.
