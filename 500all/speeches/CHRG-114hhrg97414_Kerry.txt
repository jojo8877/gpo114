    Secretary Kerry. Well, thank you. Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman; Madam Ranking Member, my friend Nita Lowey. Mr. Chairman of the full committee, Hal Rogers, thank you very much.    I appreciate the enormously generous welcome from all of you, and I particularly appreciate the opportunity to be able to be here. I think we have some of the best dialogue on the Hill in this committee, and I always appreciate the chance to share thoughts with you.    And that is what I want to do. This is not, this is not a combat. This is really a way to find mutual understanding about the Nation's priorities. Historically, we have always said that politics should end at the water's edge when it comes to American foreign policy, and what we are here to find is the common ground with respect to our interests and our values as we project them in the context of foreign policy.    And that is what foreign policy is. It is the best enhancement of that combination--our values, our interests. There is always a balance. Sometimes one takes a little more precedence than the other, and people are uncomfortable one way or the other. But that is the objective, and, in the end, it is to keep the American people safe and keep our country strong.    You have all laid out a broad array of issues which I couldn't begin, obviously, in just an opening comment to address. So I am going to leave them aside for a minute and honor the notion that you do have a few votes coming quickly and we want to really have the dialogue I talked about. So I am going to give a very, very short summary.    We are here to talk about 1 percent of the budget--1 percent of the entire Federal budget. That is what we put into foreign policy. Between USAID and the State Department and our general operations, you are talking about $50.3 billion. And that 1 percent, my friends, I promise you, will account for more than 50 percent of the history of this era when it is written.    So I personally believe it ought to be much bigger than 1 percent, and I think we have very justifiable reasons for making it so. That is not the budget we have in front of us and that we are arguing about here today, but I ask you to keep that in the forefront of your minds as you think about all of these priorities. Because we are robbing Peter to pay Paul right now. We are cannibalizing some programs--you have mentioned it yourself--to do other things that we need to do that are priorities, and I don't think in the end that serves America as well as we should be.    I think that the richest country on the face of the planet, which has significantly reduced its deficit, can examine its priorities without a sort of rote, automatic process of sequestration or otherwise by which we limit real choices. And I just want to start with that.    Secondly, I will say to you very quickly that this is as complicated a time as, in many ways, we have ever faced, because the world has changed so dramatically in the last 20 years. Everybody is connected to everybody all the time. The numbers of cell phones in even poor countries is staggering.    And the degree to which people know what other people have affects what they want. Aspirations are burgeoning in all kinds of places that it was never allowed to even be thought of, historically. So, in the Middle East, in the Sahel, in the Maghreb, in the Arabian Peninsula, in South-Central Asia, in Asia, I mean, countless places, there are pressures being released that are changing the dynamics of foreign policy.    In many ways, we are looking at a world where states are behaving in the ways--and within the states, all kinds of different entities behaving independently with their own agenda, unlike the sort of clarity that seemed to define the differences in the course of the cold war--communism, freedom, democracy, et cetera. And we know that, in many dictatorships, many of these kinds of aspirations were tamped down, through tyranny and oppression, but tamped down, so we didn't have to cope with them. Now we do.    It is counterintuitive, but the truth is that, notwithstanding the threat of ISIL, notwithstanding people being beheaded publicly and burned publicly and the atrocities that they are perpetrating--and it is a serious, serious challenge to us--notwithstanding that, there is actually less threat and less probability of people dying in some sort of violent conflict today than at any time in human history. And with advances of health and with advances of statehood and other kinds of things, we are living in a very different world.    I am not going to go into all of that now. I just want to end my quick opening by saying to you this: I am proud of the way President Obama and this administration are, in fact, leading on issue after issue after issue. And while some may disagree with the choice that is made and some may feel that not enough was done in Libya, Syria, or in some particular place, I am telling you that never before in our history have so many crises and so many trouble spots and so many larger policy challenges been managed simultaneously and, I think, have been kept on track as much as they are today.    And I will be specific. In ISIL, we built a global coalition that has Arab countries actually flying sorties against Arab countries in the Gulf, 60 nations participating in an effort we will talk about a bit today.    In Iraq, we helped to guide and implement a transition of a government, with choices made by the Iraqis, their choices, their destiny, but we helped to create a framework within which they were transitioning from a Prime Minister Maliki to a Prime Minister Abadi and a new government that we could work with in order to be able to go out and fight against ISIL.    In Afghanistan, we helped to shepherd a coalition government to emerge out of an extremely questionable election and close and negotiate a BSA and hopefully be in a position to transition Afghanistan.    In the Iran negotiations, we are not complete. I don't know if we will get there. But I know that trying is the essence of United States leadership, to find out whether or not there is a way with diplomacy to succeed in preventing a country from getting a nuclear weapon, and that we owe it to our citizens and the world to prove our willingness to try to do it peacefully before we have to make other choices if we did.    On Ebola, there were predictions of a million people dying by Christmastime. At the moment that President Obama made the decision to deploy 4,000 American troops to go over there and help build the capacity to be able to try to prevent that from happening, there were huge questions at the time about how fast it might spread and how dangerous that might be, what might happen.    But because of American leadership pulling together countries all over the world, you can now look at Liberia and Guinea and Sierra Leone and see huge reductions in infection and see that, indeed, Americans are not waking up every day to the news of some new infection and some new challenge.    On AIDS in Africa, we are on the cusp because of our additional efforts, which you have shared, you have helped lead, on the cusp of an AIDS-free generation of children.    In Ukraine, we have held together, cobbled together, pieced together, cajoled, and managed to effect a series of sanctions that have--while not stopping everything altogether, no, nevertheless, has given Ukraine an opportunity to survive as an independent and sovereign Ukraine and has cost Russia a lot.    Mr. Putin may be able to look at what is happening today in Donetsk or Luhansk or Debaltseve and say, wow, I am going a great job on short-term tactical stuff. But I will tell you this: Russia is not doing great right now--50 percent reduction in the ruble's value, $151 billion of capital flight, predictions that Russia will be in recession this next year, extraordinary restraint on growth. And that has happened because of the coordinated sanctions that we put in place.    Now, there is more that I could run through. I am not going to do it all now, but I will just tell you: Between TPP and TTIP, we are pursuing two of the most ambitious and important trade agreements in recent history.    Forty percent of global GDP is wrapped up in the TPP. If we can achieve that, we will have a definition of the new standards of doing business in the region. And even China has said to us, if this works, if it comes together, could we join it? We are far better ultimately seeing a China join an upgraded set of standards for doing business and rules of the economy and trade than to not do that and have others write those rules or have no rules at all.    So I can run through, finally, on climate--we can talk about climate, Mr. Chairman. I hope we will in the course of this. China, up until last year, was an opponent to doing anything about climate change. But because we reached out and worked with them, starting literally a month and a half after I became Secretary, President Obama was able to go over there, and China joined in a deal to announce its targets for the reduction of emissions and fossil fuel dependency and a commitment of a goal to achieve alternative, renewable, and efficient energy.    It is a huge impact. And because of that, in Lima, Peru, other countries came together and joined in to say, we have to make Paris negotiations a success this year.    So I would say to you that, whether it is in the Arctic, the Arctic Council, which we will assume the chairmanship of in about a month and a half, or whether it is on any of these things I have listed--there are many things I haven't listed--cybersecurity, health, health structure--around the planet, the United States of America is proving that, when we lead, we can make a difference. And the world needs that leadership.    And I hope that in this budget we can reflect the fact, ultimately, that the 1 percent we put into these endeavors which result in so much benefit in the long term, so much security to Americans, will not be nickeled and dimed at a critical moment where we need to bolster yet more those things that we are able to do, like the broadcasting, the countermessaging of ISIL, the counterterrorism initiatives we need to employ, the deprivation of the pool of recruits for ISIL. These are intensive efforts, and they will require a financial commitment. And we need to understand the connection.    Mr. Chairman, I think you said something about the importance here of taking the budget role seriously. I know you do. But we need to connect the dots for everybody in America of the money spent out of this committee and the United States Congress on the security of our Nation that comes to us through the work of diplomacy and the work of development on a daily basis.    And, frankly, we have been hurrying ourselves in the past years, where there has been a reduction from the population growth rate and the need and demand for that kind of investment.    Madam Chair, thank you.          Secretary Kerry. Well, we are pushing very hard. In fact, that is a decision that I think is on the President's desk anytime now.    We are tied, as you know, by Congress to a certification process that I have to exercise, and I can certify or I can waive and make a decision what to move. But we have broken certain things out.    One of the things we were waiting for, frankly, Madam Chair, was the announcement of the parliamentary elections. Now, we finally got that announcement. There were a number of people in prison. There has been some harassment of Embassy employees. There have been some other--as you saw, Abd el-Fattah was just sentenced to 5 years for taking part in a protest. And, you know, these are things that matter to us, obviously--the Al Jazeera journalists who are imprisoned, the NGOs who were required to be listed.    So we have been talking as reasonably and as frequently as possible with our friends in Egypt. I have a very good working relationship with the Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry. I have had several meetings with President el-Sisi. I am very grateful to President el-Sisi for his significant cooperation with respect to a number of security issues.    And we want to get them these additional items. And I suspect, Madam Chair, that decisions will be made shortly to try to come to cloture on the, sort of, final choices of how we move on that.    So Egypt has presented one set of challenges. One thing I want to make clear: I believe Egypt is helping enormously with respect to counterterrorism. Egypt is doing a huge amount in the Sinai. Egypt has been helpful with respect to Gaza. And Egypt has been essential with respect to some elements of the peace process, Israel and Palestine. Egypt is could cooperating very significantly with Israel, and there is great intelligence cooperation and so forth.    So, by and large, I believe it is important for us to provide some of these items, and I believe decisions will be forthcoming that will set out how we may in fact proceed forward to do that.    On Jordan, I think you know this; we have had many conversations about it, Madam. I am frustrated, as you are frustrated. And they have been a little frustrated, and I understand that.    Before I received your letter, I met several weeks ago with Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh, whom you all know well, and we signed a memorandum in which we agreed to put $1 billion a year for the next 3 years into the relationship with Jordan. This is before we received the letter from you.    In addition, before I had received the letter from you, I had already initiated a review based on my conversations with Foreign Minister Judeh to find out exactly what item was on request, exactly where it was in the chain of delivery, and why it might have been delayed.    And I have already--I think just about the time I got your letter, I received the answer to all of those questions, and I now have a breakdown of all of those items--tier-one priorities, tier two, tier three.    And so the tier-one items are now mostly on the way or in possession. F-16 spare parts, for instance, pilot survival, night vision, et cetera, are happening. The UH-60 Black Hawks we are trying to figure out. We will shortly notify you with respect to some formal procedures on that.    So I could run through the long list with you. I think it is better, probably, to do that in a classified forum. But I can just tell you that we are on top of this and moving, and these items need to get there as rapidly as possible.    Secretary Kerry. Some. Some.    Secretary Kerry. I think two----    Secretary Kerry . Two people were released. But for every person that gets released, regrettably there have also been announcements of life imprisonments for one thing or another.    Look, we are beginning to understand much better the restraints that President el-Sisi operates under. And there are some. And I think we are beginning to understand, also, some of the difficulties of independent judiciary and independent efforts that reflect on how the process is working there.    What is important is Egypt is committed as a major partner in counterterrorism. And Egypt is critical, its viability is critical to long-term stability of the region. I think the United States needs to reflect that, and the President does in our policy. And I think we are seeing that happen in what is unfolding now.    Secretary Kerry. Well----    Secretary Kerry. Well, Madam Chair, let me just say to you respectfully on this issue of the Kurds--because I have heard this for a while, and I think it is a little out of proportion, if I can say so.    We have provided more than 34 million rounds of light and heavy ammunition to the Kurds, 15,000 hand grenades, 45,000 mortars, 50,000 RPG cartridges, and 18,000 rifles. Thousands more rounds of ammunition and weapons have been identified for donation and are being prepared for delivery now. This is in addition to more than 300 tons of arms and ammunition that the Government of Iraq provided and delivered directly to the Kurds.    We have also provided 25 MRAPs to our Kurdish partners. Hundreds of airstrikes have hit ISIL elements in Mosul and the Sinjar Mountain and other areas of Northern Iraq, which has provided relief to the Kurdish forces. We have established a joint operations center in Erbil that has facilitated unprecedented cooperation with the KRG.    We worked to get--I personally was on the telephone with President Barzani and others to work to create a corridor which helped the Kurds to be able to get into Kobane and help provide relief there and ultimately help win the victory of Kobane.    We have provided $208 million in humanitarian support to deal with displaced Kurds. That is an estimated 850,000 people in the Kurdistan area. We have provided 110 tons of humanitarian supplies to them. We have provided extensive diplomatic engagement with----    Secretary Kerry. Yeah, but I am just----    Secretary Kerry. I am sorry. What was the second?    Secretary Kerry. I will try to answer as many as I can as fast as I can, Congresswoman Lowey.    Let me go to the end. That is probably a good place to begin, which is this question of breakout in 1 year and do we know it is enough and why do we know it is enough and so forth.    Let me make clear what ``breakout'' is in the context that we are talking about. And I want to make clear, also, when we talk about 1 year, we are talking about 1 year for a period of time that we believe sufficient to build the confidence about our access and about the workings of the program and to understand that there isn't a covert track.    But ``breakout'' in the way that many of us thought of it when I was here in the Senate in the 1980s, late 1980s and 1990s--we were debating still the Soviet Union in the 1980s with Ronald Reagan and certain missile systems and so forth--``breakout'' meant your ability to go with nuclear weapons, that you broke out and, man, you had a nuclear weapon right away and you would go do something. That is not what we are talking about here.    What we are talking about here is--``breakout,'' as we apply it to the 1 year we are looking for for this period of time, is the time it takes from when they decide from their constrained and restricted and verified level of enrichment, if they were to kick everybody out and say, we are going at it now, and it is just obvious they are going at it, that would be a breach the moment they did it. You don't need 6 months. The minute they kick you out, you know they are in breach. So if you have a year, you have a lot of leeway.    But that is a timeframe from when they make the decision to not comply to try to get a rush to enough fissile material for one potential weapon. Remember, enough fissile material for one potential weapon, 1 year. That is not having a weapon. That could be years away from having a deliverable weapon or a tested weapon or a weapon that you have to be concerned about.    So if you have a year from the time in which one of your inspectors discovers they are not complying or a year from the time that one of your intrusive cameras or visits or visible inspections of the mining or their uranium or their production or their centrifuges shows you something is up, you can slap sanctions right back on and worse. Or, of course, you always have all the options we have that exist today. We are not giving up one option.    When you say to me, do I know that 1 year is sufficient insurance with respect to the ability to regulate, you better believe it. And do you know what? You know what we have today? You know what Israel has today? Two to 3 months. And the reason it may be 3 or 4 months right now is because of what we put in place with the interim agreement.    Now, remember, Prime Minister Netanyahu thought the interim agreement--quote: ``deal of a century for Iran.'' He thought it was the worst thing that ever happened. And some people in the Congress echoed that when I came up here to talk about the interim agreement.    Well, guess what? Every aspect of the interim agreement has been complied with. The then-20-percent-enriched uranium that threatened Israel is now gone, reduced to zero. The Fordow that then we didn't know what was going on in it that threatened Israel is now inspected on a daily basis. Arak that then threatened it as a potential producer of plutonium and a track for weapons production has been stopped dead in its tracks, and they have not been able to further any commissioning of Arak. That makes Israel safer.    I mean, it defies imagination to make the argument that, if Israel was threatened with a 2-month breakout period and they are now at more months and we are trying to get a year, that they are not safer.    Now, that is just the beginning of the many pieces of this agreement. And I am not going to go into all of the agreement right now, because we don't have an agreement. We may not get an agreement. They may not be willing to do some of the things that you listed that you think are the ingredients of a good agreement. And I am not going to sit here, in fairness, Madam Ranking Member, and go through each of those items because I am not going to negotiate here. I want to negotiate with them and see where we are.    But of course we have to have a resolution of Parchin and a resolution of Arak so it can't produce plutonium on a bomb path and a resolution of Fordow so it is not a secret, hidden enrichment facility and so forth. And those are the things that we are arguing about right now.    Now, the point I would make to everybody is, in the year 2000s, 2003, under the Bush administration, they had a policy of no enrichment. It was American policy. There were 164 centrifuges then spinning--2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008--all during the Bush administration. Nothing stopped. What happened? They kept building. Now they are at 19,000 that could function. There are not that many functioning.    And so, obviously, we pursued a policy for a period of time under a very tough administration that didn't hesitate to use its muscles when it wanted to, didn't use its muscles on that, and the fact is we wind up where we are today. Iran knows how to make fuel. They know how to do this.    So we have to decide, how do we get the best shot at being able to constrain from the production of a nuclear weapon over the course of the future years? Now, that is what we are trying to do, and we are trying to close off each pathway to the bomb--through Natanz, through Fordow, through Arak, and covert. And the test of that will be in the days ahead.    Secretary Kerry. Well, we are going to have a longer discussion, I have no doubt about that, if we get an agreement. And if we don't, we will have a longer discussion about the things we are going to need to do as a result.    A New York Times article last Thursday cited a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran was still refusing to answer longstanding questions about suspected work on weapons designs.    As you say, there is a very short time remaining for conclusion for that framework agreement. And their continued refusal to provide IAEA with answers about past nuclear weapons work, that is troubling. Because if they refuse to answer, how can we be sure that whatever is agreed upon they will live by and abide by?    Secretary Kerry. Well, there are a bunch of questions the IAEA has asked that are going to have to be answered, and we have made that very clear. The IAEA is going to have to get answers to questions.    What is more critical than answering, than having some confession of, oh, yeah, we were doing this back then, is getting the ability to know what they are doing now with clarity and going forward so that you can prevent any development whatsoever.    We presume, I mean, we all have pretty good information, we are in a nonclassified venue here, but I think I can safely say that we have made our presumptions based on the information we have about what they were doing. So we are certainly proceeding with eyes open that it is our belief they had a weapons track, and we understand that we need to respond accordingly in whatever it is that we do here.    Secretary Kerry. Well, there have been no violations of JPOA. I am not sure what he is referring to. There may have been a place or two we had a question, but they were answered. We raised one issue. There was one centrifuge which was being fed at one point in time which we learned of, and we learned of it because of the verification that we had, which, by the way, is far less comprehensive than the verification we want to get ultimately.    But we did learn of it, which is an indication that there was transparency and that we had accountability. And the moment we mentioned it, it was really based on a misunderstanding of what was current. Under the JPOA, under the interim agreement they are allowed to pursue the current level of what they are at. This, we argued, was new, and we won the argument, and they stopped, and that was the end of it.    But, look, a fundamental basis of your question, Mr. Chairman, you said, how can we trust them? This agreement is not based on trust. No arms control agreement is based on trust. Remember, Ronald Reagan's famous ``trust but verify.'' That is a euphemism for make sure you are able to know what is happening. And that is the guideline of this negotiation. It is not based on trust.    You may be able to build some trust. The last year of compliance has, frankly, helped people to have a sense of seriousness of purpose here and intent. The fact that they did destroy their 20 percent uranium stockpile. The fact that they have provided access. The fact that they did stop work on Iraq. I mean, all of these things begin to build a little bit of confidence that this is serious.    But we have to build a structure here that gives us great confidence going out into the future that we will know what they are doing so it isn't relying on anybody's word or on any level of trust.    Secretary Kerry. A lot does depend on it. I agree with you.    Secretary Kerry. Well, I personally don't believe so, Congressman. I think that we have to be very, very careful and very thoughtful about each country's ability to transition and measure our expectations in a very thoughtful way. We should not be automatic and sort of simplistic about that endeavor. We certainly shouldn't stereotype and fit everybody into the same box because every place is different. And the lessons certainly that I have learned in the last 10 or 15 years are that we really need to think very, very carefully about what kind of political space, what capacity there is for the embrace of our vision and at what pace.    We sometimes come crashing in with a sense that we can sort of hold out X amount of aid and say, you have got to do this and this in order to do it. And they kind of look at us nowadays increasingly in many countries and scratch their heads and ask a lot more questions than they used to and are not quite as impressed by the level of our leverage because, frankly, it is significantly diminished, if you want to know the truth.    The Emiratis and Saudis are putting 20 billion bucks a year into Egypt, and we are putting a $1.3 billion or whatever it is, $1.6 billion. And so they look at it and they say, well, do we have to put up with all these headaches since we have got these other folks we could turn to and we will get some help there?    President Putin just paid a very visible, well-received visit to Egypt, and there was an exchange, an agreement for some very significant purchase of weapons and so forth. They would prefer to buy them and have the relationship with America, but they feel like we are sometimes asking more than the market will bear at the rate at which we are looking to them to----    Secretary Kerry. Well, I encouraged them strongly with respect to a number of people they needed to release. They released them. I encouraged them to rapidly move to set the date for the election. They set the date publicly for the election. We encouraged them to do a number of other things. I won't go into all of them here. But to the best of our awareness, they worked hard to try to do those things. They got some done and couldn't get others done, but we know they made a bona fide effort on some of them and ran into various roadblocks.    Secretary Kerry. Thank you, Congressman. I appreciate that very, very much.    In fairness, I think that Chancellor Merkel has actually been leading very forcefully in this and working very, very hard to make sanctions happen at times where others in Europe were not quite as prepared to hold the line, take the measures. So I think that Germany's leadership, France's engagement with Germany and leadership has been important.    I think it was important for them to try to see whether or not they could make Minsk meaningful. And they, themselves, took the position that if Putin didn't adhere to it and was not prepared to take the steps of the Minsk, that then there is plan B.    So plan B is really tougher sanctions and additional support to Ukraine. And I think I would not count everybody out in terms of whether or not, as a result of what has happened, they are automatically against the provision of some defensive assistance to Ukrainians. But there is not yet clarity to the breach, the total breach with respect to the Minsk effort. The prisoners were exchanged the other day. Some weapons have pulled back. Some battalions are now assembled on the border, not inside. So it is a little unclear, and I think they and we are waiting to see how this unfolds in the next days and hours.    I talked at lunchtime yesterday with the Foreign Minister of Germany, who had just come out of the meeting with the French, the Ukrainians, and the Russians. And it was his sense that they had sort of mapped out a few potential steps over the next few days.    So we are getting to that critical decision time, Congressman. The President has a number of options that he is asking his team to evaluate, and he will make the appropriate decision, together with discussions with Chancellor Merkel. In fact, he may well have talked to Chancellor Merkel today or yesterday.    Secretary Kerry. Right.    Secretary Kerry. Well, it is still going to remain the largest exchange program between the United States and any country in the world. The academic year last year had about 710 total participants, 350 Americans, 360 Germans. And the funding has been a pretty level $4 million.    The reduction, in our judgment, would allow us to meet some other high priority demands for exchanges that we are having to support. One is like Ukraine, for instance. We are trying to get Ukrainians to be part of it. We are trying to bolster our networks in the entire periphery around that region. So whether it is Georgia, Moldova, or the Baltics, other countries, we want them to be able to participate. So it is really trying to allocate according to priority and available resources.    Now, if you want to help us and plus it up a little bit, there is nothing we would like more than to keep it at the same level. But this is where I am talking about robbing Peter to pay Paul. All those are virtuous and important efforts, and I think you can see that.    If you can get some students out of each of those other places and it makes a difference in the long-term capacity building of those countries and their outlooks, that is spreading the wealth a little more. And as I say, the German program will still remain the largest program we have.    Secretary Kerry. We hope so, Congresswoman. I mean, that was the purpose of these reforms, as you know. The effort is to try to be able to deliver more faster with greater local buy-in. It increases our reach and it increases the cost savings.    Now, the proof will be in what happens. I mean, right now it can take from 4 to 6 months to buy and deliver U.S. products. And we know there was a certain upheaval here about this. But if you allow more cash-based activities, then USAID's food programs could become much faster, much more nimble, much more responsive, and it actually helps to build some capacity and infrastructure in the communities you are trying to create a sustainable cycle for. So we think it is the right direction to move in, and it allows us to reach 2 million more beneficiaries, about 25 percent increase.    Secretary Kerry. Well, I mean, we evaluate it in every single country and every program where we are. I am not aware that there has been a specific complaint that something is lacking or missing in that effort. Is there something specific that you are----    Secretary Kerry. I understand.    Secretary Kerry. Well, let me do this. I haven't had that specific conversation, frankly. Let me investigate that. And, of course, I have a----    Secretary Kerry. I am not taking it personally actually. I remember this debate when I was up here. I just want to find out exactly, because I haven't been part of any conversation that has examined some shortfall in it. So let me find out where we are.    Secretary Kerry. We will examine that.    Secretary Kerry. Well, thank you. And thanks for coming. I know you are chairing something. I appreciate it. Thank you.    Secretary Kerry. None. They deserve them. There is none that is unfair. We should ask for all of them. What this administration believes, however, is that the embargo has not produced them and will not produce them. In fact, it is the exact opposite. We believe that if you lift the embargo and engage more thoroughly with Cuba, you have a much higher rate of probability and a much faster set of transformations that can take place. I believe that very strongly, personally. I believed it when I was here in that Senate.    I think we have actually helped repression by shutting it down. It is much easier for regimes that are not held accountable, that don't interact with the world, that sort of are shut off to be repressive than places that have been opened up where there is engagement and countries are involved and families----    Secretary Kerry. Go ahead.    Secretary Kerry. Well, first of all, we don't know that they are currently engaging in international terrorism. That evaluation is being made.    Secretary Kerry. Yes.    Secretary Kerry. I am aware of that. But the standard by which you all wrote the law with respect to what has to be measured for international terrorism is whether or not they have engaged in acts of international terrorism in the last 6 months.    Secretary Kerry. Well, this is all being evaluated right now.    Secretary Kerry. I don't know who----    Secretary Kerry. I don't know yet, I am not going to prequalify what is being appropriately judged with the input of all of our Intel Community. All the relevant agencies are asked to contribute to this. You will be well, obviously, advised and briefed with respect to what the conclusions are on it. And I don't know what they are yet because they are engaged in that endeavor. That is a prerequisite, obviously, for the ability to move forward.    But that said, let me just say to you that we are well aware of the Ladies in White and the challenges internally. Actually, I interpret that as sort of a reaction to, it is a manifestation of the fear that might come. But I think there is a much greater opportunity to be able to hold them accountable and deal with that when you have the scrutiny that will come with additional transactions, commerce, presents, money in hands of people there, people traveling, open up standards that come with this. And there is a much greater ability.    I mean, that is how we have operated in many other countries. I mean, Richard Nixon opened up and normalized our relations with China. We still have huge disagreements with China. We normalized and opened up our relations with the Soviet Union. We had huge years during the Cold War where we were fighting them in a cold war. But we were able to do more as a consequence of that engagement. And ultimately, both changed. One disappeared, the Soviet Union, and the other has been increasingly partnering, opening up, engaging in different ways, even as we continue to have some problems.    So these things don't change overnight, and I don't expect that will, nor do you. The question is, are you better positioned to be able to fight for the things that matter to you? Can you leverage people's rights? Can you send an ambassador in to raise the profile on a particular human rights challenge? Can you do more to be able to do that?    We have not backed off of one of those priorities. And, in fact, when Roberta Jacobson, Assistant Secretary Jacobson was there, she met with civil society. They didn't like it, but she met with them.    And so we will continue to press our case, but we also think we are far more advantaged in doing so if we are having diplomatic relations and engaging and opening up so that a lot of folks from Florida, from New Jersey, from other places who have family there would be free to visit, bring ideas, bring their openness, bring their money and other things, which will change life in Cuba. I have no doubt about it.    Secretary Kerry. Please, don't put words in my mouth. I didn't say----    Secretary Kerry. I did. I mentioned China as a country with whom we have normalized diplomatic relations----    Secretary Kerry . And huge differences, is what I said, huge differences, both on a political system, on human rights, on business practices, cyber. Run the list.    Secretary Kerry. But we have diplomatic relations.    Secretary Kerry. Let me answer both of those. First of all, the negotiations regarding with Cuba right now are really fairly straightforward regarding diplomatic relations. It is a process of diplomacy, an automatic process regarding normalization. The parameters of that were negotiated originally, which involved the release of the prisoners. There is obviously a concern about anybody who may have been rearrested or even the Ladies in White. That issue will be raised for certain.    In addition, the Internet agreement and other components of what was already agreed on will be on the table. But the most important part of this now is really the pro forma stuff of diplomatic relations, visas, travel, the access and process by which your diplomats are going to be treated. That is sort of the hard stuff of diplomatic relations and that is what is being talked about right now.    With respect to Venezuela and Cuba, I will tell you that I talked to President--I actually shouldn't--the President of a Latin American country to tell him that we were engaging in this policy. And there was almost a whoop of excitement on the other side of the phone saying, wow, that can really help change things throughout Latin America. If America can begin to have a different relationship with Cuba, it will change what has been a tool, a weapon that has been used against us by other countries in Latin America. And so, in fact, this President thought that he was going to undertake to call President Maduro immediately and talk to him and say, hey, don't get left behind, look what is happening, be part of the future.    Now, that hasn't happened yet, and we have serious concerns about what is going on in Venezuela. And obviously we are sort of perplexed by the and frustrated by the frequency with which President Maduro seems to want to blame everything on us when we have, in fact, done nothing. And every time he is in political trouble he tries to play the anti-American card and starts citing some mythical coup or something that isn't taking place.    It would be great if he could realize the benefits to the people of Venezuela. The people of Venezuela are currently being hurt by the policies that he is pursuing, and we hope that he will realize that we are ready to engage in normal relationship of nations and become engaged in helping to deal with the problems of his people, the poverty, the opportunity, the education that is needed, other things, if he wants to engage in a legitimate relationship.    But there is no doubt that this was well received throughout Latin America. Quite surprised by many countries. Very welcomed by all.    Secretary Kerry. Except, perhaps, Venezuela that may be highly unsettled by it because it sort of leaves them quite isolated.    Secretary Kerry. Thank you, Congressman. I appreciate it.    Secretary Kerry. Well, Rabbi Saperstein is as distinguished an advocate as there is, and he has access to me any time. I mean, I have enormous respect for him. He knows that. I worked very hard to get him to be able to come in and take this job on. And the last thing he is going to suffer for is lack of access to me, I assure you.    This is a huge priority within the State Department. I also appointed the first faith-based liaison office with Shaun Casey filling that role. We are deeply involved in trying to pull interfaith efforts together in order to appropriately stand up for religious freedom, but also to harness the full measure of force that comes from leaders within various religions to start speaking out about the true Islam, about interfaith abilities and needs, and so forth.    So I am very excited about it. The position has existed under prior administrations, but I think everybody would agree that Rabbi Saperstein is hugely appropriate to this moment. And I expect nothing but good results.    Secretary Kerry. Well, it is at the center of the struggle we are involved in.    Secretary Kerry. And we all need to pay attention to that.    Secretary Kerry. Well, first, let me begin, Congressman, I want to thank you for your service. I really appreciate, like everybody does, anybody who puts on the uniform and spends a few years.    Secretary Kerry. As a pilot since I was in college, only out of currency since I have been Secretary of State, I agree with you.    Let me just say to you that you raise two issues there. Is there any issue where they have worked with us? Well, they are working with us on this right now. They put the interim agreement in place over a year ago now. I think it was around November we cut the treaty--the deal, not a treaty. So it has been more than a year. They have done everything they said they would do in the context of that.    They have also kept secret those things that we thought needed to be kept secret as we worked through what could be a final agreement. I mean, we operate under the rule nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. And that means that whatever we may have agreed over here we have got to keep, because it may require one or the other to say yes to something that may not be very popular back home, but may be defensible. But it isn't defensible until you have the whole agreement.    They have not burned us with respect to that, nor we them, and that has facilitated a kind of dialogue that is pretty direct and open and allows us now to bear down on some of these things. They recognize we have difficulties. We recognize they have difficulties. And we all have bottom lines. That is in any negotiation.    So the interim agreement is one example of trying to work together on something. Now there are some things they have done that help us, but we are not coordinating with them. We are not working on it. We haven't asked them to do it. But, for instance, fighting ISIL. They are totally opposed to ISIL, and they are, in fact, taking on and fighting and eliminating ISIL members along the Iraqi border near Iran and have serious concerns about what that would do to the region and so forth. So we have, at least, a mutual interest, if not a cooperative effort.    But in the end, I emphasize to you, your second question was how to reconcile the damage that they may have done or that they could do to Israel in this. That is making a presumption, if you don't mind my saying so, that we are not going to have a deal here that, in our judgment, will absolutely protect Israel. It is not just Israel, by the way. It is us. It is every country in the region.    And it is not just us at the table trying to do this. People need to focus on this. Russia is as adamant as we are that Iran cannot engage in proliferation activities. China is at the table. China has been helpful in this process, as has Russia, by the way. Even in the midst of the fight over Ukraine, Russia is working to help hold Iran accountable and get a favorable agreement, as is China. And then we have Germany, France, Great Britain, all at the table, all as equally concerned about where this goes.    Then you have all the countries in the region, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Emiratis, Kuwaitis, Jordanians, they all have a stake in this.    So we are not flying by the seat of our pants, nor are we proceeding in a solo basis here. And everybody understands the implications of the potential of their having a nuclear weapon. Israel is not the only country. Others worry about it. So they all want to see that we are trying to negotiate an agreement which will meet a high standard of accountability and eliminate the four pathways to a bomb: the Natanz pathway, the Iraq pathway, the Fordow pathway, and then, of course, the potential of a covert pathway.    Now, that is complicated. We have to proceed. But you have to, also, measure this--I say carefully--against alternatives. Presumptions may be being made here by some people that there is an alternative way that you somehow get them to--you know, it is like ``Men in Black,'' you can hold up a little flash pen and flash it and they will forget everything they have learned about fuel cycle or nuclear weapons or nuclear production, peaceful nuclear production.    Do you think that is going to happen? Is there any notion of reality in anybody's mind that says that we are going to negotiate a deal where they have eliminated all of their know-how? And if you don't have verification and if you don't have insight as to what they are doing, there is a greater likelihood they dig deeper under a mountain and do something that you don't know and you wake up one day and, boom, they do have something.    So you have got to ask yourselves what are the real alternatives here. I hear people talk about dismantlement. I mentioned the Bush administration from 2003 on where their deal was no enrichment. But they just enriched away, and they centrifuged away, and they went from 164 to 19,000. They did that while they had sanctions, while there was a prohibition on the policy, while there was a U.N. resolution. And so you have got to stop and say, what is the best way to be able to guarantee they don't get a bomb for the period of time to build in the future as we begin to change a lot of other things, hopefully?    Now, I will tell you this. I am not going to go into all of it now. I want us to see if we have a deal before I put all the arguments out there. But I am telling you there are many more arguments than have been heard about why this is important, and there are many more arguments than you will probably hear next week. And we need to wait and see what deal we have before you can really measure what it is that is at stake here and what the options are and how you feel about it.    Secretary Kerry. Well, I really want to engage in that discussion with everybody. Russia today can be heard in English. Do we have an equivalent that can be heard in Russian? That is a pretty expensive proposition.    They are spending huge amounts of money with speaking languages that other people understand and putting out information that other people understand in other countries around them, and we are not. We are beginning now to do this with respect to ISIL, and so we are putting out things in Urdo, we are putting out things in Somalia, we are putting out things in Arabic.    But this is a big enterprise, folks. I am all for it. The President is all for it. But it takes money. And we have got to be prepared to invest in sort of that kind of marketing, if you will, and the penetration. What we have allocated now under BBG goes to Radio Free Asia, it goes to TV Marti, it goes to all these various entities, it is split up, while the real challenge is not as much there, to be honest with you, as it is in some of these other places.    So we will all agree we ought to sit down and rethink it, recommit, figure out how we are going to do this most effectively. We haven't cornered the market on the wisdom of that. But you are right, Andy Lack is a very capable guy. We are hopeful that we are going to have a rejuvenation of that effort. And we are sure to come back to you and talk to you about some of the ways we could try to augment our initiatives.    Secretary Kerry. Very talented guy.    Secretary Kerry. I will tell you what, I will commit to come to you with a program that will lay out, together with all of those folks you have just named, a stronger approach on this, and I hope we can have a meeting of the minds on it.    Madam Chairwoman, with your indulgence, can I just say that we remain as deeply committed now as I was in the very beginning to trying to work something between the Palestinians and Israelis. It has been made very, very difficult by virtue of the Palestinian accession to the ICC, which we strongly advised them not to do and said would be acting against their own interests and the interests of a long-term resolution.    As everybody knows, there is a critical election in Israel in the next weeks. We are assiduously not engaged and do not want to get in the middle of that. It is up to the people of Israel to make their own decision. Our hope is, however, that when that decision is made and a government comes together, we will have an opportunity to get back to the real work of peace and of finding a road forward.    And the United States is deeply committed to that as before, and we are working right now to help make sure the Palestinian Authority doesn't collapse because of the lack of revenues and the stress that they are under. But make no mistake, that remains a major priority of many nations in the region, and I hear it wherever I go.    Secretary Kerry. Thank you so much.
