    Mr. O'CARROLL. Good morning, Chairman Boustany, Ranking Member Doggett, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the invitation to testify.    Last September, police in Richmond, Virginia, issued an arrest warrant for a man who had committed serious crimes. The suspect was wanted for, amongst other crimes, carjacking, using a firearm to commit a felony, and malicious wounding. Within weeks, a U.S. Marshal's fugitive task force, along with OIG special agents, located and arrested the man in Virginia.    Because this fugitive received SSI payments, the task force found him with an assist of our Fugitive Enforcement Program. Through information sharing and collaboration with law enforcement agencies across the country, this program has helped bring thousands of fugitives to justice.    In the past, SSA would have suspended this fugitive's SSI payments based on the felony arrest warrant from Richmond. But since he was wanted for carjacking rather than for fleeing justice, SSA could not take action to stop his payments until he was behind bars.    For many years, we have worked with local law enforcement to locate fugitive felons and help SSA cut off their payments. However, since 2009, two court decisions have dramatically limited SSA's ability to stop these payments. I discuss these decisions further in my written testimony, but they essentially stopped SSA from suspending payments unless someone is wanted specifically for flight or escape.    As I said, the effect has been dramatic. In 2009, SSA suspended benefits for more than 58,000 individuals. In 2014, after the court decisions, SSA suspended benefits for 830 individuals. The court decisions did not affect our ability to share locator information with law enforcement. And we continue to help those agencies in their efforts to apprehend fugitives.    Your subcommittee, with support from the Subcommittee on Social Security, recently introduced the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act. This law would again discontinue payments to individuals who are the subject of an outstanding felony arrest warrant.    The Social Security Act also prohibits payments to prisoners, and we have a long history of overseeing and improving the agency's efforts in this area. Some of our earliest audit work recommended that SSA improve collection of prisoner information and pursue agreements to obtain this information.    Because of our work, SSA now has agreements to obtain prisoner data from 50 States, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and thousands of local corrections facilities. SSA matches this inmate data against its payment records every month to make sure that prisoners don't receive a check. SSA estimates that it suspends benefits to about 60,000 prisoners each year, saving about $500 million per year. This success story is a good example of the potential that data matches for ensuring that SSA payment accuracy.    For many years, my office has recommended these matches to SSA. For example, we work with Homeland Security to match Customs travel data to SSA records, an estimated $150 million in overpayments to SSI recipients based on their absence from the United States for more than 30 days.    And as your subcommittee knows, we recently reviewed SSA's process for removing self-employment earnings from SSI recipient records and notifying the IRS of this discrepancy. We recommended that SSA work with the IRS to identify earned income tax credit fraud.    Unfortunately, we in SSA are limited in our ability to secure data matches under the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act. We have proposed an exemption from the CMPPA only for data matches intended to identify fraud and waste. One current House proposal, the Inspector General Empowerment Act, includes this exemption.    In conclusion, SSI payment accuracy is a high priority for my office. The program is a critical safety net for the most vulnerable citizens in our society. We must also not forget that we are accountable to the taxpayers who fund this program to ensure that only those who are eligible can receive these payments.    I appreciate your interest in improving the integrity of the SSI program. We look forward to collaborating with your subcommittee on the best ways to do this effectively. Thank you again for the invitation to testify, and I will be happy to answer any questions.    Mr. O'CARROLL. Yes, Chairman. One of the things that I mentioned in my testimony is the legislation on allowing IGs to be exempt from the Computer Matching Act.    And the reasoning behind it is pretty much as we were talking before with identity theft, that, in government databases, we know and have a lot of identifying information about individuals that the agencies can share with each other, which would identify who the person is and make sure that the right person is getting the right benefits.    So, in that regard, that would be--one of the bills is the IG Empowerment Act. But of the bills that are being proposed by this committee here, all of them--the Fraud Act, the CUFF Act--each of those are going after the facilitators, the organized groups that are going out there trying to defraud us.    I think that is a major step in the right direction and then making sure that the people that are fleeing from us aren't going out there doing more crimes while we are still giving them checks.    Mr. O'CARROLL. Yes, Congresswoman. That kind of falls under the Computer Matching Act. The purpose of that act when it was initially passed was that it was for the privacy of the citizen. And they were feeling that, if government was using all this information that they had, that it would be used unfairly towards the citizenry.    But what we are saying is that we would like the exemptions for that to be done on antifraud initiatives, not for blanket information on citizens, but just to be able to compare that information. And most of it is against the batches.    So, as an example, we can do one-on-one queries of other agency databases, but when we get into doing it in batch form, all we can use it for is audits. We can't use it for antifraud initiatives. We can't use it for that.    Mr. O'CARROLL. So that is why we are asking for the exemption for not only the IG, but also for the agency to be able to use it for antifraud and abuse.    Mr. O'CARROLL. Congresswoman, that bill--well, in 1996, the bill was passed that fleeing felons wouldn't be able to receive benefits. That was for the SSI program. And then, in 2005, it was applied to all of SSA's programs. So it would be, also, the other programs of SSA. And then, in 2009, what happened was there were several court decisions.    The court decisions were basically saying that the terminology of the bill was ``fleeing felons,'' and the belief was that, if a person was not fleeing, that they would not be liable to having their benefits cut off. And so that one, which is called the Martinez settlement, went into effect.    And then, at that point there, just to give you a little bit of idea of the sizing it, we were talking about 50,000 people were ineligible up until Martinez. And then, at that point, we are at about 800--well, we had identified about 50,000 people that were ineligible. And now, with all the different constraints that are put on it in relation to fleeing, we are down to about 800.    Mr. O'CARROLL. Yeah. We were talking--let me think. I have that somewhere right here in front of me.    Congresswoman, let me get back to you on that. I should have it right here.    Mr. O'CARROLL. I do have it in front of me right now.    We were talking improper payments of about--$321 million was our original audit, and it has gone down to about $14 million.    Mr. O'CARROLL. Yes. We not only support it, but we have helped on some of the technical work on developing it.    Mr. O'CARROLL. Congressman, one of the things you were talking about was the earned income tax credits as an example.    Just to give you an example of where computer matching would help, you have the Department of Treasury that sends out the check for the earned income tax credit, which is the same one that is sending out the benefit checks for Social Security on it, and they don't match the two. And when----    Mr. O'CARROLL. But, again, since it is two benefit programs, they are not allowed to match on that one. It gets very complicated.    Another one is that Department of Labor can be giving government unemployment benefits to a person and then SSA at the same time will be giving them disability payments on it where the two agencies aren't matching again.    Mr. O'CARROLL. Congressman Davis, I will take a first crack at that.    Yes. We have improper payments, and a big portion of improper payments can be accidental, can be because of laws, rules, whatever, that makes that money go out before it is validated. And then, you know, it is very difficult to bring back.    Our biggest concern and one of the things that we have been trying to do is to assess what part is fraud and what part is just straight improper payment, accidental, intentional, or whatever. It is very difficult.    And Chairman Johnson on the Subcommittee for Social Security has asked us to try to size the amount of fraud in SSA, and we have taken attempts for it. It is very difficult. We are in the process of doing it now. We would be one of the first government agencies to do it because it is so difficult to show.    I guess the one thing I try to remind everybody is, although fraud is a very small percentage of the improper payments, when you are dealing with billions of dollars in terms of payments, it is still a very high number and it outrages the public.    Mr. O'CARROLL. Yes, Congressman. As was mentioned before, is that we are in favor of, you know the CUFF Act, we assisted on that. One of the things that I wanted to correct, too, was when I was asked by Congresswoman Noem on the dollars of it, was that at the time of 2009, when they kicked in with Martinez, there was about $500 million in savings on it. And since that act, it has been reduced by about two-thirds of that. I just wanted to correct what I had said before and my numbers on that. Anyway, in terms of the other acts, the Fraud Act is one that we are particularly interested in because it is going after the facilitators, it is going after those people that make a business out of stealing money from the Government and facilitating other people to do it, and making sure that, you know, one, when they are caught, they are going to be sentenced correctly, and, two, that the money is going to be brought back to the Government. So of all the acts, that and the CUFF Act would be the two I am most familiar with.
