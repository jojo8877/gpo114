    Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Just on two aspects of this. One is the nature of terrorist attacks has changed profoundly. Al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has relied traditionally on complex plots involving explosions in airliners. Now, in September 2014, an ISIS leader told would-be recruits not to bother coming to Iraq or Syria but to launch attacks in their home countries. ISIS has called for attacks on soft targets in the West by any means available, including using a car to drive at pedestrians.    The other issue is technology. As Mr. Steinbach had said, technology moves faster than legislation, a lot faster. You characterize the FBI as labeling this, you know, ``going dark.'' It is increasingly difficult to monitor the communications within terrorist networks. The proliferation of often encrypted, covert, coded information to prevent unauthorized use, from Skype to gaming forums to other new technology, has made surveillance tremendously technologically demanding, and in some cases, virtually impossible.    Moreover, Apple's latest mobile operating system came with a default encryption, and Google's Android is soon to follow. In these systems, companies do not have access to their customers' passwords, and thus can't capture their messages.    Now from a customer standpoint, from a consumer standpoint, you know, that is a very good thing. But those who are malicious--those--the malignancy of terror--it takes away a major tool that law enforcement uses to thwart terrorist activity in its planning stages.    So, could you comment on that and what it is, if anything, we can be doing? You know, there was a time where publicly-owned telephone companies were all too willing to cooperate with law enforcement agencies for wiretaps and those kinds of things. That is no longer the case, and this poses a major, major challenge to Western law enforcement officials.
