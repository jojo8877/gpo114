    Mr. Flores. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you and also Ranking Member Rush for hosting this hearing today. I also want to thank each of you for your testimony. Given the timing and how little time we have left to vote, I am going to commend each of you for the jobs that you have done. I commend you for the quality of your testimony. Mr. Wilson, all I can say is wow. What an awesome piece of testimony. Ms. Martinez, thank you for what you are doing.    I think given the lack of time we have, I will just submit my questions in writing. Thank you.
