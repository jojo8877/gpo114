    Mr. Hudson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank the panel for being here today, a very informative discussion.    Mr. McGuire, which of your appliances have been regulated multiple times? I mean, do you believe we are reaching a point of diminishing marginal returns with this serial rulemaking?    Mr. Hudson. I appreciate that. Mr. Long asked one of the other panelists about the issue of having the DOE propose new standards for some products while the underlying test procedures are also changing, would you like to elaborate on how this is a problem for you?    Mr. Hudson. Well that seems like it is not serving the best interest of the people either if we aren't getting the true assessment of the as a result of these tests. I obviously see why that is a mistake.    Many of your manufacturers made several regulated products and face multiple rules. What is the challenge, maybe you can elaborate a little more it for your member companies in terms of complying with all these different requirements simultaneously, just in addition to the testing things we talked about but just elaborate on that?    Mr. Hudson. Thank you. Industry groups have repeatedly asked DOE to establish separate product categories for condensing and noncondensing covered products only to have DOE provide response that condensing and noncondensing equipment provide the same utility to consumers so there is no justification for establishing separate product categories. Is this another area that warrants an objective third-party review?    Mr. Hudson. I appreciate that.    And Mr. Chairman, it looks like my time is about expired, so I will yield back.
