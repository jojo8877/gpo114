    Mr. Bera. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and ranking member. And I thank the panelists as well.    I am going to reserve judgment on a final deal until we actually see what is in that final deal. But my starting point and my concern is, I don't trust Iran. Right? In any final deal, verification has to be the starting point. I just don't know how you verify if you don't have unfettered access to places.    And, again, if you don't have that verification, as the chairman stated, there should be no signing bonus, right? I mean, you don't get a bonus just for signing the deal. You get a bonus after adhering to the terms of the deal, verifying that, and then over time perhaps you can gain trust. And that is what has me concerned.    I also have very legitimate concerns that as Iran's economy strengthens, what they do with that strength in terms of--many of the members, the ranking member and the chairman, have talked about the funding of terrorism, the funding of Hamas and Hezbollah, and that is a real concern. If we look at the nature of the Middle East and how things are changing dramatically, you can see a scenario where a revitalized Iran, a Shia-dominated Iraq, an Assad who stays in place, Hezbollah and Hamas creating this ring around our allies. And even without nuclear weapons, we see a very unstable Middle East, where I would never have thought that Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, the unlikeliest of allies, might actually ally against a common threat.    I certainly would be curious about this scenario, even without acquiring nuclear weapons, what a revitalized Iranian economy would look like and how they would use those.    Maybe, Mr. Rademaker, if you would like to.    Mr. Bera. Dr. Pollack, would you like to?    Mr. Bera. Thank you, Dr. Pollack.
