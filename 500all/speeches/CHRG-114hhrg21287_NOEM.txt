    Mrs. NOEM. Thank you. Mr. Wilson, I was reading your testimony. I was struck by your description of a lot of your significant challenges that you've faced in Florida, and especially as it relates to generational poverty. Because although the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that South Dakota has the second lowest unemployment rate in the nation, at 2.9 percent, we still have portions of the state that live in generational poverty. And some of the challenges that you specifically discussed had to do with housing and access to transportation. And those are some of the basic needs that we face as well.    Some of these areas, you know, obviously, are in a situation where they're quite remote and rural areas, which might be a little different than what you've faced, but I'd like you to expand a little bit on some of the solutions that you pursued that might be useful not just in urban areas but also rural areas, on addressing those challenges. And also building the relationships to help lift people out of generational poverty. That's definitely what we see programs doing in the parts of our state that are dealing with high unemployment rates. Some of my tribes, where they're located, have been in 80 to 90 percent unemployment rates for generations.    Mrs. NOEM. And it's become the norm, and not--and the state is looking for solutions. I'm looking for solutions, on how we can build relationships between the private sector and programs that already exist, to change them so that they truly do lift people out of these situations. Could you give some more feedback on things that have worked?    Mrs. NOEM. So do we need the flexibility for each individual situation? So we have to look at that individual that is on programs today, what would address their situation? And then at that point, does the program need to be flexible at the state level, for the state to address? Because it's very hard for us in Washington, D.C. to decide how a program should function. I think that's where we see the restrictions that don't allow it to be formulated in a manner that can be fixed for each individual situation.    Mrs. NOEM. Did you base that off of annual income? How did you----    Mrs. NOEM . Qualify?    Mrs. NOEM. Okay.    Mrs. NOEM. Any other examples you could give us of extremely successful programs that you feel like would really work? And not just in urban areas. I'm thinking immediately about your tax credit solution for school choice would be difficult in a rural area, where the only school they might have access to is, within 20 miles, is that school. But beyond that, for that flexibility in a program, that would work in a rural area as well, is there one that comes to the top of your mind that might work?    Mrs. NOEM. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
