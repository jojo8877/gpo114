    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I have for the record a report that I would like to enter from Cardinal Peter Turkson, President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.    The Chairman. Without objection.    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. I want to read a portion of that, and then I will ask my question. He says, ``hunger in the world is a very serious injustice that shows fundamental disrespect for human dignity. Pope John Paul II called it the first and fundamental form of poverty. Persistent hunger, starvation, and malnutrition represent a global failure of humanity that, to our shame, has dragged on for decades. It is a plague and a long-term indicator of a system that does not function properly. Some point to the economic crisis of recent years as the reason why the world cannot do better, but that is just an excuse. Food insecurity has persisted for decades through prosperous times as well as more difficult times.''    And the panel, I want to explain to you. I represent the Navajo Nation in Arizona where household food insecurity is above 75 percent. And so my question is, do you think it is possible to feed a world population of over nine billion people without the use of genetic engineering and the full use of agricultural technology? And I will just open that up to the panel, whoever wants to address that.    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Anyone else on the panel want to comment?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Anyone else?    Mrs. Kirkpatrick. Thank you very much. I appreciate the testimony that you are giving us today, and I yield back.    The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady. Mr. Benishek, for 5 minutes.
