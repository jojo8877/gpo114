    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Madam Chair, and welcome to our guests, and I believe that the information exchanged here is very critical, and it's important to protect taxpayer information. I think that we all bear that sort of responsibility and goal, and I thank you for the information again.    Can I just get a better sense of the IT budget for perhaps the last five years or so from 2010? Has it been flat? Has there been a decrease, increase? What basically are we talking about in numbers here?    Mr. Tonko. So the efforts here to go forward I would think some of it is a function of having resources essential to address some of the dynamics perhaps a pay scale differential with the private sector to compete for the talent. Can we talk about that for a bit, your efforts with a skilled cybersecurity workforce? How do you address the whole impact of strengthening that given that the private sector may have that pay differential?    Mr. Tonko. And in the last 5 or six years you've had to make up a decline in revenues, resources with the shot that you got, the one shot you got last year, but that must have impacted somehow addressing the differential.    Mr. Tonko. And so other than the workforce issue, what are those reforms or those improvements? Where do we need to reach? What are the tools in the toolkit that are required to provide for taxpayer protection here?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you very much. I have used up my available time, but I appreciate the efforts that are being made. And again, bearing in mind that taxpayer protection should be the guiding force, I appreciate the response to the questions here.    And with that, I yield back, Madam Chair.    Chairwoman Comstock. Thank you.    And I now recognize Mr. Lucas for five minutes.
