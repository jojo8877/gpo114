    Mr. Olson. I thank the Chair. And welcome to our witnesses. Ms. Self, Mr. Malta, Ms. Ranieri, and certainly no disrespect, but can I call you Professor G? Is that OK, because----    Mr. Olson . If I try pronouncing it with my thick Texas tongue, I am going to be exposing myself to a lawsuit for cruel and unusual punishment. All people here watching on TV, so Professor G is OK? Great.    My first question for all the panelists, and starting off with you, Professor G, as you know, there are 18 States right now that have State laws that fight abusive patent letter demands. The lovely State of Texas is one of the 32 that doesn't have those such laws, but they are being authored right now and this issue is on the table. And so they are in session for 140 days every 2 years, so it is a brief window of time here. So put your cowboy hat on and come to Texas. How would you best like me to advise the people there what should they do, what should they not do if Texas steps out and does--some laws fighting abuse patent demand letters? Yes.    Mr. Olson. OK. Thank you.    Mr. Olson. Ms. Self, can you comment? Anything you can advise our legislature?    Mr. Olson. Expected. You guys are great. That was expected.    Mr. Olson. Yes.    Mr. Olson. Thank you. And, Mr. Malta, no intention to put you between two different people on different sides of the issue, but you are right there, my friend. How about your comments? What can I take back home?    Mr. Olson. Well, that is easy----    Mr. Olson. OK. And, Ms. Ranieri, your comments on Texas? Get 'er done, is that--do you echo those comments?    Mr. Olson. I am out of time. Thank you.    Yield back.
