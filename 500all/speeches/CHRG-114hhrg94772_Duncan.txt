    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just real quick, I think what I hear and what I read is that wildfire and invasive species are the largest threat. But it seems like the environmentalist movement is wanting to threaten the development of energy, oil and gas, in the sage grouse region. I have concern about that. How do we address that wildfire and invasive species ought to be the focus.    I don't have a dog in the fight. I am going to yield my time to the gentleman from Montana, Mr. Zinke.    Mr. Duncan. I yield back.    The Chairman. Thank you.    Mr. Grijalva.
