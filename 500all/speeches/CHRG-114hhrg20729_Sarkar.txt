    Mr. Sarkar. Reuben Sarkar. Thank you for the question. Just to build on what Dr. Orr had said, within DOE and within the transportation sector, we do not exactly have a program called Smart Cities, per se. Smart Cities is the vernacular that is used by a number of agencies to describe data-driven cities, and the ways that we can use controls and information to make cities more efficient.    What we do have is a Smart Mobility program that is going to be part of our Transportation as a System program, and builds on our component level of research which looks at the efficiency of an individual vehicle and takes it up to the level of how do we make future mobility systems more efficient when we think about things like connected and automated vehicles, a multimodal transportation, and the convergence of IT systems into cars.    And so our Smart Mobility program is a multi-lab consortia, part of our Transportation as a System program, and it is very complementary to the work that is being done by other agencies, like DLT and their Smart Cities challenge, but it looks very specifically at how do we optimize the energy benefits that we get when we look at all of these future mobility systems, these new business models that are coming, both in the movement of goods, and, as well, in the movement of people.    Mr. Sarkar. Yes. So we do both joint program briefings in which DOT comes and briefs us on their efforts and then we brief them on ours. We also recently hired a lab M&O contractor from the National Renewable Energy Lab from DOE and we embedded them with DOT on their Smart Cities team. And we use that person as the liaison to make sure that we are coordinating our activities and that what we are investing in is a very high value to what DOT is investing in.    Mr. Sarkar. Thanks.    Mr. Sarkar. Yes. In our bioenergy program, we have included both municipal solid waste as well as wet waste streams as part of our feed stocks that we are having for our next-generation pilot and demonstration programs that will be coming soon. And so we have bio solids to bio power represented in the next pilot and demonstration programs.    Mr. Sarkar. Yes. And maybe, just so I can clarify, our integrated bio refinery program, which is part of our demonstration and market transformation program, we will be conducting both pilot and demonstration-scale plants, so taking things from lower-scale, less integration, and moving them up into larger-scale facilities.    And the goal is that demonstrating at a higher scale will then lower the technical risk and will provide access to more bank financing or financing through the loans program. And our goal is that once you demonstrate the lower risk of a technology and the viability, then you are able to then replicate those plants at others.    Mr. Sarkar. Within the bioenergy program, we fund only up through the demonstration-scale facilities and not all the way into the commercialization phase for plants. I can follow up and get you a more clear answer.    Mr. Sarkar. Yes, I will just build on it a little bit. As mentioned, hydrogen builds on an electrified platform, so there is benefits for electric vehicles as is for hydrogen. We do work in two areas. One, as you mentioned, there is already vehicles on the road, and so we are actually supporting the deployment of those stations in places like California. Through our H2USA public-private partnership, we have about 45 companies and agencies involved in developing the expeditious process for rolling out those stations in places like California, first on examples, working on safety codes and standards, trying to get standard reference designs for stations. We have developed equipment that can qualify stations very quickly and enable us to actually deploy those hundred planned stations much more rapidly. Then on the research side, we continue to drive down the cost of fuel cell systems on vehicles by lowering the amount of precious metal catalysts and things that we have onboard the vehicle, and at the same time, lowering the cost to store hydrogen off the vehicle at stations.    Then lastly, the biggest nut that we are working on cracking is renewable hydrogen from advanced sources. We already can make renewable hydrogen from solar and wind today, and if we can push down the cost further through advanced water-splitting technologies, you have an opportunity to really deeply decarbonize transportation, and so we work on it both on the deployment side with the cars today as well as on the long-term research side.    Mr. Sarkar. Rueben Sarkar, yes, through our Clean Cities program and through our national Clean Fleet partnerships, where we have partnered with a number of large corporations like Frito-Lay, Coca-Cola, and others, we have seen a considerable amount of natural gas deployment and have done a number of case studies to demonstrate the benefits of natural gas deployment. I don't have the exact numbers offhand, but we do track how much natural gas penetration we have had through our efforts, and how much petroleum displacement we have achieved. And we continue to do a lot of activity on the deployment side of the equation. We also do a lot of research and demonstration on the dual fuel side in the Class A truck space to see where we can displace additional diesel through implementation of dual fuel technologies as well.    Mr. Sarkar. We have not done as much on the deployment side in the public transit sector. That normally goes to DOT. We do provide technical assistance, case studies and information that a lot of people make good decisions about adoption of alternative fuels, but not as much deployment and research on public transit. And then your second part of the question was on----    Mr. Sarkar. Post office. We engage with the post office to advise them on technology adoption as part of their RFP proposals. But we do not direct it. We generally provide them a basis for information, whether it is alternative fuels for electrification or natural gas. But we don't actually fund deployment activities with the U.S. Postal Service.    Mr. Sarkar. I would have to check on that. Normally, we are in an advisory capacity and that the U.S. Postal Service does their own separate RFPs the way it is structured, and all we do is provide assistance and guidance.
