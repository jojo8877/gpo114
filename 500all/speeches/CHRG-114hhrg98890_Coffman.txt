    Mr. Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Well, I have somewhat of a different view. First of all, let me just say thank you all for supporting our military families. I have 21 years combined military service, Active Duty, enlisted, United States Army, infantry officer of the United States Marine Corps, five overseas deployments.    I support these reforms. And I think that they are not going to compromise the benefit for our families. But they are threatening for the people who run the system, and I understand that, and change is always difficult. And so if you--in your opposition, I really strongly suggest and would love to hear more about your ideas to make this system more efficient. We have got to challenge government everywhere. We have got to challenge government to be more--you know, to be able to deliver services more efficiently, and no area of government ought to be immune from that, and so that is my concern. And I challenge you all to do that.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
