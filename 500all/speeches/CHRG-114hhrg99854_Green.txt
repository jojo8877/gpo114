    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Amann, I am glad to see efficiency advocates in industry working side by side. Does the DOE currently support SSL technology?    Mr. Green. Are the SSL technologies as energy-efficient as possible or is there currently room for more improvement?    Mr. Green. Dr. Hakkarainen, do you have a sense as to why SSL was not included?    Mr. Green. Was included in the--DOE indicates here in here in their original NOPR they did not intend to include SSL products.    Mr. Green. OK. In your testimony you make references that the rulemaking could threaten future investments. Would you explain further what costs would be associated with SSL inclusion?    Mr. Green. Is it technically feasible to meet the requirements of the DOE standard?    Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
