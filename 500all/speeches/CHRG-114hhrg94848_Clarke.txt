    Ms. Clarke. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Being the low one on the totem pole, oftentimes, it comes with the territory.    Let me welcome our panelists as well, and pick up on some of the line of questioning that my colleague Mr. Tonko raised with respect to research.    So, Dr. Fauci, your testimony discussed the potential for a universal flu vaccine that could provide protection against numerous strains of the flu over several seasons. What can you tell us about the research on this vaccine?    Ms. Clarke. That sounds very promising, Dr. Fauci.    Dr. Robinson, you mentioned in your testimony a new initiative to support development of new flu vaccine candidates that offer broader, longer-lasting immunity. Can you tell us more about this initiative?    Ms. Clarke. So it sounds like we are moving into the 21st century.    Ms. Clarke. Very well. Very well. I would like to shift a bit to the idea of strains, the strain selection process, Dr. Midthun. Can you outline the role of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee in the strain selection process, and when does this process actually begin?    Ms. Clarke. How does the advisory committee arrive at its recommendations on the selection of a strain?    Ms. Clarke. That is what I was going to ask----    Ms. Clarke . Has there ever been an incident where perhaps the advisory committee did not necessarily agree and the manufacturer is already proceeding?    Ms. Clarke. Yes.    Ms. Clarke. Thank you.
