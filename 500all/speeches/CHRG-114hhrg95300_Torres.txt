    Mrs. Torres. I know.    Mrs. Torres. Anything that gets me closer to you, Chairman, would be a wonderful thing. And thank you for allowing me to come before my colleagues.    My question would be to Mr. Miranda. Do you think that Puerto Rico's territory status is a cause of Puerto Rico's economic and fiscal problems, or just a contributing factor? Or do you think that the issues are totally distinct?    Mrs. Torres. I have one more question, so let me stop you there. My next question would be to Mr. Berrios. I want to make sure I get both of my questions on the record. We can follow up.    Puerto Ricans are leaving the island in huge numbers, and they are immigrating to the states. They are not necessarily leaving to other countries. In light of this, do you believe Puerto Rico's economy would perform better as a sovereign nation, or as a state?    Mrs. Torres. Oh, Berrios.    Mrs. Torres. Disculpa.    Mrs. Torres. As a sovereign nation?    Mrs. Torres. Thank you, sir. I am not here to answer questions, I am here to ask them.
