    Mr. McNerney. I thank the chairman.    And I thank the Commissioners for giving us your wishlist this morning. I think it was an interesting list.    Mr. Chairman, would you update us a little bit on the Commission's efforts to address cybersecurity, specifically coordination with some of the other Federal agencies?    Mr. McNerney. Are you a lead agency in regard to this issue?    Mr. McNerney. Do you think there is a potential that sort of a knee-jerk reaction to the tragic Paris attacks could actually make us less secure, specifically----    Mr. McNerney. Well, I mean some policies that are designed to sound tough but actually cause problems, more problems than they were intended, specifically with cyber and maybe backdoor policies.    Mr. McNerney. Thank you.    Commissioner Clyburn, you mentioned the Mobility Fund hasn't really been implemented yet. Do you see a path forward to that?    Mr. McNerney. Thank you.    Commissioner Rosenworcel, you mentioned the Federal lands for broadband deployment. What is your vision for that?    Mr. McNerney. So the initial phase, then, would be just to identify existing facilities.    Mr. McNerney. OK. Thank you.    Mr. O'Rielly, you mentioned that Federal Government user fees are needed. Would you expand on that a little bit?    Mr. McNerney. Thank you.    I was certainly interested in the comment on high-frequency spectrum, but we will have to put that one off.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
