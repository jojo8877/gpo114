    Mr. Chabot. Okay, I had a different--yeah, that is the one. I just spoke on the floor. I apologize. I just raced over here from speaking on the bill that we are taking up on the floor today. I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my support for H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2015.    Kim Jong-un's regime represents an imminent threat to the global nonproliferation effort, to the global economy, and the global financial system. North Korea has made its intentions clear that it will not halt its nuclear weapons and missile programs. But its trajectory will not last long if the U.S. denies access to its offshore accounts and funding.    As you know, H.R. 757 puts banks everywhere on notice that they must choose between doing business with Kim Jong-un and making use of the U.S. financial system, and that U.S. must maintain a consistent position that makes it crystal clear to the regime in Pyongyang that we will not concede to its unreasonable demands. The time for willful blindness, for looking the other way at North Korea's proliferation, money laundering, and its kleptocracy is over. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure this happens, and hope that the administration pursues a path that will increase security for South Korea and the international community.    And, again, I apologize for getting here at the last minute. But I had to be in two places at once. So I yield back.
