    Mr.  Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Judd, let me kind of go a little different direction here for a moment. You have noted in the past some of the challenges of securing the border on Federal lands.    Specifically, what sort of obstacles do agents face when access is limited, say due to endangered species or wilderness designations?    Mr.  Hice. Mr. Vitiello, a similar type of thought with you regarding Federal lands. You are aware of the permitting delays on Federal lands, whether it is for road maintenance or forward-operating bases or mobile surveillance systems, what have you. What is an acceptable period of time for permitting to take place for your agency before you have lost your tactical advantage?    Mr.  Hice. But at some point, your intel becomes irrelevant if permitting takes so long where you can't--what kind of time frame is reasonable?    Mr.  Hice. Are you receiving cooperation from other agencies?    Mr.  Hice. Okay. Of course, we all know that ISIS is attempting to exploit any and all of our loopholes on our Nation's national security and, in particular, our borders, from infiltrating the refugee program, and so forth.    But when it comes to our borders, how high are the security risks? And how can we mitigate those?    I will begin, Mr. Judd, with you quickly.    Mr.  Hice. Okay.    Mr. Ting?    Mr.  Hice. Okay, let me ask you, Mr. McCraw, how high are the security risks? And how do we mitigate it?
