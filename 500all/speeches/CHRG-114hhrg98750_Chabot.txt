    Chairman CHABOT. The Committee will come to order. Good morning. I am Congressman Steve Chabot. I am the chairman of the House Small Business Committee. We want to thank you all for being with us here today as we discuss manufacturing here in New York City.    Before we get started, I sincerely want to thank our ranking member, Nydia Velazquez, for inviting me to her district to do this field hearing. The two of us have a very unusual relationship that is not seen very often in Washington, D.C. We actually get along and conduct our Committee business in a bipartisan fashion. Time and time again I have been impressed with the tenacity, she has for defending and supporting small businesses, and the commitment she has to fighting for the people of her congressional district. As she has said many times, helping our small businesses grow is not a partisan issue, and we strive to work together in that regard.    I also want to thank our colleague, Greg Meeks, for being here. We have been on the Foreign Affairs Committee a number of years together, and have worked very well. And he has that same attitude also that rather than worrying about the politics of things, he wants to get the job done. And he works extremely hard. We are not the same party, so I am telling you as somebody who has seen these people operate in action, and they do really a great job for their districts. So I want to commend them for that.    We will be joined shortly by Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, and she has that same sort of relationship also in working very hard for her constituents. So I want to thank all of them for their work and the work that we don the Small Business Committee together.    My visit is actually a bit overdue. Back in 2007, Nydia was kind of enough to come and conduct a hearing in my district, which is in Cincinnati, the City of Cincinnati, Ohio. That is right. She was the chairman of this Committee at that time, and I was the ranking member. If your party is in the majority, which Republicans are right now in the House of Representatives, the chairman of the committees or chairwoman of the committees are Republicans, and the ranking member is the lead Democrat on the committee. And if the Democrats are in the majority, which they have been, I was the ranking member, and she was the chair. I like it better the way it is now obviously.    But it all----    Chairman CHABOT. Do not get confident, that is very true. Well, I am very glad to be able to come to Nydia's district to talk about manufacturing here in New York City. While people often envision manufacturers as giant corporations with huge production facilities, the truth is that the vast majority of manufacturing is done by small businesses, by small manufacturers. In fact, 99 percent of all manufacturers are considered by definition small. Generally, below 500 employees is considered in this country as small business, which can be a fairly large entity.    While they might be small businesses, their effect on our economy is enormous. Manufacturers employ over 12 million people all across the country and directly contribute over $2 trillion to our economy each year. We cannot underestimate its indirect influence either. Every dollar spent on manufacturing in America adds $1.37 to the economy. A single manufacturing job can lead to the creation of three to five more jobs in other industries. Without a doubt, manufacturing plays a critical role in America's economic wellbeing.    Manufacturers are increasingly participating in international trade as well. Over the past 25 years, U.S. manufactured goods exports more than quadrupled. In 1990, for example, manufacturers in the United States exported $330 billion in goods. By 2000, that number had more than doubled to over $700 billion in goods, and in 2014 it reached an all-time for the 5th consecutive year of $1.4 trillion in goods, despite slowing global growth.    But we can do better. A topic our Committee has examined extensively is the cost of Federal regulation and how that cost is borne by various segments of the economy. Research has found that manufacturers pay over $19,000 per employee per year on average to comply with Federal regulations, or nearly double the $10,000 per employee per year borne by firms as a whole. Small businesses pay a much higher percentage of their revenues in the cost of regulations than do larger companies. In addition, small manufacturers, those with fewer than 50 employees, spend two and a half times the amount of large manufacturers. We must work together to eliminate unnecessary and burdensome regulations to help unleash the full capacity of the manufacturing engine.    Another challenge going forward is maintaining a skilled workforce. The products we build, the way we build them, and the skills required to do so are different than in generations past. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, over the next decade nearly three and a half million manufacturing jobs will likely be needed, and two million are expected to go unfilled due to a skills gap. We need to enact education policies that prioritize these new trades and make skills training more widespread, more accessible, and more affordable.    Given the importance of manufacturing to our economy, I am delighted to be here with all of you today with my colleagues here in Congress, and I am looking forward to hearing all the witnesses' testimony here this morning. And I would now like to yield to Ms. Velazquez for her opening remarks.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much for your opening statement. We appreciate that very much.    I would now like to recognize the gentleman, Mr. Meeks, for the purpose of making an opening statement if he would like to do so.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. I appreciate your opening statement. And very briefly, I will explain the timing system here. We operate under what is called the 5-minute rule. It is pretty straightforward. It means that each member of the panel, and there are five of them, get to testify for 5 minutes. We actually have a light up on the clock to let them know what is going on, and we would ask you to stay within that as much as possible. We will give you a little leeway, but not much. We hope you stay within that rule. We limit ourselves to 5 minutes in asking questions when you are all finished.    I would now like to yield to the ranking member, Ms. Velazquez, for the purpose of introducing our very distinguished panel of experts here this morning.    Chairman CHABOT. You are recognized for 5 minutes. Thank you very much.    Chairman CHABOT. Excuse me, Mr. Friedman. You may want to pull the microphone a little closer to your mouth just to make that folks all over the room can hear you, too. Thank you.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much. The one thing I did not note, there is a little doorbell like sound that goes off at the end of the 5 minutes, so just so you know.    Ms. Bland, you are recognized for 5 minutes.    Ms. BLAND. Thank you, Chairman Chabot, Ranking Member Ms. Velazquez, and members of this Committee for the opportunity to testify. Thanks also to our local representatives for your tireless commitment to retaining equitable opportunities for working and middle class New Yorkers and their families.    My name is Bob Bland, and I'm the CEO and founder of MANUFACTURE New York. I created MANUFACTURE New York in 2012 to rethink the fashion ecosystem and create a new vertically integrated 21st century business model that serves the industry's domestic urban manufacturing needs of today and the future. Our mission is to reawaken and rebuild America's fashion industry, foster the next wave of businesses, and create a transparent, sustainable global supply chain.    In the past 3 and a half years, we have grown our community to over 10,000 American designers, manufacturers, technologists, and proponents of domestic production, helped 150 small businesses here in New York City to successfully launch or reshore their apparel lines, and piloted incubator programs for startups in fashion and contracting manufacturing, and accelerated programs for wearable tech startups, thanks in part to the generous support of the SBA Growth Accelerator Fund, which is a great example of a program to help not just small business, but incubator and accelerator programs themselves because they're usually small businesses, and they need help starting up, too.    Since the recession, virtually all small creative and manufacturing businesses in New York City have had the exact same challenges. It was stunning for me at the beginning as a designer finding out that my contract manufacturers had the exact same problems that I did, access to affordable industrial space. Long-term leases, major problem. Relocation grants and construction loans are very hard to come by when you are displaced.    Access to affordable housing is increasingly becoming impossible here in New York City, especially within a reasonable commutable distance. For instance, we have 40 percent of our apparel manufacturing workforce here in New York City in the Flushing area of Queens, and getting them down to South Brooklyn, how in the world do you do that? We have major transportation problems.    There's very low access to working capital that's affordable, and also lines of credit to grow our small businesses, and that's still a huge, major problem. Access to competitive equipment procurement and training programs that are sector specific so that we can adapt to our rapidly-changing industry, are very necessary. They need to also be nationalized in a way that can result in certifications so that people can understand across States and across cities.    Fashion design and manufacturing jobs are more than just jobs. They're inclusive pathways to careers and potential business ownership themselves regardless of educational background or socioeconomic statutes. Typically they pay on average apparel manufacturing $59,750 a year, which is a good job, and they're likely to include benefits and a clear path for growth. Also, skills training is typically included, and opportunities to advance in management positions and beyond.    The New York City fashion ecosystem is unique in that historically New York's iconic garment district in 1931 was the largest garment district in the world. I'd like to say it's the original fashion incubator, and the original incubator program. It was because of the co-location and the proximity of all of the different parts of the supply chain together. It employed 1 million people at its height here in New York City. While it is contracted now to 15,000 apparel manufacturers total for the entire city as of this year, that still accounts for 30 percent of manufacturers in New York City. It's still a very huge sector when it comes to manufacturing. Every single one of those jobs are important.    We have several opportunities coming up at the intersection of fashion sustainability and technology if we seize the moment for urban manufacturing here in New York. There's already 900 fashion companies headquartered here in New York City that employ 180,000 people and generate over $11 billion in wages and $2 billion taxes per year, so it's a big business. The industry at large is a $4 trillion global business, but we're also the number two polluter in the world right behind oil, which is shocking to most people.    From the smallest emerging design startups that are MANUFACTURE New York to the largest department stores and conglomerates, everyone is looking for a solution that includes conceptualization, research and development, commercialization, and a shared set of resources and best practices to capture value and provide accountability at all stages of the supply chain. That's an area that New York City could really take hold, and then connect with other urban manufacturing centers all throughout the United States.    I'd like to say that the best example I've seen of that so far, Representative Ms. Velazquez, you were saying, is that we're now part of one of the Manufacturing Innovation Institutes. That is an Obama Administration initiative to create these advanced manufacturing institutes. The one that we're in is the Revolutionary Textile and Fibers Manufacturing Institute.    And I would like to say that that program--I'd love to give you more information about it--really needs to be expanded to other urban centers because it's a way for us to bring all the stakeholders to the table, all the national educational institutions, all of the state organizations, workforce training, and then to create this network nationally for a specific sector, in this case, the next generation of textiles and fibers.    So thank you very much.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.    Mr. DiMarino, you are recognized for 5 minutes.                 STATEMENT OF MICHAEL DiMARINO    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much.    Ms. Davis, you are recognized for 5 minutes.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much.    Mr. Jacobs, you are recognized for 5 minutes.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much. I want to thank all the members of the panel for their testimony, really excellent testimony from each one. I would now like to turn to the ranking member. I am going to allow her to ask her questions first.    Chairman CHABOT. Okay. The gentlelady's time has expired. I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes.    With the four of you from here to here, let me ask you, when you started out your business, was it just yourself? Did you have anybody else? How many employees do you have now? We will just go down the line so we can get a good idea of what size businesses we are talking. Mr. Jacobs?    Chairman CHABOT. So you have doubled two to four and maybe even further.    Chairman CHABOT. Over what period of time is that?    Chairman CHABOT. Okay, thank you.    Chairman CHABOT. Okay. Ms. Davis?    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much. Mr. DiMarino?    Chairman CHABOT. 1975 did you say?    Chairman CHABOT. Yeah.    Chairman CHABOT. Absolutely, thank you. Ms. Bland?    Ms. BLAND. We started with just me, and 3 and a half years we now have nine full-time W-2 employees, and then two part-time W-2 employees. We have 20 businesses on site, and they all have one or more employees.    Chairman CHABOT. Excellent. You literally are the backbone of this economy, small businesses. Congratulations to each of you for what you have accomplished. It is very impressive, it really is.    Mr. Friedman, let me ask you, you had mentioned the New Market Tax Credit Program. We use that pretty extensively in Cincinnati, especially in revitalizing the downtown area, and we have been pretty successful. In fact, the chairwoman at the time came there and saw a few years back what they are doing down there.    Chairman CHABOT. Yeah. We had a bunch of our colleagues came from other communities around the country to kind of learn about the New Market Tax Credit Program. Now, you mentioned there are some things that could be better. Could you tell the folks how that works in about a minute's time, and what improvements you might make?    Chairman CHABOT. So would it be your recommendation that that is something that Congress ought to look at and maybe adjust accordingly?    Chairman CHABOT. I would yield.    Chairman CHABOT. That is the kind of stuff that we have worked on in a bipartisan manner over the years. We will look at that as a result of this hearing.    Let me ask the four of you again. I think you said no, but has anybody had occasion to use the services of the SBA in the past, the Small Business Administration, either alone or anything? Mr. Jacobs, what was your experience or what did you use them for?    Chairman CHABOT. Speaking of that storm, by the way, Ms. Velazquez was able to get some legislation passed through Congress that had a dramatic impact on that, you know. Did you want to talk about, Nydia?    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much. My time has expired. The gentleman, Mr. Meeks, is recognized for 5 minutes.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired. Before recognizing the gentlelady for her questions, I would like to recognize one of your members of Council here. Councilman Robert Cornegy is here, and he is the chairman of City Council's Small Business Committee.    You all here also in City Council have a small business committee as well, and Councilman Cornegy is the chairman of that committee. We appreciate him being here and showing his interest. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.    Chairman CHABOT. I would now like to recognize the gentlelady from New York, although all my colleagues are gentlefolks from New York, Ms. Clarke, for 5 minutes.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much. The gentlelady yields back. We are going to into one more round of questions here, and I would like to recognize Ranking Member, Ms. Velazquez, for 5 minutes first.    Chairman CHABOT. Okay. Thank you very much. The gentlelady's time has expired. I recognize myself for 5 minutes.    One of the things, and I think, Mr. Friedman, you had mentioned that tax policy is not the primary concern that business folks have, you know, but it certainly is one of the things that they have to consider. I was wondering if any of the members on the panel were aware that towards the end of last year, Congress passed some legislation relative to the Tax Code that was supposed to help especially small businesses that did a couple of things.    One thing, there is Section 179 expensing that you could buy a piece of equipment and take it off all in that year. There are limitations to it, but overall rather than depreciating this over 15 years or a long time, you could take it all off that year right off your taxes. So the incentives, the argument was people would buy that piece of equipment, and put it into service, and become more productive, and be able to take it right off their taxes that year. That would help both that company that bought it, plus the company that made that thing, hopefully made here in the United States. We cannot control that, but hopefully made here, and the people that worked in that factory. That would help the economy. That was the idea.    Also the research and development tax credit, and we made these things, we made them permanent. Let us see. Is that the one was permanent? There is one that was not. Bonus appreciation was the other one. That one is until 2019, I believe, and that is a credit.    But we did those things. A lot of times we had done these in the past, but we just kind of extended it from one year to other, and we did it towards the end of the year, and so you could not plan for it, and so it did not do a lot of good. Well, finally Congress got its act together sort of in a bipartisan manner and got this thing passed, and it should help you to take advantage of the Tax Code out into the future.    First of all, were you aware that this happened, and did anybody get a chance to take advantage of it yet or whatever? Mr. DiMarino?    Chairman CHABOT. I will yield to the gentlelady.    Chairman CHABOT. Yeah. But, to me that would be one criticism of Congress that a lot of times we did this stuff, but we did it towards the end of the year in some gigantic omnibus bill that you throw everything but the kitchen sink in. By the time your accountant has got to go through it and figure out what the heck was in there, it was too late to take advantage of it, and you could not depend on it. But now the stuff that we made, those in particular were permanent.    I would urge all of you to take a look at it because you could buy stuff and take it right off your taxes that year. It is a real advantage, and I would advise all small businesses who may not know about that to look into it.    Another question, and I was going to follow up on something that the ranking member talked about, job training and the skills that you need when you are trying to hire something. I talk to a lot of small businesses in my district, and one complaint that I get is that, you know, we obviously want to have a safety net. If people have been laid off or they have not had employment for a while, something to make sure they can take care of themselves and survive. But sometimes what I hear is unemployment or other things make it such that people will not take the job, you know, at something that the small business could actually afford to pay somebody.    Do you hear this? Is this an experience that you had or want to comment on? Ms. Bland?    Ms. BLAND. I have definitely never had that experience.    Chairman CHABOT. You have not had that experience.    Ms. BLAND. No.    Chairman CHABOT. Okay.    Ms. BLAND. I have had some employees who have been coming, but they ran out of unemployment, and now it is just like, oh, my god, what am I going to do, and then they come to us. Most of the people that I have talked to, I have never personally been on unemployment before, but most of the folks in my community, it is very typical in the freelancer and creative community for people to spend some time on unemployment at some point during their career. And it has nothing to do with laziness.    Chairman CHABOT. Okay.    Ms. BLAND. I would say that until we have a social safety net for freelancers that is a little bit more coherent than now, we are not going to have that truly flexible talent pool that all businesses can take advantage of. Right now it is a little wooden where I have to keep people as full time, part time, or I am probably going to risk losing them as opposed to if we had a little bit more play with it, we could have people on a more hourly basis as opposed to either full time or part time.    Chairman CHABOT. Okay. Thank you. My time is just about ready to expire, so I will not ask another question. I will now yield to the gentlelady for 5 minutes, Ms. Clarke.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you. Before coming to Congress, I was a lawyer, and if we made it too plain and simple, we would put them all out of work, though. I am sure you would not want to see that, right? No. I am sure we probably would.    But I can just say this has been extremely helpful, I think, to all members that we were able to be here today. I would like to yield to my colleague, Ms. Velazquez, if she would like to make a closing statement or a closing point or two.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much. The gentlelady yields back. I want to, as chair of the Committee, thank the Council of New York City for opening up their chambers to us today to let the United States Congress come here and use these fine historic facilities. We do appreciate it. We appreciate the folks here in the audience, and especially the panel members here for their testimony. This has been very helpful to us. We will take what we learn here back to our colleagues in the Congress, and hopefully we will do whatever we can to help to improve the climate for especially small business manufacturers in the United States, so thank you very much.    And if there is no further business to come before the Committee, we are adjourned. Thank you.
