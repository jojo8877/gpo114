    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I'm happy to report for the record that my sister does remember my birthday but my brothers do not.    On that same line, though, Dr. Casado, you can have the best technology in the world, you can have great training, but if employees are negligent in their use of it, you're still exposing yourself, and I bring this up in the context of an article that was in the Wall Street Journal back June--actually it was June 9th, and it relates to the fact that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency had sent a memo to their employees in 2011 because they had seen an uptick in cyber-attacks related to employees using the federal server to access their personal websites or their personal email. Unfortunately, the labor union filed a grievance and prevented them from doing that, and that's apparently where one of the breaches occurred later last year. And my question is, and this would be both for corporations and for the federal government, does it make sense to prevent employees either in the private sector or in the government sector from using their company servers or the federal servers to access personal information--their personal servers, their personal websites, their emails?    Mr. Palmer. Mr. Clinton?    Mr. Palmer. I think that's a great point because you can have a public access, a separate environment where people could do that but they have to use it because, for instance, if you'd been a federal employee, Dr. Casado, and you had opened that email from your sister through the federal mainframe, would that have potentially infected----    Mr. Palmer. But can you not create a separate environment?    Mr. Palmer. Mr. Wood, you wanted to comment?    Mr. Palmer. My time's expired but I do want to thank the witnesses for the clarity of your answers. This has been an excellent hearing.    Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and I yield back.    Chairwoman Comstock. Thank you, and I now recognize Mr. Swalwell.
