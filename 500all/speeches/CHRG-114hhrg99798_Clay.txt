    Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you and the ranking member for conducting this hearing.    Mr. Ellis, the question of how to balance the goals of affordability and risk-based rates has been a key question for Congress in seeking to improve the National Flood Insurance Program over the years. Do you believe that these goals are fundamentally opposed, or do you believe that there is a way to appropriately balance these goals?    Mr. Clay. Thank you for that response. Mr. Woods, an example of Missourians rebuilding just recently, is that over the holidays, we experienced flooding in and around the St. Louis region. One community allowed for the homes to be elevated after the last flood. I guess they put some of the houses on stilts, I will say.    Do you think that is smart, as far as allowing them to remain there and raise the elevation? This time, they still had to evacuate the community because the water rose too high. What do you think about them elevating and raising the level of the house?    Mr. Clay. Another question: Can you explain why the removal of grandfathered and subsidized rates on existing homes is a concern to your organization, which represents the interests of builders of newly constructed homes?    Mr. Clay. Thank you for your response. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
