    Mr. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to both witnesses. I would like to start with Mr. Thorn. Mr. Thorn, it is rumored that Brazil is collecting evidence and planning to bring the WTO case against U.S. farm support programs. Obviously from your previous comments and the many questions my colleagues have brought forth, and they claim that U.S. farm subsidies are increasing which they think is going to further depress their markets. In considering this claim, it is important to address Brazil's use of domestic and export subsidies. And can you explain what types of support programs Brazil's farmers receive and what incentives are used to subsidize their exports?    Mr. Davis. All right. Thank you very much. Dr. Hudson, thank you for being here today. When my colleague, Mr. Neugebauer, said go Raiders being an Oakland Raiders fan, I thought he was talking about them. Then I realized that you are with Texas Tech, a fine university, albeit not the University of Illinois, the greatest university, but maybe someday you could go there. That would be great.    The database of crop subsidies by foreign governments is quite impressive that you put together, and among the multitude of the foreign subsidies that our U.S. farmers have to compete with and many in my State of Illinois, especially are those who are growing corn and soybeans in central Illinois.    Can you point to a few of the country and crop combinations? Maybe focus on those two for my sake if you could, which foreign subsidies have the greatest potential to impact markets?    Mr. Davis. Go Raiders.    Mr. Davis. Thank you both very much.    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. Ms. Kuster, for 5 minutes.
