    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Mr. Tonko.    I now recognize myself for five minutes for questions.    Dr. Cordova, at one point the National Science Foundation had over $1 billion in expired grant money. Is that still the case?    Mr. Palmer. Okay. Well, one of the reasons I ask is when you have--you are under a time limit, that that can create some incentives to fund projects that I would say the public would find questionable in terms of scientific research. For instance, I believe we funded a grant to study the gambling habits of monkeys at $171,000. You spent $856,000 on studying--teaching lions to run on a treadmill and I am just wondering if--what the rationale would be for funding some of those projects because as a Member, we get some pretty intense criticism, particularly in such a tight budget environment that we are living in right now.    Mr. Palmer. And I would be interested.    Mr. Palmer. Thank you. Also, could you update us on your decision to relocate headquarters to Alexandria and explain some of the factors that are causing a delay in that move?    Mr. Palmer. Let me----    Mr. Palmer. So you asked for----    Mr. Palmer. Let me throw this in----    Mr. Palmer. --real quick. You asked for almost $31 million to----    Mr. Palmer. --to fund the move. Does that include a potential cost as a result of the delays?    Mr. Palmer. Okay.    Mr. Palmer. Well, thank you all for being here. I am fascinated with the work you are doing, particularly the quantum-based information, Dr. May.    My time is expired. I now yield to Ms. Esty.    Mr. Palmer. I now recognize Ms. Bonamici.    Mr. Palmer. I now recognize Ms. Clark.    Mr. Palmer. Dr. May, will you hit your button please?    Mr. Palmer. Without objection, I recognize Ranking Member Lipinski for one minute.    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Mr. Lipinski.    I thank the witnesses for their valuable testimony and the Members for their questions. The record will remain open for two weeks for additional comments and written questions from the Members. The witnesses are excused and this hearing is adjourned.
