    Ms. Walorski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Ms. Halliday, for being here yet again.    I guess I am, I would call this report, this IG report a crisis in confidence again with the VA and with some of these senior level executives. And I guess I echo back to what Representative Roe said. The discrepancy that is happening in this country between these high level VA executives and the veterans that are in the districts that we all sit in here and represent today, to me it is reprehensible. And we are looking at yet another crisis in confidence.    I have been here, I am only in my third year. I am one of the youngest members on this panel. You have been here since I have been here. When you look at yet another, yet another one of these examples of egregious spending, benefits that people in the private sector do not even have, people in my district cannot even relate to these issues of paying people to move, at the exorbitant amount of money. Do you look at this at any point, as the Inspector General, and say there is an issue with confidence here with these senior executives?    And I guess to my other colleagues' point, you know whether this is nationwide or not, I would have to suspect based on just the data that we have seen in the three years we have been here, this is just the same old, same old, status quo behavior. There has not been a whole lot of shake down when it comes to what kind of federal benefits are given to these senior executives in the VA. Do you see a confidence issue here as you look at these, at the tangible data that you have?    Ms. Walorski. I agree. And I can tell you that my office number still rings every single day in Indiana's Second District with veterans that need help. They need our help in mitigating a system and bringing down the mountains of bureaucracy just so they can access the basic services that they were promised by this government when they signed up to go fight for freedom. And I think that it is just another egregious example that I look at this as a huge crisis in confidence yet again. That we feel like we have taken a couple of steps forward and we go backward when we look at egregious spending. And that is where the Americans do disconnect. That is where our veterans simply cannot trust this government. And I think that it is an atrocity that as we continue to dig deep, further in the weeds on this issue that we have got to hold additional people accountable and make sure that the actions of the senior executives of the VA are absolutely transparent to the American public. And so we have a long road ahead and I yield back my time, Mr. Chairman, thank you.    The Chairman. Thank you very much. Mr. Walz, you are recognized for five minutes.
