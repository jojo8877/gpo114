    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to extend my thanks to Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, and the majority and minority staffs for their work in organizing today's markup.    The resolution that I have offered in a substitute amendment is intended to serve as a direct message to Boko Haram that their terror and extremism will not be ignored. Their ideology will not be tolerated, and their legacy of savagery will not endure in the annals of history. Like so many across the world, I am outraged by the brutality and senselessness of Boko Haram's crimes. As we work with the international community to reduce the threat of terrorism around the world, we are reminded that Boko Haram has killed over 5,000 people in Nigeria in 2014 and displaced over 1 million innocent people.    Boko Haram has abducted hundreds of civilians using women and children as slaves and subjecting them to sexual abuse, suicide bombers, and child soldiers. Boko Haram has threatened to disrupt the Nigerian elections and intimidate would-be voters. Victimizing innocent men, women, and children for perverse and ideological gain will never be tolerated or treated as just by the international community. With our vote today, this committee can affirm that we stand for the human rights, dignity, and security of the Nigerian people. We will not tolerate a world in which Boko Haram or any terrorist organization can slaughter innocent civilians; we respect the right of women to be educated without the threat of violence; and that we support free and fair elections that do not have the threat of suppression and intimidation lingering around them.    While they are not on this committee, I want to thank our colleagues Congresswomen Frederica Wilson and Corrine Brown for their leadership on this issue, and I again thank the chairman and ranking member for their work in marking up this resolution.    I yield back.
