    Mr. Weber. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Vejvoda, you said political losses become economic winners in the new economy because they have insider information. So what you are seeing is a government, a country in turmoil, where it is going down because of the corruption, and yet the very ones who caused it to go down actually become the economic winners in the new order, if you will. Fix that for me.    Mr. Weber. Uh-huh.    Mr. Weber. But what do you do, specifics, how do you prevent that from happening?    Mr. Weber. Holistic or ballistic?    Mr. Weber. Okay. I missed that.    Mr. Weber. Yeah. Let me ask you this. I think you compared and contrasted, was it Yugoslavia and Poland or was it Ukraine----    Mr. Weber. Okay.    Mr. Weber. So Poland, the process in Poland good, the process in Ukraine bad?    Mr. Weber. Why? What is the difference?    Mr. Weber. Is that because somebody stepped up to the plate and took the lead on that?    Mr. Weber. So what you are describing is a political will married to individual courage.    Mr. Weber. All right. Well, thank you.    Let me move on. I know I am getting over my time. And so let me go to Mr. Kolesnikov.    You have a successful business in Europe, true?    Mr. Weber. Did you have one in Russia?    Mr. Weber. Did you lose it?    Mr. Weber. But you took those business principles that you learned in Russia and you applied them in Europe.    Mr. Weber. Should that be incentive enough for someone to have the political will and marry it to that individual courage I talked about and make a better life, not just for them, but for their kids and their grandkids and the rest of the country?    Mr. Weber. Okay. Welcome to the American Dream.    Mr. Weber. Well, it is what I like to say, all the smart Russians over in Russia ain't over in Russia, they are over here.    But let me end with this. How do you communicate to people in Russia that that American Dream, democracy, capitalism, free enterprise, is worth the risk and the price? When you do that, you will have enough people that will rise up and take that country.    Mr. Weber. Who was it that said the pen is mightier than the sword? Apparently he had never been in a sword fight.    Well, thank you for being here today. You have your work cut out for you.
