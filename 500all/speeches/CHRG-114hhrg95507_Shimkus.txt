    Mr. Shimkus. Thank you. Sorry for bouncing back and forth. I have another hearing upstairs, and met with the funeral home directors, and so we are trying to do multiple things at once.    Mr. Kamen, it is great to see you. Charlie Bass, it is good to see you. Secretary, good to see you back in the crowd.    FIRST Robotics. I will do the plug, right? We talked earlier, so the actual--the championship is in St. Louis, Missouri, which is right across the river from where I live. We follow it very, very closely. Thank you for that because now, it has gone not just into high school, but in the middle schools and in the grade schools with the Lego thing. And our Christian Dade School that I graduated from, my wife teaches at, they are all in it, and it is a great thing that you have started and I want to give that plug here.    Also, I would like to go on just the issue, I know you have a great diverse background as an inventor in the medical field, insulin pumps, dialysis, why are you interested in this energy debate?    Mr. Shimkus. It is the--and you have to use it when you get it, right?    Mr. Shimkus. And I think the last time you really testified was on that technology also, as I remember.    Mr. Christiansen, I was interested in your testimony, and of course, I am from a cold part of the country, that is a big debate here, but you--this--as I understand it, the provisions of getting--we want to create efficiencies by our major generators, the base load folks, and sometimes that goes up and down, and then--and peekers come in, so just briefly, how do we segue your technology, and what is it again, and then how do you think it is being reviewed and accepted by our friends down the street at the Environmental Protection Agency?    Mr. Shimkus. Great, thank you.    And I want to end up with Mr. Siebel. What do you see the primary regulatory burdens preventing utilities from grading adoption of new information technologies?    Mr. Shimkus. And I thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sorry for going past.
