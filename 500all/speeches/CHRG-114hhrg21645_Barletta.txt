    Mr. Barletta. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Since the beginning of the 114th Congress, we have been exploring the rising costs of disasters in terms of both the loss of property and human life. At our first hearing in the 114th Congress, I stated that my top emergency management priority was pursuing disaster legislation that will save lives, lower costs, and launch a comprehensive review of Federal disaster policies and the rising costs of disasters.    Early last year, Ranking Member Carson and I introduced the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act to call for the first comprehensive assessment of disaster costs and losses in over 20 years.    One of the most important pieces of our country's disaster assistance policy is linked to the National Flood Insurance Program, or the NFIP. So, today's hearing focusing on FEMA's authorities to implement the NFIP, and the extent that those authorities can impact local land-use and development decisions, is a critical element of that discussion.    I thank Ranking Member DeFazio for bringing this issue to the forefront so that we could bring the right people together to help us understand how some of the challenges being faced in Oregon will impact the entire Nation. I look forward to hearing from FEMA, the State and local officials, and our representatives from the National Association of Home Builders, about their current challenges and concerns regarding these issues. Thank you.    Mr. Barletta . Thank you. As a former mayor, I completely appreciate the effort and money that a community puts into land-use planning, infrastructure, development, and economic revitalization. I also believe that local officials are in the best position to know and understand the unique challenges facing their communities so that they can implement the best policies to benefit their citizens.    Now, from what I had heard today it sounds as if one part of the Federal Government, NOAA's Fisheries Service, is asking another part of the Federal Government, FEMA, to impose land-use restrictions on State and local government. That would certainly cause concerns and have great implications across this country.    Mr. Grimm, the Oregon RPA requires FEMA to amend existing and issue new regulations regarding development in the flood plain. From FEMA's perspective, what does that mean for people in my home State of Pennsylvania and other areas of the country?    Mr. Barletta. And from FEMA's perspective, what is the role of the NFIP? And does the Oregon RPA require you to do things outside of the roles and authorities which Congress prescribed to you?    Mr. Barletta. Mr. Chandler, if FEMA is forced to comply with the Oregon RPA, what will be the most significant impact on local housing development? And will that be local to only Oregon, or will there be repercussions across the country?    Mr. Barletta. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Ranking Member Carson for 5 minutes.    Mr. Barletta. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Gibbs from Ohio.    Mr. Barletta. The Chair recognizes Ms. Norton for 5 minutes.    Mr. Barletta. The Chair recognizes Mr. Webster from Florida for 5 minutes.

The chair will now begin a second round.    OK, the Chair will now recognize Mr. Graves for 5 minutes.    Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the--Mr. DeFazio for bringing these issues up.    I had a few questions. Number one, Mr. Grimm, H.R. 2901 passed the House unanimously, as I recall, a few months ago, and that would effectively allow for private insurers to offer flood insurance. If someone--if that were to become law and folks were to offer private insurance, would this have an effect on property owners, if they use private flood insurance, as opposed to going through NFIP?    Mr. Barletta. I now recognize Mr. DeFazio for an additional 5 minutes.    Mr. Barletta. So ordered.        Mr. Barletta. Thank you. And I would like to thank you all for your testimony. Your comments have been helpful to today's discussion.    If there are no further questions, I would ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided answers to any questions that may be submitted to them in writing, and unanimous consent that the record remain open for 15 days for any additional comments and information submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record of today's hearing.    Without objection, so ordered. I would like to thank our witnesses again for their testimony today. If no other Members have anything to add, the subcommittee stands adjourned.
