    Mr. Massie. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And, Mr. Rinaldi, I just want to reiterate something my colleague said earlier, that air traffic controllers, particularly in my district, do a wonderful job, and we feel very safe with your men at the helm, and women.    I want to ask you the first question, though. I was able to go into an air traffic control tower at CVG . And the first thing that struck me, besides the professionalism of your crew, is the antiquated technology. I mean it looked like a computer room from the 1980s, and that is being kind. Could you share with us what sort of tools that you would like to have that the FAA has not incorporated into the air traffic control regime, and what the benefits of those are?    Mr. Massie. Thank you.    Mr. Poole, I don't think there has been enough time dedicated in this hearing to the sorts of technological advancements that we have missed out on in this country, in air traffic control, and what the advantages of those would be, and that we have seen in other countries. Could you talk to that?    Mr. Massie. And would----    Mr. Massie. Would those advantages be available to general aviation, as well?    Mr. Massie. So, what leads you to believe that we are going to see these advancements if we pass this bill?    Mr. Massie. Well, I like your model, that they need to think of themselves more as a customer service utility----    Mr. Massie . Instead of just a safety organization whose only customer is Congress.    But, Mr. Chairman, my time has expired, and I yield back.    Mr. Massie. So we may be renting their system.
