    Mr. Curbelo. Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity, and I thank all the witnesses for coming this morning.    Admiral, a question for you. What is the Coast Guard doing to monitor potential risk from small-vessel attacks in U.S. ports, and distinguish between legitimate vessel operators and those engaged in illicit activities? This is of particular interest to us in south Florida. We have many small vessels in our waters. Please, go ahead.    Mr. Curbelo. So it seems a daunting task to track small-vessel activity. Can you get into the degree of coordination you have with local authorities to help extend the Coast Guard's reach and really monitor this as much as possible?    Mr. Curbelo. Also your testimony states the Coast Guard conducts over 400 routine inspections in general law enforcement boardings every day to ensure vessels comply with international maritime law and safety standards, applicable U.S. law and regulations, and any control procedures required to access the Nation's ports.    Well, what are the infractions that are typical of one of these boardings or inspections?    Mr. Curbelo. Do you have a rough estimate of how many of these approximately 400 daily boardings are small vessels?    Mr. Curbelo. Sure.    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you, Admiral.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
