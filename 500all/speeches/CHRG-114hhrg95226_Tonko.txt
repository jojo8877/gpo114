    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to our witnesses.    Mr. Tonko. Dr. Paulson, as you are well aware, beyond the economic costs associated with climate change, there are very serious public health risks related to increases in the global temperature, for example, longer heat waves, changes in water and air quality, and foodborne and insectborne disease. Climate change also has the potential to exacerbate existing health conditions such as asthma and adversely impact vulnerable populations like children that you serve and the elderly.    What kinds of ongoing health risks are expected if the current climate trends continue, and do these risks, in your opinion, vary by region of our country?    Mr. Tonko. Right, and we've also seen some of the proposals, the expected impacts on coastal areas of New York State.    How can implementing the Clean Power Plan help states address these public health impacts of climate change?    Mr. Tonko. I thank you, and with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
