    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, Mr. Secretary for being here. Appreciate you being here today.    We've received some reports that the Federal Student Aid, FSA, and the Office of Postsecondary Education, OPE, do not always communicate effectively, and, in general, most offices within the Department are siloed from each other, which harms coordination and efficiency. This came to a head in November when former Secretary Duncan sent a memo to FSA and to OPE instructing them to find a better process for communicating effectively in regards to accreditation issues.    How did this communication become so ineffective it required a memo from the head of the agency? And then what are you doing within the Department to make the communication practices effective overall, better overall?    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. And I believe Dr. Foxx had asked a question at the end of her time and didn't have time for a response. And just to remind you, because I know you've had a lot of questions since then, she asked: How do you plan to ensure FSA is acting as an effective partner with institutions as its PBO status requires?    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you for your answers, and congratulations on your selection. We look forward to working with you over the next year.    And I yield back 40 seconds.
