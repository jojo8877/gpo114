    Ms. Fudge. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you both for being here. Certainly I really very much appreciate the discussion you were having about veterans, and just want to bring to your attention that today at noon there is going to be a briefing in Canon 340 about veteran food insecurity. So if anyone sitting here today would like to attend, certainly it is open to you.    Let me just say that I thank the witnesses for the work they do. I thank you very much for how dedicated you are to eradicating hunger. And please do understand that what I am about to say does not have anything to do with you, is not directed to you, or any other person who has testified about SNAP or food insecurity. This is our tenth hearing on SNAP or food insecurity. It has, in fact, become an exercise in futility. It is a waste of our time if we are not going to do something about it. We can talk, and talk, and talk. I have no idea what the outcome is, or what we are even looking to do. What I do know is that hunger is not a game. It is not something that we play with. It is life and death for far too many Americans.    We know the statistics. We have the data. We know the problem. I don't know why we keep asking you. We know the problem. We know about hungry veterans. We know about hungry seniors and hungry kids. When are we going to stop talking and do something? We can talk forever and never change one person's life. So the next hearing I want to go to about SNAP is how we are going to make it better. I don't want to hear any more of this. Enough. Let us do what the American people sent us here to do. We need to take care of our poor. We need to take care of our children. We need to take care of our veterans. It is time to stop talking. I yield back.    The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady for yielding back. Mr. LaMalfa, 5 minutes.
