    Mr. Chabot. I can get them in now if that's okay.    Mr. Chabot. Couldn't we get our questions in before we leave, Mr. Chairman?    Mr. Chabot. Okay. I'll try to be quick.    Mr. Chabot. Thank you. I would like to reiterate the comments of my distinguished colleague from Michigan that we thank Ms. Jackson Lee for offering a moment of silence. A horrific, horrific event that took place. Although I wasn't here for the moment of silence, I appreciate that. I'd like to express that.    Ms. Hess, is there a current number of total outstanding rape kits nationally, approximate? And if so, do you know what the number is?    Mr. Chabot. Thousands, did you say?    Mr. Chabot. That's a pretty vague number really. I think you just got a sheet there?    Mr. Chabot. Okay. That's fine. Is there a State-by-State breakdown that's available? If you don't have it, is there somewhere we could get access to something like that? Like, I would like to know what Ohio is since that's my State.    Mr. Chabot. Okay, if we could get that.    Mr. Chabot. I appreciate that. Thank you.    Ms. Wolf, you mention in your testimony that several of your members are currently participating in pilot programs and validation studies to develop best practices for the widespread deployment of these systems. Could you share briefly any progress that you've reached at this point. And, again, kind of brief.    Mr. Chabot. Okay. If I can cut you off there. Thank you, i appreciate that, because I'm trying to be quick.    Ms. Alexenko, thank you for your bravery in stepping forth on this issue and trying to help others that may be in similar circumstances. Thank you very much for that.    How did you learn that the rape kit was sitting there untested for 9\1/2\ years?    Mr. Chabot. Who told you? I mean, how did you learn?    Mr. Chabot. How long was that after the event itself?    Mr. Chabot. Nine and a half years.    Mr. Chabot. Was this criminal, was he ever in custody during that period of time?    Mr. Chabot. So logically, if they had tested it and they had him in custody, perhaps----    Mr. Chabot. Okay. Thank you.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
