    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.    Mr. Ehnes, one of our witnesses is very critical of the impact your hobby has on the environment. Is this the sort of hostility you face from Federal law enforcement, or would this be an example of a rare exception that poisons the well at a time when you are trying to build trust with the agencies?    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you.    Sheriff Brown, as an elected sheriff, you have a fundamental level of accountability that your colleagues in the Forest Service do not. How does this undermine your ability to keep your constituents safe?    Mrs. Radewagen. Mr. Larkin, are there examples of decriminalizing regulatory offenses, or is this a genie out of the bottle situation where reversing course is near impossible?    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
