    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it. Thanks to both of you for showing up today, and thank you for your testimony.    Chairman Wheeler, in March we discussed public safety interference complaint responses, and a resulting quarterly report, which you thought was a good idea. I know you have provided some information. Have you posted what you provided the Committee on the Web site so the public can see what is going on, and what you are doing?    Mr. Bilirakis. You have?    Mr. Bilirakis. Have you posted online----    Mr. Bilirakis. Can you get that information----    Mr. Bilirakis . To us as soon as possible?    Mr. Bilirakis. Yes. And if you haven't, I mean, can you post that online as soon as possible?    Mr. Bilirakis. OK, very good. Commissioner Pai, there has been a lot of attention and concern regarding the designated entity auction rules. Do you believe there are now correctly--are they now correctly balanced, and if not, what should be done to fix them?    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you. Chairman Wheeler, in the open Internet order you committed to take steps to prevent increases in poll attachment rates that might result from reclassifying broadband. What steps have you taken since the order to prevent such increases, and what additional steps are expected, sir?    Mr. Bilirakis. OK. Again, can you continue to update us on this?    Mr. Bilirakis. Appreciate it very much. All right, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
