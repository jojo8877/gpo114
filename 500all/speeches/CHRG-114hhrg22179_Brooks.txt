    Mrs. Brooks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you all to your panelists for your actually exciting testimony. I wasn't sure when I was reading this initially.    But I think why this is so exciting is because I think this is the way to draw young people back into manufacturing. We have in central Indiana, in my district, about 50 middle and high schools that have 3D printers that are being utilized in the classroom. Indiana is one of the country's most manufacturing-intensive States.    And then before coming to Congress, I was senior vice president at our State's community college, and where I learned about 3D printing during that time period, but I think we still need to make sure that the adults and the educators who are working with our young people have an understanding about this 3D printing.    I had an event, and we welcomed 3D Parts Manufacturing to educate school counselors at a school counselor event, to try to educate them about 3D printing, because they are the ones who influence our children and get them excited about these things.    So I am curious, in expanding on the public-private partnerships, which I completely believe in, how do we do a better job bringing industry, collaborating with our educators and with either our nonprofits, and try and get the young people more engaged in 3D printing and skills that they need? What are some best practices you have seen? How do we expand this? Because I think it is one of the manufacturing tools of the future. What do we need to be doing better?    And believe it or not, I actually think calling the place where they work maker spaces actually helps because young people are not as interested in manufacturing, I think, as they are in making.    Mr. Morris, you want to start?    Mrs. Brooks. But if you think about--so, Dr. Herderick, GE is located in so many locations across the country, UPS obviously is, I don't know that your company is yet, but, I mean, what do you view as industry's role in partnering with the education community? And I welcome the fact that you put them into libraries and so forth, but what should we be doing that we are not doing?    Mrs. Brooks. Thank you.    Thank you. My time has expired.
