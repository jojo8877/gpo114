    Mr. Lee. I have a short statement.    Thank you, Chairman Smith and members of the subcommittee for the opportunity to develop and present remarks about the 2015 Trafficking In Persons Report.    The scourge of modern day trafficking in persons touches every region of the globe, including that of the Western Hemisphere. And the Bureau of the Western Hemisphere Affairs takes trafficking in persons and the challenge of addressing effective solutions to it very seriously. We regularly engage with partner governments to encourage the prosecution of traffickers, provide protection to victims, and to provide programs for prevention.    Our Embassy personnel are on the front lines of this diplomatic engagement, whether at the senior level of the front office of our Ambassadors, whether at the working level with the ministries of foreign affairs, justice, or the security or public security ministries. And in addition, our Embassy personnel provide the reporting that informs much of the annual Trafficking In Persons Report.    U.S. programs that promote rule of law, good governance, citizen security, and economic prosperity throughout the Western Hemisphere seek to address the underlying factors that allow trafficking in persons to persist. For example, the Department of State funds capacity building of law enforcement and immigration officials in the region to screen and identify victims of human trafficking and to investigate and prosecute those cases.    We work closely with the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons and with partner governments to compile the most accurate information that will allow us and our partners to assess government efforts and work toward the most effective solutions.    I look forward to answering your questions.    ----------                                  Mr. Lee. Thank you, Chairman.    You asked in your opening presentation whether a TIP upgrade was a subject of discussion in the reestablishment of diplomatic relations. And I can answer categorically that it was not.    Mr. Lee. It was completely separate. And but I would like to make the observation that our constructive engagement with the Cubans, which was basically done prior to the normalization talks in the migration talks, which I participated in, we have been talking about TIP sets of issues. And there was a distinct change on the Cuban side after they acceded to the Palermo Protocol, the Palermo Convention in mid-2013.    What happened after that was kind of an accelerated bilateral engagement on TIP in a way that had never occurred before. And so in a sense, our understanding of what the Cuban Government was doing, whether on prosecutions, protection, or prevention, greatly increased as a result of these exchanges.    So, for example, we had in November 2013, a first videoconference of TIP experts at a very senior level on both countries.    In March 2014 we had a joint J/TIP and WHA visit to Havana looking at what the Cuban Government was doing on the ground in a way that we had never had access to.    In February 2015 Under Secretary Sewall had a meeting with the main Cuban Foreign Ministry official responsible for the United States, again to emphasize the importance of TIP in our bilateral relationship.    A month later a technical-level group of TIP, Cuban TIP experts came to the United States for a series of technically focused meetings. And----    Mr. Lee. Thank you, Chairman.    I was essentially going through a litany of engagements. But to make the larger point that our understanding of what the Cuban Government does and does not do has greatly increased in the past couple of years and in a sense has been a beneficiary of the more constructive engagement between the two governments in those areas both governments have decided to work on in a cooperative manner, of which trafficking in persons is one of those.    So for all of the areas that we have reported and identified in the TIP Report on Cuba that we need to work on, we have established with the Cuban Government, an ongoing process of sharing information that allows us to make our points and also understand what they are doing and what they are not doing. And that is basically the point I wanted to make.    Thank you, sir.
