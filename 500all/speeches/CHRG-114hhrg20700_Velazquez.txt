    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is my pleasure to welcome back Mr. Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of the Economic Policy Institute. Prior to joining EPI, he worked as a former commissioner of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission and as the policy director of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Welcome.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Eisenbrey, from 1979 to 2013 inflation-adjusted wages have grown 15 percent for the bottom 90 percent of income earners, while wages for the top 1 percent have grown 137 percent. I think that it is very clear that something has to be done. How will this rule accomplish that?    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. California has the highest state overtime standards and over the last 5 years has led the country in employment growth. Is what California did a model for the Nation?    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. And how do these findings compare to the testimony we have heard today?    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.    As we all know, the cost of living and therefore wages drastically differ based upon the location of the business. And this one was one the most common concerns in comments filed, that the proposed changes do not account for the diverse economies across the country.    Why did DOL choose to go with a national minimum salary threshold instead of keying it to government data on regional cost-of-living differences?    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Small-business owners, and we heard them here, are warning that they may have to move currently salaried employees to hourly rates. This can be construed as a demotion by these workers and can impact their morale and even their fringe benefits. Is there a way for small businesses to avoid such changes under the final rule?    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you. I yield back.
