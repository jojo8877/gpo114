    Mr. Grothman. Okay. I'll ask a couple questions here, Mr. Ferriero. About how many employees do you have at the National Archives?    Mr. Grothman. Wow.    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Do you have ever keep track like compared to other agencies how many employees, I guess, leave prematurely? You know, turn over not normal retirement age.    Mr. Grothman. Yeah. Among regular employees, like out of every, whatever 100, how many leave every year? Do you know?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Do you ever do followup and find out why they're leaving?    Mr. Grothman. Okay. Thanks. Maybe we'll ask this same question of Mr. Goldenkoff. You know, how many--first of all, how many employees do you have?    Mr. Grothman. Same thing. And we'll give you the same question. What's your turnover among--turnover by, you know, not retiring but non-retirement age.    Mr. Grothman. Okay. So neither of you feel that there's a--if your employees are unhappy, it's not unhappy--so unhappy that they're leaving.    Mr. Grothman. I see she's got a nice smile on her face. So she certainly looks satisfied. There she is. Very good.    And Mr. Ferriero was shaking his head. As I unfairly asked two people a question simultaneously, he was shaking his head, but now I'll yield the rest of my time to the--Congressman Meadows.
