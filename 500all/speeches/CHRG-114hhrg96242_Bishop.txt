    Chairman Bishop . All right. We are now under Resource rules, which means we have a second panel that has been sitting for 2 hours, waiting to be heard.    We are going to move this quickly through, which means your 5 minutes, I am going to gavel you down at the end of it. For your answers, if it comes to 5 minutes and you are in the middle of a sentence, I am going to stop you.    For the rest of you Members, do not wait until there are 10 seconds left before you ask her a question. Give her a fair chance to do this.    But we are going to keep the 5-minute rule and get along, so we can get the other panel in here.    Delegate Norton, you are next up for 5 minutes.
