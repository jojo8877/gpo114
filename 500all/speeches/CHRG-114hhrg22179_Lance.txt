    Mr. Lance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A very interesting hearing.    Mr. Orringer, balancing health and safety is obviously an important mission for medical device manufacturers and Federal regulators alike. What steps are the Federal regulators taking in order to educate themselves and the public about 3D-printed surgical implants? Has this approach been proactive? And what else, in your judgment, could be done?    Mr. Lance. I trust those at Medicare and Medicaid and CMS will be monitoring this hearing, because obviously we need those codes for the reasons you have suggested.    Mr. Morris, you wish to comment?    Mr. Lance. To the distinguished members of the panel, are we in the advance in this country or do other countries, perhaps in Europe or Asia, have a system that recognizes this to a greater extent than we do in this country?    Mr. Lance. Thank you. My time has expired, but I hope to be able to purchase this further in the future. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
