    Ms. Frankel. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Mr. Secretary, pardon my voice, but I want to thank you for your service. I truly admire what you have to deal with. And earlier, you rightly stated that we live in a very complex world. The threats we face are multifaceted, unlike the bipolar threat we faced during the cold war. I just call it complexity on steroids, and I think you are dealing with a puzzle that doesn't have the pieces that match. And I am interested in how we manage and balance competing interests in the world, and I want to give just examples. So, for example, when we respond to Russian aggression threats, especially to our allies in Europe, how does that impact our effort to prevent a nuclear Iran or reach a political solution with Assad? When we go to eliminate ISIL, are we thereby strengthening Assad, who is killing hundreds of thousands of his own people? Are we strengthening Iran, like we did when we overthrew Saddam Hussein?    And I know, I think we see Egypt as an ally against ISIL, and so the question is why do we continue to withhold financial support? So I guess my question is, what is the guiding strategy for American foreign policy in this very interconnected complex world?
