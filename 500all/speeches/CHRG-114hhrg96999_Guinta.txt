    Mr. Guinta. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you all for coming here and indulging our first vote series, and we appreciate it.    As we know, Section 165 of Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve Board to apply enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. Thirty-seven bank holdings currently have assets greater than $50 billion that are subject to enhanced supervision.    Under that same section, a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must comply with and hold capital equal to--or equal with the requirements of regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve.    Mr. Kini, in your testimony you stated that Section 165 does not allow the Federal Reserve to raise the $50 billion threshold or to avoid applying the mandatory enhanced prudential standards to any set of greater-than-$50-billion asset bank holding companies. This provision only allows the Federal Reserve to vary application of enhanced prudential standards.    Does this give regulators enough flexibility to ensure that institutions above the $50 billion threshold are not overburdened by tougher rules?    Mr. Guinta. Okay. So the FSOC doesn't, and the Federal Reserve doesn't, only Congress.    Mr. Guinta. Okay. I thank you.    I yield back to the Chair.
