    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I think this is an important hearing and I thank the witnesses for being here today.    We're meeting to continue our discussion on one of the great bipartisan success stories of this committee, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, or MACRA.    Our panel of witnesses practice in a variety of settings across the country and represent diverse expertise and training. They each have the unique perspective to share with us regarding the implementation of MACRA.    The law put in place a dual track system for providers instead of the patchwork of quality reporting systems that providers currently use. They will instead use the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS, and MIPS will streamline quality reporting for providers and incentivize high-quality efficient care.    Providers are most enthused to use alternative payment models, or APMs, which have also proven to increase quality and lower costs.    Today we'll discuss the steps all providers can take to modernize their practices, provide higher quality care for their patients and successfully transition to the new payment models established by MACRA, and this will be our second hearing on MACRA implementation. I'm pleased this committee is performing such thoughtful oversight.    While we know that MACRA is already showing promising results, these hearings are necessary to ensure that the law reaches its full potential and I look forward to discussing the tools and best practices physicians can employ to help make MACRA work effectively for all.    Mr. Pallone. So I just want to yield the remainder of my time to Congresswoman Matsui from California.
