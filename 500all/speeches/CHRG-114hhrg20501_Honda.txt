    Mr. Honda. To follow up on that, you said that you do not choose sites for them, but in our country we have depressed areas like our chairman talks about, certain communities that are being hit because of the energy shift. And it seems to me that some attention should be paid to those communities where they might want to be able to look at those communities and say what are some of the possibilities of investments there and what kind of activities can come up there, because there are a lot of skilled people out there. It is just the economic picture has changed and I think that some direction or some discussion around some of the impacted areas of our country might be important.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Two quick questions. One has to do with census preparation, the other is the Minority Youth Entrepreneurs.    Could you please talk about some of the budget problems we might be seeing a few years from now if the budget for 2020 census preparation activities were to be greatly reduced below the requested level for fiscal 2017 and what cost-saving innovations for the next decennial census might not be achievable under a greatly reduced budget.    And then the other question would be Minority Youth Entrepreneurs. The Department's request for the Minority Business Development Agency contains a new $3.6 million initiative focused on business innovation for young entrepreneurs. Madam Secretary, could you please describe the ways in which you anticipate this initiative will help enable young entrepreneurs to create jobs and spur innovation in the economy?    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And can you be a little bit more excited about this hearing, please? You can tell. It is just like Christmas Eve.    I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Dr. Elachi, and Dr. Lunine for joining us this morning to testify on this very exciting topic. And it is really an amazing time to be alive.    We are living for the first time in human history where we have the technological ability to actually seek out and find signs of life beyond Earth, and it is like science fiction. And here we are today actually discussing the NASA missions that will do just that. It is truly inspiring. And from the hundreds and hundreds of planets around distant stars discovered by the Kepler telescope, to the discovery of flowing waters down a crater on Mars, to the discovery of the prevalence of liquid water on at least half a dozen of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, the last decade has been filled with tantalizing scientific discoveries that are screaming for astrobiologists to go exploring. It sort of sets the stage for that movie ``The Martian''. And that is exactly what we are going to be doing.    Second perhaps only to my chairman is my excitement for NASA to forage out into our outer solar system and begin a series of missions to explore the water covered moons of Jupiter and Saturn, the so-called Ocean Worlds, and seek out the signs of life. It is time to have missions that are dedicated to searching for the clues and signs of life that may have evolved in these alien worlds.    Missions to Jupiter's Europa are just the first steps. Saturn's moons of Enceladus and Titan are also calling out to us as we search for life beyond Earth and seek to understand the potentially habitable environments of other worlds. And we are not talking about a one and done Europa mission, but instead a series of missions to the Ocean Worlds to probe their environments to see if it is habitable and potentially harbors signs of life. The extreme diversity and resilience of life on Earth has shown us that wherever there is water, organic compounds, and energy, there is life. Each of these Ocean Worlds have these three prerequisites for life and I guess we need to know does this mean life may have developed there? Or do we have neighbors? Or is there more to life forming than just having the ingredients as we understand them today?    I am excited to play witness as we journey out and see what bizarre and magnificent discoveries await us on Europa, Enceladus, Titan, and the Ocean Worlds. And truly for someone like me, who was here before television, when radio was just a crystal, that to go beyond the confines of this planet and watch these kinds of things unfold is really a privilege to be part of this process. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Elachi, what are the primary science goals of the Europa orbiter and related missions? And is astrobiology and biomapping part of the stated NASA objectives?    Mr. Honda. OK. So this may be the same question in a different way, though. So if life detection is one of these goals, how will all of this be accomplished by a potential Europa orbiter mission without a secondary mission or landers? And how likely are we to learn something from an orbiter mission that will affect what we would want to know with a lander, both guide where we would want to land and with what type of craft as well as the instruments to put on the lander? And then I understand for decades NASA and JPL have successfully explored planets and their moons through a three-step strategy of fly-by, followed by an orbiter, and then followed by a lander. I have heard this described in your testimony. Each step on this journey builds on the knowledge gained through previous missions, which you have explained. This is designed to maximize the science return at each step while minimizing the scientific and technical risk to spacecraft, landers, and rovers. With respect to a Europa mission concept involving a lander, what provides the confidence that we would know enough about the Europa surface to ensure that a lander will be placed on a scientifically compelling and safe site on the icy surface?    Mr. Honda. I know it is a lot of information, but I was just trying to put it all together so I can conceptually understand.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Through these discussions, I am sort of developing a picture in my mind that one of the things we want to do is to be able to understand through various techniques the possibility of life, whether it is through indirect or direct techniques. And also and prior to landing on the surface, it seems to me that we need to know how firm or what the structure is, so that it will sustain a landing. And then also, you know, inserting ourselves on a planet, I am a little concerned about contamination too.    So could you talk a little bit about the kinds of testing that needs to be done? And I know that you talked about handedness, that seems to be important, the issue of having ability through the indirect detection of what processes that you want to go through in order to see what is down there. And the types of techniques, I think I heard fly-through, plumes, things like that. Are these all necessary processes in order to determine whether the surfaces can enable a landing of a craft on the surface of the planet?    Mr. Honda. And could you explain----    Mr. Honda. Could you explain the difference and the importance of?    Mr. Honda. To the chair. The reason I asked about having this contamination connected to landing or fly-by or fly-through, whatever the term is, I was trying to figure out if he can determine the amino acid handedness through a fly-through, so that you have that information prior to landing. I mean, are there ways that you can do that?    Mr. Honda. I'm sorry, measure what?    Mr. Honda. Well, Mr. Chairman, not having that experience of hearing, is that plume created naturally or is that induced through, you know, creating the plume ourselves?    Mr. Honda. OK. Leaving the planet and coming back to earth, in your independent opinion, what is the estimated life-cycle cost of the Europa orbiter mission both with or without a proposed lander? And how soon do you believe a Europa orbiter mission could be launched and what assumptions must be made to support that launch date? And how long would inclusion of a lander delay arrival of a spacecraft to Europa? I think you alluded to that, including development time and transit time.    Mr. Honda. And development time and transit time, it is dependent on what our decisions are then?    Mr. Honda. I mean, the Chairman will be here more than 6 or 7 years, right?    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Honda. So I guess I will close with this question then. With that discussion then, it sounds like there is that possibility or have you thought about how we recycle the assets that we are already developing or we will be using, would that be recyclable and be able to continue to use as we seek out other solar oceans?    And I guess the other would be, should we be looking at building smaller fleets of assets, so that as we are pursuing this project we could be thinking about in a parallel way building smaller fleets to continue this search for ocean worlds that are out there?    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Honda. There has been some question about Earth science----    Mr. Honda. What I am getting from the last conversation was analyzing light and light sources is that----    Mr. Honda . Will tell you the kinds of composition of the atmosphere, because I know that planets do not emit their own light. So I was just trying to understand what we are saying here. Thank you.    Mr. Honda. There is no conclusion.    Mr. Honda. Well thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Administrator Bolden, and thank you for being here today. It is good to see you again.    Let me just take a moment to thank you again for the great visit we had a couple of weeks ago at NASA Ames. You and I spent the better part of a day together, for me an unprecedented over five hours. And that was really cool. And I really appreciate the effort the Ames family went to to accommodate the visit and highlight some of the amazing groundbreaking work that the scientists and engineers are performing at Ames in support of this mission, NASA's mission.    And Mr. Chairman, perhaps you and I can go on a tour of NASA Johnson down near your home in Houston, Texas. I have still been waiting for an invitation. But you know, I am patient. Perhaps we can all organize a trip for the subcommittee to Goddard or JPL. And I would love to meet more of the NASA family and see firsthand some of the other great work being performed around the country.    Administrator Bolden, as you know Chairman Culberson and I share the same passion for science and I love it when he starts talking about we are going to get you more money, we are going to get you more money. He sounds just like a great Democrat, you know? But actually this is not a partisan issue. It is about a national priority and moving us forward in the whole arena of knowledge and pursuing knowledge, that which we know and that which we are seeking. So this passion is also evident in last year's final budget that included the healthiest top line NASA has seen in many years. And I just want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that.    This year I am looking forward to building on our work from last year and continuing robust support for NASA and a wide variety of missions from exploring our neighboring worlds and probing the creation of the universe, to improving our understanding of our own planet and working with commercial partners to strengthen America's presence in space and supporting the burgeoning commercial space industry which is constantly growing. That being said, I share my colleague's frustrations with this year's proposed discretionary budget from the President that recommends scaling back our support for NASA by reducing NASA's discretionary top line by $1 billion. I will be more accurate, the Chairman said $1.3 billion. And so we are going to be working together on this. This is the time to be investing in NASA, not selling it short. At the same time, I must also urge my colleagues to support an overall level of non-defense discretionary resources that would allow us to provide a healthy budget for NASA overall.    Americans are really inspired by the successes and breakthroughs of NASA and our commercial partners, be it the amazing photos of Pluto captured by New Horizons, Scott Kelly's triumphant year in space, or the successful first stage landings of SpaceX and Blue Origin rockets. Americans are captivated by space and NASA.    Movies like ``The Martian,'' ``Gravity,'' ``Interstellar,'' tap into this public support and help fan the flames of support. And nothing highlights this more than the record shattering, as it was said, 18,300 applicants who applied to become a NASA astronaut last month. You said 14-point-what? How many spots?    Mr. Honda. Fourteen spots. I thought you said 14.3, and I was wondering who the 0.3 was going to be. And so what I will be interested in is if there is a way we can get some information on the demography of the applicants, who they are, where they are from, you know, all that sort of interesting, as an educator I would be interested in the source and where they were coming from.    So I look forward to hearing your testimony this morning and to learn more about NASA's programs and how NASA is going to capitalize on this strong public interest and create the most impactful and inspiring missions to both improve life on Earth and push our frontiers further out into the cosmos.    Mr. Chairman, thank you.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, maybe we can continue this discussion. This is the first I have heard of it and it is kind of an interesting question. But it is one that came out of right field for me. So we will talk about that.    General Bolden, as you know I am a strong supporter of NASA's Earth Science program, although not everyone in Congress is of the same view of NASA's Earth Science. Could you please talk about some of the ways in which NASA's Earth Science program benefits American private sector enterprises and the nation as a whole? And what returns are we getting on this investment? And in terms of the Agency's Earth Science portfolio, what role does airborne science play? And in the interest of the recent announcement of the Earth Venture instrument program and the use of CubeSat and SmallSat, what role do you see these two entities playing in earth science?    General Bolden. Congressman Honda, when I think about the value of earth science in the way you phrase your question, it has enormous both economic and strategic value. And I will try to give you a couple of examples. For example, we have the GRACE mission right now and SMAP. And I hate using acronyms but I will. I could read you the long name but it will not make any difference. But both of them look at water on the planet. GRACE uses gravity to determine the amount of water in reservoirs and underground aquifers and the like. And then SMAP is actually looking at soil moisture for its primary part. Those have provided useful information to farmers, to decision makers, particularly out in the west right now as they go through droughts. John Deere Corporation is working with us, looking at the potential to use GRACE and SMAP data in some of the work that they do. A lot of farmers today follow a model that was developed in Israel, something that is called drip irrigation. Where satellites feed data down to the ground, it goes into a computer, the computer says, okay, the ground is nice and moist today, do not need to water. Tomorrow the satellite may come over and say, it is really dry, you need some water. And the computer determines how much, and it turns on the drip system and it goes right into the root system of the plants or the vines if it is a vineyard out in southern California, you know, in the valley where most of our wine is done.    UAVSAR, since you mentioned airborne Earth obs, UAVSAR is a series of, it is a synthetic aperture radar that we can put on a number of NASA airplanes. And that has been used, it was used in the Gulf during the BP oil spill years ago. It has now been, we are trying to deploy it at the request of FEMA and the National Weather Service to look at levies and to look at some of the other structures in east Texas and Louisiana resulting in the floods, trying to help decision makers to understand what to do. So all of those things are the use of NASA assets for economic and strategic value. Not to mention Landsat, which we actually build Landsat for USGS, for the U.S. Geological Survey in the Department of the Interior. But it is through that 43-year program now that we have had the most robust land imaging system I think in the world.    Mr. Honda. OK. Thank you. Very quickly, the aeronautics program, as you know, is the first A in NASA. And it comprises the work that NASA has been doing for a long time now. But given the size of the program relative to other NASA directorates, it does not usually get the same level of public attention as other programs do. I would like to focus some attention on this important work. Can you talk a little bit about some of the ways in which the work of the aeronautics directorate and the funding that you are requesting for it, how can it help enhance our competitiveness in aviation, create jobs here, some of the other benefits that personally I am looking for, too----    General Bolden. Well as a former Marine Corps pilot, since I do not fly anymore, I am partial toward the first A, the big A in NASA, which is aeronautics. And I am very proud to say that over the period of time that I have been the NASA administrator we have taken a crawl, walk, run. But thanks to the committee, again, we have funding in the NASA budget. And the President is proposing in the 2017 budget additional funding that will allow us to get into our New Aviation Horizons program, a program that came about as a result of revamping our aeronautics strategic plan in 2014. And in looking with industry and academia at six strategic thrust areas that we want to do in aeronautics.    I think every member of the committee should have a little flyer like this, and I apologize that I do not have one of these for Europa. But we talk about Europa a lot and we do not talk about aeronautics. So that is why I chose to focus on aeronautics and I will hopefully get it to the students back here. But it talks real quickly about the New Aviation Horizons program whereby NASA, for the first time in decades, is actually going to be able to engage in building experimental airplanes again. What we call X-planes, but they are flight demonstrators.    The top ones for us right now, and it is just because industry is so far along on wanting to build a supersonic transport that the first one out of the chute is going to be the low boom supersonic demonstrator that will allow us to give data to the FAA so they can change the regulations that today prohibit supersonic flight over ground. Another one is hybrid electric propulsion. So that will actually save fuel, be much more efficient if you will. We are looking at a hybrid wing body. All of these things will help industry and we think it will help the airline industry, for example, to save as much as $225 billion over the next 25 years as a result of the work that we at NASA have been doing with the aviation industry.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Honda. Well that is the law.    Mr. Honda. Yes.    Mr. Honda. You asked him the question, Mr. Chairman.    General Bolden. You are not about to do that because----    Mr. Honda. We know what the law is, Mr. Chairman. The law and the process is: The President proposes and we dispose----    Mr. Honda . And that is the law.    Mr. Honda. Mr. Chairman, that is the----    General Bolden. That was my one--you asked me for one thing that the Congress--that the Authorization Committee could do. The Authorization Committee--should I be quiet?    Mr. Honda. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I want to go back a little bit on my questions on--that deals with Europa and the astrobiology missions in our solar system. Two weeks ago we had the pleasure, through Chairman Culberson's leadership, of hosting a very interesting hearing on exploring the water worlds of our outer solar system. It started with the Jovian moon of Europa. I am also very pleased that the Science Mission Director had recently recognized other water worlds, including Enceladus, with potentially interesting astrobiology, and opened a New Frontiers competition to look into exploring these worlds, as well.    As part of the discussion with Dr. Elachi and Dr. Lunine, we heard that signs of life and searching for planetary habitability--see, I can say that word today; I fell over that word last time--for life are two different things. We heard that a planned orbiter and potential lander will analyze habitability of Europa, which is quite different from detecting life or signs of life.    So, does life impact your--is searching for signs of life a goal of the Europa orbiter mission and what would be required to actually search for life and not just for habitability, but with the orbiter?    General Bolden. This is out of my league, but as I understand it, when we search for signs of life, like the James Webb Space Telescope will help us do, in a lot of the exoplanets and planets orbiting other suns in other solar systems in other galaxies, we are looking for the basic constituents of life, something that could produce microbes, oxygen, hydrogen, potassium. We can do that remotely, but when you are searching for life, itself, there is nothing like, as the chairman says, putting a lander down there and having them go out and touch and feel and get a sample. And is that really a microbe or is that just a disparate collection of the components of microbial life?    So, when people ask me all the time, why don't we just do robotic exploration? Robotic exploration is great, but at some point, you need to put a human into the environment so that we can determine whether we are looking at disparate pieces of life or whether we are actually looking at life, itself.    Mr. Honda. Does that have to do with--I guess what I heard your term was----    General Bolden. And the disclaimer I made, Mr. Honda, was I do not know what I am talking about. You know, I am telling you what my chief scientists and others tell me.    Mr.  Honda. Being a science teacher, though--because a lot of times it is better for me to learn how to ask a question and not know the answer.    General  Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr.  Honda. But this whole term handedness of amino acids, is that part of the effort to look at, perhaps other kinds of missions or concepts for the--to get engaged in?    General  Bolden. You talked about earlier, you and Mr. Kilmer, talked about CubeSats, MicroSats and the like, concepts for the future. When you talk about both, looking for signs of life in and evidence of life are, for example, on future missions to Europa or Enceladus or some of these other moons that have the geysers, the geyser activity, is to fly, you know, a SmallSat or a CubeSat through a geyser where it gets wet. That will tell you whether there is life there.    And, you know, when we talk about future Europa missions, that is what you would hope you will do. You get the guys out of JPL started and they can tell you all kinds of stuff, but it doesn't happen overnight, the way that they sometimes would like to have us believe. It is a slow----    Mr.  Honda. A lot of discussions around that and when we did talk about geysers, it was clear that there were natural-occurring geysers and then there is a--we can impose or create geysers through impacts. Is that something that----    General  Bolden. I will have to take that for the record, Mr. Honda.    Mr.  Honda. OK.    General Bolden. You know, one of the reasons we want to do a very serious study of Europa, for example, with orbiters is because we believe it will take us two years to completely map the surface. You know, you don't do one orbit and you are happy; it is probably two years.    Mr. Honda. Sure.    General Bolden. And that way, we will be able to find out where is the ice thickest? Where is it thinnest? Where is it most like will to--if you are going to artificially try to produce an opening for water to come up, where is it most likely able to do that?    Mr. Honda. Yes.    General Bolden. The other thing about Europa that is, at least I think I understand this, is that some other moons, some of the other icy moons have geysers with regularity, that are predictable. So, you know, you can schedule when you are going to fly through that. And we haven't had--to my knowledge, we haven't had that benefit from Europa yet. You know, we see them sometimes, but we don't--they don't occur with regularity like Old Faithful out in Yellowstone. Is that where Old Faithful is?    Mr. Honda. Well, and another way of looking at future funding and how we could look at robust funding and take advantage of the kinds of things that we develop at NASA, the term technology transfer is something that is very important----    General Bolden. Yes.    Mr. Honda . In terms of what we do, and as in how this could be--this technology transfer could be commercialized into the commercial arena. So, you know, taking these kinds of technologies and transferring them can provide a lot of jobs and a lot of activities, sometimes beyond what we really would be able to imagine.    Can you talk a little bit about the Technology Transfer Program and explain to me the funding levels that have occurred over time; will this decline or remain the same? It appears that it is declining, and it seems like this is something that we really should be paying attention to, to make sure that we really do, plus-up with the kinds of investments we make in research and development at NASA.    General Bolden. I will take it for the record to get you specific numbers, but I seem to recall that when you look at what we are doing now to measure our effectiveness in technology transfer, for example, the Office of Chief Technologist and the science technology--the Space Technology Mission Directorate, between the two of them, we now have a technology transfer database so that we can go in and we can see which technologies have made it to the--into industry or academia or into entrepreneurs.    One of the global ideas about the success of technology transfer is our Spinoffs books that we produce every year, that lists thousands of technologies that have been spun off from work that NASA has done, but that is not a sufficient way to be able to track, to give you metrics on your technology transfer. So, the fact that we have produced this database and that we now keep it better than we ever did before leads me to believe that we are putting more money into technology transfer. But I will get you the data. I will take that for the record.    Mr. Honda. This will be the last part of this question round. It seems to me the kind of wealth that we can realize from technology transfer should be something that we should track because it gives us a sense in the future that the investment we are making now will pay off in the long run; not only for the projects that we are planning for, but for the general economy of our country.    And if that pencils out the way I think it should, there should be more attention being paid, as the chairman would like to see, on the kinds of things that we do. It enhances our life. It enhances the quality of your life and it probably provides a lot of different kinds of aspects that we haven't even thought of, and it takes Moore's Law a little further out.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman--oh, Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to give you this. It is something that reminds me of my visit to     Mr. Honda. I think it sits on one of the things that we are looking at.    Mr. Honda. Thank you.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.    Two things. When we were at NASA we visited a gadget into which we climbed, it is called the Arc Jet. And the function of that is to determine pressure andtemperature of reentry of capsules and missiles, for that matter. And I understood that is probably the most unique piece of equipment that we have, but it isalso that we are far behind in keeping it up and maintaining it.    And I just wondered whether if these Arc Jets are not capable of recreating the actual temperature and pressure that we anticipate, then how are we going to be able to ensure that that facility will be upgraded so that the return will be safe for reentry of our astronauts in the capsule.    General Bolden. Mr. Honda, you give me an opportunity to talk about something that is near and dear to my heart. The Arc Jet about which you speak, in basic terms, it is a wind tunnel. And it is a wind tunnel that we generate incredible heat inside it.    Mr. Honda. Ten thousand degrees.    General Bolden. So we are looking at thousands of degrees. And we are looking at the ability of a nose cap, for example, or something, the nose of a missile, to be able to withstand the heat and pressure of reentry.    The upgrade on the Arc Jet facility comes under a portion of our budget that is called Construction of Facilities and Environmental Compliance and Restoration, and that just happens to be a part of the budget that both the Congress and the Administration like to use as a bank to which they can go. So I would say when----    Mr. Honda. Could you say that again?    General Bolden. I have used the term bank. It is a place----    Mr. Honda. It is a fund that we go to.    General Bolden. It is a fund that everybody likes to go to because it is, quote-unquote, ``not important.'' It is very important. It is because in that fund it is where safety and mission assurance, engineering, construction of facilities, upgrade to facilities is all book kept, and salaries.    And so when we take money from Safety, Security, and Missions Services (SSMS), when we go into that fund to take out a few million dollars, then what we have to do, what Mr. Eugene Tu out at Ames has to do is decide, okay, I am going to delay upgrade on the Arc Jet facility for one more year because I do not have the money to do that.    Mr. Honda. This has some relationship to our discussion about multiple-year funding and multiple-year procurement.    Multiple-year procurement requires that we have the funds so that we can lay it out there in the future for that one year's allotment. Multiple year means that, you know, we can have some certainty that we can have a budget that we can count on so that Dr. Tu will be able to keep this Arc Jet performing at a place where we can assure that the reentry of our capsules will be tested in an appropriate way.    And so I think that it is a small piece, but without properly maintaining it and keeping it up to date, we get to Mars and we come back, if we come back and we hit that atmosphere and that is the piece that is messed up, I think it would be, you know, that is the one piece that we have to really pay attention to, even though the budget may not be--it is a budget that we keep dipping into to say, oh, we will take care of it later. But, you know, if we want to anticipate astronauts coming back and not watching them burn up on reentry, then we have to take care of that regardless of what kind of funding mechanism we have.    So I just wanted to make that point.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Honda. And connected to that, we talk about commercialization too. There have been a couple of commercial cargo explosions. And what are some of the things that we are doing to make sure that when we do send astronauts up using commercial launches, what are we doing as NASA to ensure that those astronauts that we do send up are going to be safe and that their launches are going to be safe in two years?    General Bolden. Mr. Honda, just as we did from both, in fact all three, we had three cargo mishaps, we lost a Progress vehicle, we lost a Dragon, and we lost a Cygnus all in a 12-month period of time. From each of the accidents, we had NASA personnel who were part of the accident investigation team. We either did our own supplemental investigation in addition to being part of the team or in the case of the SpaceX accident, since they have a number of different contracts with us and they have ongoing launches, not just for space station, then we are constantly involved with them.    But in all three cases we were able to satisfy ourselves that we understood what the root cause of the accident was, that they were taking appropriate actions to ensure that that cause was taken care of, was corrected or remedied, and that we would be able to go fly again.    I think everybody knows, we accept more risk with cargo than we will ever do with crew. So we already, you step up your safety requirements, if you will, your criteria for a human-rated launch much more than you do for a cargo launch.    But we feel that we have the correct amount of insight and in some cases oversight with both Boeing and SpaceX right now to ensure--I will say Boeing, SpaceX and the Orion Program team, because they are all three the same in our eyes. We are going to have astronauts on all three vehicles and so they have to have the same level of safety and mission assurance, and we have to have the same amount of visibility into all three before we will launch.    Mr. Honda. And if I may, what role, if any, does Aerospace Industries have----    General Bolden. The corporation?    Mr. Honda. Corporation.    General Bolden. Aerospace is an FFRDC for the U.S. Air Force and they are--I have the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance and I think that Aerospace is in fact effectively the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance for the Air Force in most of their missile launches. I could be incorrect, but that is the way that I look at them.    And so we consult with Aerospace frequently, because with SpaceX again as an example, because both the Air Force and NASA use SpaceX, our Safety and Mission Assurance organization and our Office of Chief Engineer work hand in glove with Aerospace all the time, because sometimes neither of those three organizations has the sufficient number of people to cover everything. So Aerospace may cover something and debrief us, we may cover something and debrief them, but they work together all the time.    The present CEO of Aerospace, Dr. Wanda Austin, hosts a safety quality summit, I think it is twice a year. And Robert Lightfoot, who is the senior civil servant in NASA, he is the associate administrator or in a civilian company he would be called the chief operating officer, Robert attends that summit each year along with some of the folk from our Safety and Mission Assurance organization and the Chief Engineer's Office.    And so that there is constant interchange of ideas and experience with Aerospace, but they are not technically in our chain of command, if you will.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I have been learning quite a bit over the past few weeks. I would like to get some of your thoughts on the comments that were made about Space Launch System a couple years ago by a gentleman by the name of Chris Kraft, NASA's first flight director. He said that the operating costs of SLS, quote, ``will eat NASA alive.'' He lamented that while other existing rockets had become reliable through frequent use, the SLS will not achieve that level of reliability because, in his view, we won't be able to afford to launch it more than once a year, if that.    On the subject of future human space flight, missions to deep space, Mr. Kraft has also questioned why we cannot use our existing launch vehicle capabilities and put vehicles in space in pieces like we did with the space station.    So two questions. How do you respond to these sorts of concerns about the Space Launch System? And what is NASA doing to work with industry and Government partners to develop the spectrum of missions beyond EM-1 and EM-2 to fully utilize this enormous national asset that will be coming on line in only a few short years?    General Bolden. Mr. Honda, you know, Dr. Kraft is a role model and a mentor for me. He was my Center Director when I first became an astronaut and went to the Johnson Space Center. He is an incredible human being. From Virginia Tech, by the way. I did not know that until a short time ago. We always think about everybody comes from Harvard and Stanford and stuff. It is a pretty good institution down there in Blacksburg.    But his statement about SLS is, I think, and I cannot speak for Dr. Kraft, I think a lot of people's statements like that are based on how we operated when they were in charge or when they were around, that is a long time ago. SLS represents the best technology that we have today to leave the planet.    I think most people would tell you, we don't have a way other than chemical propulsion today to get off the planet, and we would probably always want to use something like an SLS. When you talk about the Europa mission, and while I am not making a commitment to you, Mr. Chairman, I want you to understand what I am saying here, SLS, it represents an incredible promise and potential not just to human space flight, but to scientific space flight.    You know, the reason we are all attracted to SLS for our Europa mission or any outer planets mission is because, you know, 9 years to get somewhere or 8 years to get somewhere or 7 years, that is a long time. The team, it is hard to hold then intact, you are paying for them. It is much cheaper if we can use, if it turns out that SLS is able to be used for a Europa mission, we are talking about a 2\1/2\ year mission. You know, that is 5 years we have saved in transit time, in salaries, in keeping a team enthused, you know, not shutting the vehicle down the way we did with New Horizons.    There are a lot of good reasons to do it, but that is not a commitment to SLS. I want to make sure you understand that, Mr. Chairman. You told me to make sure it happens, I am trying.    But in response to that, even if it is in the law, if I found that it were not the right thing to do, I would come to you and say, Mr. Chairman, can we review this policy, because that is not in the best interest of the American taxpayer.    So we are following the law and we will always follow the law, but sometimes things change and you go back and you revise the law. It is like our Constitution, that is why we have amendments. We find that the Founding Fathers were not the brilliant, maybe they were not as smart as we thought they were the first time around or something like that. I don't know.    Mr. Honda. Of course, based on history too.    General Bolden. That is exactly right. Yes, exactly.    Mr. Honda. I just needed to ask the question, just to clear up some of the questions I had in my mind.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Honda. And I think that the explanation is----    General Bolden. And I hope I answered the question.    Mr. Honda. No, no.    General Bolden. Because Dr. Kraft is----    Mr. Honda. No, I get what you are saying.    General Bolden . Way more brilliant than I am and knows this stuff a lot better than I do, but I have the advantage of a team around me that he didn't have.    Mr. Honda. Sure.    General Bolden. You have to remember, most of us forget, I have a very mature leadership team. When Dr. Kraft was in Mission Control and when he led the Johnson Space Center and we went to the moon, most of the people were 20 years old. They didn't know anything.    Mr. Honda. Well, that is the difference like between myself and my son. When I launched an airplane, it was made out of balsa wood and I pushed it off, he uses a battery now and he has got all kinds of things at hand.    So I just wanted some sort of clarification in my mind.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Honda. Thank you.                       Chairman's Closing Remarks    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And good morning, Dr. Cordova, and thank you for being here today. So I am really looking forward to your testimony and learning more about the great programs that NSF has. As a former science teacher and a representative for Silicon Valley, I know well the tremendous value that NSF has for us. And NSF is known as the great fundamental research venture capitalist for the United States. So NSF supports ideas and research that is on the cutting edge and often has no clear application beyond the pursuit of scientific knowledge.    By investing in a broad range of ideas you never know which ones are going to come up and pan out and end up having enormous implications for society and impact to our economy, such as the recent discovery probably changed a lot of rules in physics.    These breakthroughs then trigger commercial investments in R&D to develop an idea and bring it to market. This one-two punch of NSF investment in the fundamental research followed by commercial R&D investments in ideas when they have potential market implications is a proven recipe for success.    If it were not for the broad initial investment in the fundamental research by NSF, then this innovative cycle from lab to market would grind to a halt. The NSF is directly fueling our future innovative economy and is making sure that the next breakthrough technologies that lead to the next Silicon Valleys happen right here in the United States.    The thing about fundamental research is you never know which idea is going to end up becoming the next 3D printer or the next silicon wafer or the next new fuel cell or the next detected gravity waves. This is why the NSF needs the freedom to invest across all of the sciences without interference. It is critical that politics not be allowed to insert itself into the process and deem that some sciences are not in the national interest and therefore we will not invest in them. All science is in the national interest and all science contributes to an innovative environment from which the next breakthroughs will come. All science rises and falls together in a connected web and we in Congress should not constrain our scientists, our innovators, and our economy by arbitrarily choosing not to invest in certain fields. If we did that we would never have been able to help fund NSF on the gravitational waves.    The National Science Foundation is a direct investment in the future, strength, and vitality of our nation. Companies from my district, like NVIDIA, Google, Apple, and the Silicon Valley Leadership Group are taking it upon themselves to advocate for robust support for the National Science Foundation across all of the fields not just research that directly corresponds to their business. Because they appreciate that it is across all the environment that is innovative, fosters that web and that vitality through the NSF that feeds directly into the ideas and talented employees that their companies need to survive.    Our NSF model has been so successful that countries around the world from Germany to Japan to China have copied the model and are investing heavily in their NSFs. The world's economy is more and more dependent on innovation and as a nation we need to be invested heavily in the National Science Foundation and fundamental research in order to secure a competitive edge in the future economy. This is why I am also disappointed in the President's budget proposal, but in also ignoring the mandatory spending this budget only asks for a 1.3 percent increase. This is subinflation and is not enough. The world is investing heavily in fundamental research across all of the disciplines and so must we.    So I look forward to working with you and Chairman Culberson to find the money to fully support it, that sounds good, does it not? Find the money to support the NSF and continue to grow our innovative environment in the country. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And maybe that is what we need, take our subcommittee there on our next trip. And thank you again for being here. My question is last year we heard concerns from NSF, the National Science Board, and the broad science and higher education communities about Congress appropriating specific funding levels for each of the six NSF research directorates. Could you speak a little about this type of directorate level micromanaging and what impact does this have on NSF's ability to set priorities and fund the best science proposals? And then what would be lost if NSF had less flexibility within the research and related activities account? And lastly, how does NSF determine the funding levels for the six science directorates within the R&D activities account?    Mr. Honda. Excuse me. Decadal meaning every----    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Honda. Would the gentleman, Mr. Chairman, if he would yield for a second just to clarify the reason for my question, and it is a good one, because it is the pressure that individual policy makers may face also from----    Mr. Honda . The different communities, science communities, come to us first or, you know, lobby us before we move forward any issues on policy or funding. And if the scientific community can get together and do that among themselves rather than the industries, they can do it with the scientists, or if they do it with us I think it is like putting the cart before the horse. And it is an undue pressure I think that we do not need to have until we hear from the science community. That was the reason for my question. Thank you for that question.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Sergeant Friday.    Mr. Honda. I still remember Jack Webb.    Mr. Honda. Dr. Cordova, I think there is a lack of understanding about what sort of research is funded by social science directorate. Much of this research has an impact on issues as broad as national security, responses to major disasters, and strategies to save taxpayers money. And, briefly, can you give us some examples of ways that social and behavioral science funding is researching problems?    And let me hook up with the second part of my question. Geoscience funding is important to the training of many researchers in the academic field, I also understand that many industries in areas as broad as energy exploration, construction, and risk mitigation depend on NSF funded training for their employees.    Can you tell us about the importance of geoscience funding to the private sector? It is sort of a follow up on all this discussion about the directorate, but I wanted to break out the social and behavioral science and the earth science.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Honda. Let me just say this has been really interesting. I appreciate that. Dr. Cordova, advanced computing has played an essential role in powering science and innovation across disciplines and industries, and I commend the administration for pushing advanced computing forward through the national strategic computing initiative to ensure we have the next generation tools, and ecosystem needed to continue world leadership on this.    It is my understanding that the NSF plays a key role in this initiative, researching new technologies, training future developers and users, and supporting computing infrastructure to enable groundbreaking discoveries across science and engineering. What are your plans to ensure NSF continues to fulfill these critical roles as the U.S. moves forward in the next generation of advanced computing?    Mr. Honda. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Honda. The NSF makes awards for large projects, and awards are numerous sub-awards to the communities responsible for various parts of the project, and, the costs of those sub-awards are often the most significant cost of the project.    What is NSF doing to monitor such sub-awards to ensure that Federal requirements are being followed that costs incurred are reasonable, allowable, and allocable? And sub-awards typically constitute a substantial portion of award costs, sometimes as much as 80 percent, I understand. So when it conducts cost audits, will NSF commit to examining the costs of both the awardee and any of the sub-awardees?    Mr. Honda. I would appreciate that.    Mr. Honda. Thank you. Science has become very--as you have been explaining all this morning--have become very multi-disciplinarian in nature, and I believe the NSF recognizes that many of the proposal receives combine elements of multiple scientific disciplines. And when Mr. Fattah was here, he talked about neural research also, and it sort of reminded me that that is part of the social sciences in terms of how people think and they determine policies.    And I am just of diverging a little bit from my core, my question, but it seems to me that when we look at these kinds of things, and we look at our--the way we do studies, that it is important that we have women involved because if it is purely men, we tend to think in certain ways with certain structures and certain biases, if you will, much of it is learned.    And so having this diversity of thinkers and folks who are present makes a big difference, I think, in the total outcome. But in terms of the multiple scientific disciplines, can you give the subcommittee a few examples, particular where proposals combine elements of physical, chemical, biological, and computer sciences with social behavioral sciences?    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Honda. Just one last.    Mr. Honda. You mentioned NAPA and--thank you, Mr. Chairman for the last opportunity. But very quickly, I have been reading some articles for the past few months and there have been a number of examples of women in science coming forward to bring to life cases of sexual harassment by professors on women researchers. And the three basic questions as to what is NSF doing to combat such harassment in the research community? Should the NSF give grants to researchers who have been found guilty of sexual harassment? And can NSF do more to change this kind of a culture? And I know it is a very sensitive question, but I think it is a----    Mr. Honda. It is a situation that needs to be discussed, I think, publicly when we talk about everything else. We talk about diversity and women's input, and things like that.    Mr. Honda. I think that that reading, as sensitive as it is, I would like to know what your response.    Mr. Honda. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
