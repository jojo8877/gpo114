    Mr. Connelly. Thank you very much. And welcome, both of you.    Admiral Neffenger, let me start by saying I really appreciate the management reforms you have undertaken and the spirit with which you have taken them. This is a big enterprise, a difficult enterprise, a critical mission with a lot of unsatisfying aspects to the job. Very few human beings are going to make a 30-year career out of telling people to take off their belts and shoes, and yet it is critical to the mission, the security of the American people.    And so it not easy keeping motivated to have a salary structure that makes sense, and I for one very much appreciate what you have done, and I hope you don't leave with the new administration. And as a matter of fact, if you do, I hope you will give Paul Wiedefeld a call at Metro and join his team because we need the kind of management reforms you have undertaken at TSA.    One little plug that I always make, and I have seen in my own experience a big change, which I appreciate, in how we are treating the public, but we have still got work to do. But I have really been impressed at different airports I have gone to where--and I just think when you create a more hospitable, friendly climate that invites people's cooperation, you get it.    And there is always a risk if you get a hostile public or a resentful public that something can go wrong. Why not go the former if you can? And I just thank you for that, and I hope you will keep that sense of that culture present. We are not dealing with cattle. We are dealing with people, and we need their cooperation and we want them to feel good about the experience as much as they can.    And I think we do have a long-suffering public that gets it about the security mission and is willing to put up with a lot more than I would have guessed, but we should make it as easy as possible without compromising security, and I think that ought to be the ethos. And so I commend the two of you, and I thank you for the progress that has been achieved.    Let me first ask, by having said all of that, I think there is a growing concern as a management challenge what is happening in terms of wait times. So, for example, 600 passengers missed their flights in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Good Friday because of wait times that exceeded 3 hours. Now, Mrs. Maloney said she doesn't know anyone who complains. My guess is they were 600 people that day on Good Friday in Charlotte who did.    It is one thing to understand I am going to be discommoded and inconvenienced to get through a security line to protect me and everybody else. It is quite another that the price of that is it is moving so sluggishly and glacially I am going to miss my flight.    American Airlines says 7,000 of its customers missed flights in March alone, the month of March, due to long waits and security lines. Seattle and Atlanta have indicated they actually may seek authority to try to privatize passenger screening to expedite this process. Could you address that? Because I think we have to agree that is not acceptable. It may happen, but if that becomes routine, that just doesn't--now, we are going to get real public resistance.    Mr. Connelly. So we ought to be setting for ourselves a time frame that is acceptable. We don't go beyond that. And whatever the staffing required, I mean, Mr. Mica correctly talked about staffing to traffic.    Mr. Connelly. This is part of that.    Mr. Connelly. Well, you may want to check Good Friday in Charlotte ----    Mr. Connelly. And there is guaranteed follow-up?    Mr. Connelly. Very fine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
