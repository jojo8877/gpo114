    Mr. Bucshon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Whitney, the USEC Privatization Act assigned responsibility to the Department of Energy to dispose of depleted uranium, a byproduct of uranium enrichment.    Has the NRC worked with the DOE to develop a disposal pathway for depleted uranium?    Mr. Bucshon. OK. I don't have the date here. When was the privatization act? When were you first directed to that?    Mr. Bucshon. It is always surprising me in hearings where Congress has said to do things, like, 10 years before and we are still talking about it. But this may not be one of those instances.    Will the NRC's current Part 61 rule making affect the DOE's plans to dispose of depleted uranium at commercial disposal sites?    Mr. Bucshon. OK. And what would the effect of the DOE's disposal plans for depleted uranium--effect on the DOE's disposal plans for depleted uranium if the NRC decides to incorporate greater-than-Class C and transuranic waste as part of their Part 61 rule making?    Mr. Bucshon. OK.    Mr. Bucshon. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
