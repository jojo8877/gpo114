    Mr. GIBSON. I thank the Chairman, another informative hearing. I thank both the Chairman and the Ranking Member. Thanks to the panelists as well.    Help me better understand this piece here. I can imagine a number of factors why individuals would be turned down for a conventional loan. Help me understand a little bit better maybe with some finer resolution how someone sort of misses that but gets into your window, your eight percent, why that would be unattractive to a conventional loan yet attractive to the industry.    Mr. GIBSON. Thanks. Just to follow up on that, have you ever had for Funding Circle an independent audit of some kind, and are there any industry ratings in this field?    Mr. GIBSON. Any other comments from the panel?    Mr. GIBSON. I thank you, gentlemen. Your testimony has been helpful to me. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
