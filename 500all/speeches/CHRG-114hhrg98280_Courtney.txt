    Mr. Courtney. No--I waive my opening statement.    Mr. Courtney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you to the witnesses.    The title of the hearing is about game-changing innovations. And I think, again, we have heard a good discussion about offensive sort of game-changing innovations.    In terms of, you know, electronic warfare, in terms of hardening, I think that was the term that Mr. McGrath used in his testimony, our fleet, maybe you could talk a little bit about that sort of piece of game changing.    Mr. Courtney. Okay.    Mr. McGrath, I mean, you were sort of alluding to the same sort of innovation. It is not all about technology, it is also about, I guess, a psychological frame of mind. I don't know if you want to just maybe embellish on that.
