    Ms. Clarke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the Ranking Member, thank our witnesses for their testimony here today. I am glad we have had the opportunity today to talk about the Medicaid program, and how many people it helps across the country. As of February 2015, over 70 million people were enrolled in Medicaid. The number of enrollees will continue to rise, as 30 states have expanded Medicaid, and even more states are considering doing so. We know that fraud and improper payments have long been a reality of the Medicaid system, but with the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, we have made significant steps to strengthen the Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs by reducing waste, fraud, and abuse.    Dr. Agrawal, I would like to ask you about the Affordable Care Act anti-fraud measures, and how they have strengthened the Medicaid program. In your testimony you noted that the Secretary of HHS can temporarily pause enrollment for new Medicaid providers and suppliers if she determines certain geographic areas face a high risk of fraud. Dr. Agrawal, how does the Secretary make that determination?    Ms. Clarke. How have they been effective in preventing and reducing fraud in those affected areas?    Ms. Clarke. And has that been effective, in your estimation?    Ms. Clarke. And how does the affected states, during the moratorium period, how does CMS work with them?    Ms. Clarke. Yes, and on that point, how do you make sure that Medicaid beneficiaries are continuing to receive the services they need?    Ms. Clarke. And then, finally, ACA significantly increased funding to fight Medicare and Medicaid fraud. How will additional funding help CMS address program integrity vulnerabilities?    Ms. Clarke. Very well. And just out of curiosity, the implementation of the data hub, have you used that collaboratively in those high concentrated metropolitan areas as you also employ the moratoria?    Ms. Clarke. Very well. I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
