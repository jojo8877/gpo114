    Mr. Hurt. I thank the chairman for holding this hearing. This is my first appearance on this Oversight Subcommittee, and I can tell you I represent Virginia's 5th District. And I think that my constituents, if they were hearing what we are hearing today, would be bewildered. Perhaps not surprised, unfortunately, but bewildered by what we are hearing. And I guess a couple of quick questions for Mr. Montoya.    Where is Ms. Hernandez now?    Mr. Hurt. And Ms. Henriquez?    Mr. Hurt. A lobbying association, like--    Mr. Hurt. What about Ms. Gross? Where is she?    Mr. Hurt. Let's talk about CLPHA. It is actually called the Council for Large Public Housing Authorities, right?    Mr. Hurt. What is its purpose?    Mr. Hurt. Who does it represent?    Mr. Hurt. And so the employees of this organization, they advocate for policies that are favorable to these authorities.    Mr. Hurt. Also called ``lobbying,'' in the--    Mr. Hurt. So how long had Ms. Gross worked for this lobbying outfit prior to being engaged at HUD?    Mr. Hurt. What was she being paid when she was hired?    Mr. Hurt. Working for the Council.    Mr. Hurt. And so I guess my question is, is when they went through the process and she was denied initially, it sounds like that was voided, and then she was sort of hired on the side through this IPA. Is that right?    Mr. Hurt. Why was she hired? Why do you think that she was hired?    Mr. Hurt. Share that with us?    Mr. Hurt. What does that mean? What do you think it means?    Mr. Hurt. That was the--in the interest of the--    Mr. Hurt. --of the--and in the interest of those who pay to be members of this authority's--    Mr. Hurt. --Council, correct?    Mr. Hurt. So that was why she was brought in?    Mr. Hurt. And she was denied, based on that fact alone, from the ordinary hiring process?    Mr. Hurt. Is that how I understand it?    Mr. Hurt. You said that she was disqualified, or I saw on your report that you said she was disqualified.    Mr. Hurt. Disqualified.    Mr. Hurt. And so the concerns--what is it that dictates the concerns that the rules or the statutes in the subject--is it a conflict of interest? Is that the concern for why somebody would not be hired as an ordinary employee?    Mr. Hurt. A conflict of interest?    Mr. Hurt. Okay, so why is it that she could be hired as an--under this intergovernmental personnel agreement without concern for conflict of interest, but she couldn't if she was being hired as an ordinary employee?    Mr. Hurt. So when your office confronted Ms. Henriquez and Ms. Hernandez, did they tell you the truth? Did they tell you the truth about whether or not they had communicated with her in advance?    Mr. Hurt. Okay, so what does that mean? Did they lie to impede the investigation?    Mr. Hurt. Really quickly--my time is running out--but Ms. Perez, following up on Mr. Hills' question, I would love to get your thoughts on the differences between the hiring practices for an ordinary employee, Federal employee, versus under this intergovernmental personnel agreement. Why on earth would the concerns relating to conflicts of interest be different?    And my time has expired, so--    Mr. Hurt. Okay.    Mr. Hurt. Thank you.
