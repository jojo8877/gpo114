    Mr. Labrador. I yield back to the Chairman.    Mr. Labrador. I yield.    Mr. Labrador. Ms. Fennell, thank you for being here.    During your examination of BLM's bonding of wind and solar projects, did you examine the information in the two data systems, the LR2000 and the Bond and Surety System?    Mr. Labrador. In your report, you state that you worked with BLM officials to resolve data discrepancies. Were the officials you worked with familiar with how the two systems operated?    Mr. Labrador. Did the BLM officials you worked with provide an explanation for the missing, inaccurate, and out-of-date information in the systems?    Mr. Labrador. But if the data was inaccurate, how were you able to rely on their statements about what the data should be?    Mr. Labrador. Was it that the systems were not reliable, or unreliable, or was it that the data was not being input into the system?    Mr. Labrador. So what was their explanation for not inputting the data correctly?    You say the data was available. What was their explanation for just not doing their job correctly?    Mr. Labrador. Mr. Ellis, thank you for being here.    Are you familiar with the process BLM employees use to enter bonding information into the LR2000 and the Bond and Surety System?    Mr. Labrador. So how often is this information supposed to be updated?    Mr. Labrador. So who is ultimately responsible to make sure that the information is properly recorded?    Mr. Labrador. Are all BLM employees trained on how to use the LR2000 and the Bond and Surety System?    Mr. Labrador. So after the Inspector General found inaccurate bond information in the system, can you tell me what steps were taken after the report was issued to ensure that the information was properly recorded?    Mr. Labrador. And are they doing that? Has that been done?    Mr. Labrador. Thank you.
