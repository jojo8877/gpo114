    Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And I thank all of the witnesses for attending today.    Some have criticized the FSOC's designation process as being opaque. The GAO also made several recommendations to the FSOC to improve its transparency.    To your knowledge, how has the FSOC addressed the recommendations of the GAO? Would you also describe how the FSOC changed its process with the February 2015 supplemental procedures announcement? Anyone on the panel can answer. There are so many to choose from. Ms. White maybe?    Mr. Clay. Can you--oh, yes, sir? Go right ahead.    Mr. Clay. Thank you.    And what changes have you made to the annual and 5-year designation review processes to ensure more due process rights are available to companies? Mr. Gruenberg?    Mr. Clay. General Electric has announced that it would shed most of its financial assets which operated out of GE Capital. In making the announcement, GE noted that the company will work closely with its regulators and the staff of FSOC to take the actions necessary to designate GE Capital as a systemically important financial institution.    Further, the CEO of GE noted that, ``We have a constructive relationship with our regulators and will continue to work with them as we go through this process.''    Can you describe how FSOC will go about working with GE? Anyone? Yes, sir?    Mr. Clay. I see. Thank you very much.    And Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
