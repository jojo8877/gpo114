    Mrs. Torres. Thank you so much, and thank you for the opportunity to discuss this very important topic.    Just to follow up on your conversation, as a former 9-1-1 dispatcher I can tell you from personal experience that trying to get clearance to--as we are pursuing a vehicle, or our officers are pursuing a vehicle, trying to get clearance from an airport to follow a vehicle into that restricted zone, our helicopters are unable to continue that pursuit, but yet the media or, you know, folk from the ground can continue that pursuit through a drone.    That poses, you know--it is a very scary environment for those of us who live near an executive airport, for example, where our homes are very close by, and the--and these executive aircraft are landing--their landing route is right over our home. I thought, you know, birds were the scariest things that, you know, could face an aircraft as they are beginning to land, but now we have more and more of these drones that are getting in that way.    My question is really going to be to Professor Humphreys, and that is, in your prior testimony before the committee in 2012 you spoke of the use of civilian GPS and their ability to be spoofed or counterfeit. Can you tell me how technology has evolved? You know, what are the differences between then and now with older and newer models?    Mrs. Torres. Thank you. I yield back my time.
