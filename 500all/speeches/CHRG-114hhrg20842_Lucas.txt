    Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Madam Chair.    Mr. Wilshusen, let's talk for a moment about the magnitude of the fraud. According to your testimony, the IRS estimated that it prevented or recovered $22.5 billion in fraudulent identity theft refunds in 2014 but paid out $3.1 billion in fraudulent refunds. These numbers seem rather precise considering there's no range given. How does the IRS estimate how much it's prevented in fraudulent payments and how much has been paid? And how confident are you, I should say, on the accuracy of these numbers?    Mr. Lucas. Mr. George, fraudulent tax payouts ultimately hurt taxpayers because their public money is going to criminals. How confident are you that the IRS has a grasp on these estimates? And does this raise concerns about whether the IRS is allocating enough resources to combat the identity theft problem?    Mr. Lucas. Thank you, gentlemen.    Madam Chairman, actually, I yield back.    Chairwoman Comstock. And I now recognize Mr. Abraham for five minutes.
