    Mr. Barton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you and the Ranking Member for this hearing. Thank our two Commissioners, the Chairman, Commissioner Pai, for being here.    I am one of the advocates for low power television, and, as we all know, they don't have any real standing in this repackaging of the spectrum, if the mainline broadcasters give it back. But they do have a product. They have provided valuable service to the country, and I would like to see them helped in some way, if at all possible. So my question to both of you, we will start with the Chairman, and then Commissioner Pai, what can be done to ensure that we still have low power television once this repackaging is complete?    Mr. Barton. Right.    Mr. Barton. So you do see that there will still be a role for low power television?    Mr. Barton. OK. Mr. Pai?    Mr. Barton. Thank you. Thank the both of you, and with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    Mr. Barton. I will give my 2 minutes to Mr. Doyle. I had a minute 55.    Mr. Barton. If Mr. Doyle will vote for my bill----    Mr. Barton . To repeal the ban on crude oil exports----
