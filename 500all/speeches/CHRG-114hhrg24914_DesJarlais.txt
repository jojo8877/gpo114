    Mr. DesJarlais. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Bresch, I just wanted to try to get inside the mind of a large drug company CEO for a minute. When did you guys sit down and decide after 2008--you acquired the EpiPen--when did you decide to use this model of price increase, and how did you come to that decision?    Mr. DesJarlais. So you decided you should raise the price?    Mr. DesJarlais. And how much have you made over 8 years?    Mr. DesJarlais. No. I just said, how much have you made? You said you invested a billion dollars. You know how much you invested. How much did you make?    Mr. DesJarlais. So you know what you spent. Okay. Do you think that you are charging too much? Do you think $600 is too much, or are you going to keep raising the price?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. We'll get to that. But did you plan on increasing the price in 2017?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. But you did have a plan then to raise it every year for 5 or 6 years?    Mr. DesJarlais. I just asked you a question. Did you have a plan to raise the price every year for 6 years and then stop?    Mr. DesJarlais. You are obviously proud of your company. You think that was fair then to raise the price each year to that point, even though you got a drug at $100, which was probably too much for the drug, considering what the cost is. I know you made a fancy clicker, because I had one of your reps come by my office back in 2009 or 2010 and show me how to use it. So I know that cost a little bit of money. But, generally, when a drug goes to generic, doesn't the price go down?    Mr. DesJarlais. Only after you jacked it up to $600. It's like if I go buy this tie and they say it's $600 but were going to sell it to me for $300, that doesn't make it worth $300. You fixed the price on the drug and now you know--when did you know you were going to release the generic?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. But when did you know as a company? I mean, you knew it was coming. You've got a gentleman sitting next to you say it takes months, maybe years.    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. So we're supposed to feel good because you've taken a drug that you're overcharging six times what it's worth and you're going to drop the price to 300.    Mr. DesJarlais. Do you think you were charging too much at $600?    Mr. DesJarlais. Why did you lower it by half if you thought it was fair? If you thought it was fair, leave it where it's at.    Mr. DesJarlais. You're doing everyone a favor by charging three times what you acquired the drug for as a generic. If you're trying to make us feel good about that, I just don't. I'm not buying your argument. Do you have a guilty conscience about any of this?    Mr. DesJarlais. Well, if it cost 20 bucks, they could afford to buy their own. You wouldn't have to give them to them. But, instead, you chose to jack the prices up and then somehow make everyone want to feel good about you by saying how much you do.    The bottom line is you took a very inexpensive drug and you profited handsomely off it. And I don't have a problem like a lot of my colleagues that you can make money in a free market enterprise, but what I do have a problem with, as a physician, when you take drugs that are lifesaving drugs--and people don't have a choice. They can't go to a different department store to get their tie. They have to have that drug, because, you know, a mother would cut off her right arm to get that dose of drug. You decided to charge 600 bucks instead of cutting off her arm. And now you're saying you're dropping it to $300 and that should make us all feel better when, in fact, that's probably about 10 times what the drug should cost.    And I understand you got to make some money, but you can really sit there with a clear conscience today and say that that's okay and you just decided, because you're such a good company, to cut the price from $600 to $300? I mean, is that your testimony?    Mr. DesJarlais. Lower the price so they can afford it. Are you going to lower the price so other people can afford it?
