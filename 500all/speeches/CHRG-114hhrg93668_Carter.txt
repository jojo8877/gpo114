    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank all of you for being here. And thank you for what you do. And this is helping us out tremendously. So we appreciate your efforts in this. I want to concentrate just for a couple minutes on staffing because I am concerned here. Can you tell me how we are doing as far as new recruits go and are we getting new recruits in?    Mr. Carter. So you are acknowledging, then, that there has been a decrease in the number of new hires of people coming in?    Mr. Carter. But your assertion is that that was not caused by a lack of interest of applicants, but instead by the hiring process itself?    Mr. Carter. OK. All right. Hang with me real quick here. What about the force as it is today? Where are we at with our labor pool? Are we--what percentage will we see retiring in the next 5 to 10 or be eligible to retire? I am worried about the fact that we are going to get into a situation where we don't have enough Secret Service agents.    Mr. Carter. Would you say that the White House recognizes this? Because it is my understanding that the last budgets that had been submitted by the White House that Congress has actually put more money in there in order to address this scenario.    Mr. Carter. Well, for myself--and I suspect and I hope for you as well--one of the most disappointing things that occurred to me in this report was the low morale. I mean, how did that come about? Did these guys not watch these movies? I mean, man, they get you all excited about being a Secret Service agent. What happened?    Mr. Carter. Listen, that sounds--you know, I am a business owner. That sounds like a management problem. That needs to be addressed immediately. Well, thank you again for everything you have done. We appreciate your efforts.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield the remainder of my time.
