    Mr. Adams. I think in terms of the effect on the market so far, it is too early to tell if there has been a positive effect. We have heard many comments that people are happy that EPA has gone with subtitle D, but it is troubling to have that language in the preamble that they may want to go back and revisit the Bevill exemption. Again, they said it in 1993; they said it in the year 2000; they now said it again that coal ash didn't warrant hazardous waste management. But then they come back and say, well, we might need to revisit again. We need action by Congress to put an end to that chain of events.
