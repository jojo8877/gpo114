    Mr. Benishek. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you all for being here this morning.    I just want to make it clear about this bill, is there a preference in the legislation for students from a certain area or background or is every student on a level playing field in regard to these scholarships? Anyone?    Mr. Benishek. Does that mean that a person of color is more likely to get a scholarship than a person who is not of color?    Mr. Benishek. Does that mean that the scholarship, the question is, is there preferences based other than, to me, a need is a strong reason for a scholarship and as would be the desire to be in agriculture. But it seems like you are telling me that diversity, or there are some race-based rules for those scholarships. That is what I am trying to ferret out to you with these lines of questions, like Mr. King was talking about.    Mr. Benishek. Does anyone else have an opinion?    Mr. Benishek. Yes, I know.    Mr. Benishek. Let me go on to another question then, because several people mentioned this, and that was people that start at the university and yet drop out after a while because of financial issues, how often does that occur? What is the dropout rate after the freshman year, for example? Anybody have an answer to that?    Mr. Benishek. Is that a similar number to you, Dr. Jones and Dr. Bell? That seemed like a pretty high number to me, 35 percent of people are dropping out after the first year.    Mr. Benishek. In your opinion, is that more of a financial issue than an educational issue?    Mr. Benishek. It is not like they can't grasp the material.    Mr. Benishek. Right. I know it is very difficult to go back.    Mr. Benishek. I am out of time, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back.    Mr. Davis, 5 minutes.
