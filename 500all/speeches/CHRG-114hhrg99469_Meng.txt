    Ms. Meng. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and to our ranking member.    Thank you to our witnesses who are here today to testify on U.S.-India relations. I represent one of the largest Indian-American diasporas in Congress.    The people-to-people relationship has been a driving force behind bringing our countries closer together. Under this President, our countries have grown closer and we share renewed commitment to working together, particularly in the economic sphere. Principles of our joint commitment were laid out first in September 2014, when U.S. and Indian leaders committed to expanding and deepening the strategic partnership in a vision statement entitled ``Chalein Saath Saath: Forward Together We Go.'' Following President Obama's second state visit to India in January 2015, we released a joint statement outlining extensive, detailed commitment in a variety of industries.    But, while it is clear that there is a deep interest and commitment on both sides, there is still a lot of groundwork we must do to realize this vision. I look forward to hearing from you on how you see the status of this commitment from India and how we can best address some of the existing challenges.    Thank you, and I yield back.
