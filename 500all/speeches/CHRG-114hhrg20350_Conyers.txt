    Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Chairman Issa, and I want to put my statement in the record.    Mr. Conyers. And just note that today's hearing, with these particular witnesses, promises to be not only informative and timely, particularly with respect to China's enforcement of its Anti-Monopoly Law, and I appreciate your comments in that regard. And over the last days even, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, who was in China for the latest round of talks in the ongoing U.S.-China Strategic/Economic Dialogue, makes our discussion here so significant and important. I commend the Chairman for it, and I leave you with this one thought. What impact will China's alleged discriminatory enforcement practices have on American jobs?    And I thank the Chairman for his indulgence, and I yield back the balance of my time.
