    Ms. Bonamici. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Secretary Burwell. Your work covers so many areas that affect the daily lives of Oregonians and Americans. I appreciate that.    I want to thank my colleague and friend, Representative Stefanik, for bringing up the Older Americans Act. I want to ask you about the Home & Community-Based Supportive Services program that funds services like legal assistance, elder abuse and prevention, transportation and meal sites, medical appointments, referral assistance for seniors and their caregivers.    Now, I am supporting the additional $10 million in the President's request as well as many of my colleagues. Why is it important to increase funding for the Older Americans Act programs, especially the Home & Community-Based Supportive Services, given the rapidly rising population of older Americans? I do want to save time for another.    Ms. Bonamici. Keeping seniors in their homes, it is less expensive. Thank you. The Oregon Health Science University has been working in collaboration with Intel on genome mapping. That is especially useful in cancer research. The goal is to make personalized genomic analysis faster, less costly, more routine.    What are some of the challenges that research institutions face regarding the collection and sharing of information, and what opportunities might the Cancer Moonshot provide to overcome some of these obstacles in advanced precision medicine?    Ms. Bonamici. Thank you. I look forward to working with my colleagues on those important issues. Finally, I think my colleagues brought up the issues with opioid overdose and abuse and all the resulting deaths, and we have had an explosion in my State as well as the country.    I applaud your three-pronged evidence-based approach. Can you talk a little bit about the prong of improving prescribing practices?    Ms. Bonamici. Thank you. I know my State just received about $2.7 million to expand substance abuse services, particularly focused on treating opioid abuse. I know that is not enough. We still have more work to do.    I had a fourth question but the Chairman asked already about preschool development grants, and I look forward to watching that and hope the transition is seamless as the HHS continues to manage those grants.    I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
