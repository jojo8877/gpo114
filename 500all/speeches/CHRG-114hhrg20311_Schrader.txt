    Mr. Schrader. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. A couple of questions for Ms. Myers, if I could. You said that the current home health documentation requirements aren't working as needed. There have been a lot of denials that seem odd or problematic, to put it nicely. Could you give us some real-world examples of some of the ridiculous things you have incurred from CMS in denial?    Mr. Schrader. Very good. And as a veterinarian whose signature also is very illegible on a regular basis, yes, I think most people should assume that is the case.    CMS has apparently recently released a draft form, a little different new form documenting patient eligibility. I wonder how that compares to what the current form is and if you think that is a step forward?    Mr. Schrader. Very good, very good. Thank you for your testimony, and thank you for making the trip.
