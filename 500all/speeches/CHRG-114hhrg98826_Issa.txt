    Mr. Issa. Good afternoon. The Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law will come to order. Without objection, the Chair will be authorized to declare recesses of the Committee at any time. We welcome everybody to the hearing today on ``Triple Threat to Workers and Households; Impacts of Federal Regulations on Jobs, Wages, and Startups.'' And I will now recognize myself for an opening statement, having made an opening statement simply by reading the title.    To some people in Washington, it seems naturally, or even desirable, for the world to be governed by an endless, expanding web of integrate rules. Perhaps that is because Washington is a city of zealous policy advocates and lawyers, of which I am not one. A 2012 Washington Post article noted that law firms are flocking to Washington, D.C., for ``work centered around the capital's regulatory regime.'' There is no question that is true.    I am sure, when I ask each of you your professions, I will get two out of four as lawyers as a start. But I think, more obviously, this is a city of lawyers. This is a city and a region in which you cannot even get off jury duty by being a lawyer because they could not get a jury impaneled if they let lawyers off the hook.    There is a great distance, both physically and socially, between the regulators and the regulated. Regulators understand job impacts intellectually. They understand what they hope to achieve in the way of protection, but they often do not meet with industry representatives, but they are within the D.C. bubble. No one they know is going to lose a job because of overregulation.    Increasingly, there are two different worlds. Perhaps the insensitivity explains the current Administration's fanatic commitment to increased regulations, even as a recovery remains shaky. Each year since 2008, regulators have added more than $100 billion; that is a billion with a ``B,'' in new regulatory cost.    For 2016, the Administration plans 22 ``economically significant'' regulations, up 20 percent from 2015. Outside the Beltway, we feel the impact. A National Black Chamber of Commerce study found that EPA's ``proposed Clean Power Plan would impose severe and disproportionate economic burdens on poor families, especially minorities.'' No wonder Gallup recently found a near-record 69 percent of Americans named big government as the biggest threat to our country's future.    Regulatory advocates, of course, dismiss this. Instead, they focus on the aggregate employment. Factory workers may lose their jobs, but people in Washington assume they can find other ways to make a living: perhaps, go back to law school. And that just shows how much out of touch regulatory advocates often are, working here in the public world of Washington, D.C. Any count of the ``aggregate number'' of jobs also ignores the quality of those jobs.    Data shows that job displacement causes significant and lingering economic and physical hardship. Regulatory compliance jobs do not boost productivity; or another way of putting it is you never got a faster horse by putting more people on its back.    Moreover, as formal OIRA Administrator Cass Sunstein has argued, even if you are not convinced that regulations kill jobs, regulators need to be ``giving a lot more attention to that risk.'' Unfortunately, only 20 percent of agencies qualify employment effects.    Meanwhile, unemployment and underemployment are far higher than they are reported at any time, and particularly in January. We certainly see the U6 unemployment rate, which includes those workers who cannot find full-time work, stands at 9.9 percent.    Similarly, the labor force participation rate remains at near all-time lows. Many displaced workers have simply given up looking. Job creation depends on startups and new businesses. New businesses account for nearly all net new job creation, and almost 20 percent of gross job creation. Yet the U.S. has dropped from 12th among developed economies in terms of business startup activity.    Economists identify regulatory hurdles as one of the most significant influences on business dynamics. Today, ``almost 40 percent of U.S. jobs require a government license, as compared with 5 percent just one generation ago.'' It is worth examining root causes of this trend, and when Federal and State regulatory requirements serve as barriers to market entry.    In 2008, business deaths outnumbered business births for the first time in 35 years. Overregulation has wrecked the old economy. Now, it is suffocating startups. We have a unique panel of witnesses from old-line business, as well as the startup community, who can help us understand how deeply this problem is affecting our constituents. And I truly look forward to their testimony. And with that, I recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, for his opening statement.    Mr. Issa. Thank you. It is now my privilege to recognize the Ranking Member of the full Committee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Conyers.    Mr. Issa. I want to thank the Ranking Member for his well-thought comments, and would note that at this time, I ask unanimous consent that the Chairman of the full Committee's statement be placed in the record. Without objection, so ordered.    Mr. Issa. Additionally, I would ask all Members' opening statements be made a part of the record. Without objection, so ordered.    I would now ask, before we begin, for all the witnesses to please rise and take the oath. Please raise your right hands. Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you will give here today will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Please be seated. Let the record indicate that all our many witnesses answered in the affirmative.    Today we are pleased to have a distinguished panel of witnesses. From left to right, we have Mr. Paul Murray. He is vice president of operations at the Murray Energy Corporation. Murray Energy Corporation is the largest independent coal company in America. He has worked at surface and underground coal mines his entire career. His duties have spanned positions from laborer to vice president. Mr. Murray earned his bachelor's degree in mining engineering at West Virginia University and his master's in business administration from the great State of Ohio, Ohio State University. Go Buckeyes.    Ms. Janet Kaboth is president of Whitacre-Greer Company. It is a fourth-generation--congratulations, you beat all the odds--family-run company that has been manufacturing clay products since 1916 in northeastern Ohio. It currently operates a plant in Alliance, Ohio, that employs 80 people. During her over 30 years with the company, Ms. Kaboth has held roles in information systems, marketing, accounting, and strategic planning.    Additionally, Ms. Kaboth serves on various industry and community boards. She earned her degree in education at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, the alma mater of our speaker, Paul Ryan, and a master's in business administration from Baldwin Wallace College. And I will take just a moment to say, as a native Clevelander, you spent your whole live within a short drive of where I grew up.    Our next witness, Jared Meyer, is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. His area of expertise includes microeconomic theory and economic effects of government regulations. His work has been featured in various national publication and media outlets. He is also the co-author of a book, ``Disinherited: How Washington Is Betraying America's Young.''    Mr. Meyer earned his bachelor's degree in finance with a minor in philosophy of law at St. John's University, where he graduated summa cum laude.    Next we have Dr. Patrick McLaughlin, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, previously mentioned as apparently not a bastion of liberalism. His research has focused on regulations and the regulatory process. Prior to joining Mercatus, Dr. McLaughlin served as a senior economist at the Federal Railroad Administration. He has published in the fields of law and economics, public choice, environmental economics, and international trade and has testified before both the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as state legislatures.    Dr. McLaughlin earned his bachelor's degree in language and international trade, as well as his master's and Ph.D. in economics from Clemson University. Dr. Robert Weissman. Is it Weissman or Weissman?    Mr. Issa. Weissman.--Is the president of Public Citizen. His expertise ranges from corporate accountability and government transparency to trade and globalization to economic and regulatory policy. Prior to joining Public Citizen, Mr. Weissman served as director of the corporate accountability organization at Essential Action and as editor of the Multinational Monitor. He is widely published and has made many media appearances.    Mr. Weissman earned his bachelor's degree in social studies from Harvard University, and his J.D. again from Harvard, where he graduated magna cum laude. No slouch is he.    Dr. Bivens, you are last but not least. You are the research and policy director at the Economic Policy Institute, often called EPI. Your expertise includes microeconomics and monetary policy and economics of globalization, social insurance, and public investment. Additionally, you have provided expert testimony on issues before the U.S. Congress, as well as analyses for the United Nations and the Trade Union Advisory Committee. Dr. Bivens is widely published, including both books and articles, and has made various media appearances. Before joining EPI, Dr. Bivens was assistant professor of economics at Roosevelt University and provided consulting services to Oxfam America.    Dr. Bivens earned his bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Maryland at College Park, and his Ph.D. in economics from the New School of Social Research.    Again, I said it was a distinguished panel; it certainly is, and I thank you. And with that, I would only, as you might imagine, say with this large panel, would you please strictly stay to 5 minutes or less? The counter, little traffic light there, will guide you. Green, of course, means you may continue as quickly as possible. Yellow means you really have to go quick. And of course, red always means stop now. With that, we have our first witness, Mr. Murray.    Mr. Issa. Thank you, Mr. Murray. Ms. Kaboth?    Mr. Issa. Thank you. Mr. Meyer.    Mr. Issa. Thank you. Dr. McLaughlin.  TESTIMONY OF PATRICK A. McLAUGHLIN, Ph.D., SENIOR RESEARCH     Mr. Issa. Thank you. Mr. Weissman.    Mr. Issa. Thank you. And certainly you got a rise positively when you talked about patent trolls. Thank you. Yeah, there you go. Dr. Bivens.    Mr. Issa. Something for everyone. Doctor?         TESTIMONY OF JOSH BIVENS, Ph.D., RESEARCH AND     Mr. Issa. Thank you. I will recognize myself for some questions. And doctor, since your microphone is still close, pull it in, Dr. Bivens. My father-in-law was a World War II Army Air Corps pilot. He was a bomber pilot out of England flying over Germany, and I am sure that when the Fourth Air Force and all these others were rating what happened on a given day, if they sent out 100 planes and 99 came back, it was a good day. And if they sent out 100 planes and 80 came back, it was a bad day; but whether you were one of one or among the 20, for you it was a really bad day regardless.    So, when you gave the macroeconomics view, you really were not addressing what is happening to an 80-person employer in Alliance, Ohio, who after 100 years is being faced with essentially having to buy her company anew, almost, just to comply with the regulation. For her, she is being shot down, is she not? Or a coal company that effectively is losing all of its resources through retroactive regulation. So, for those two, there is an economic impact, is there not?    Mr. Issa. Yeah, usually here in Washington. That is true.    Mr. Issa. Again, those are the people on the horse. You know, it is one of those amazing things, is here in Washington, they always think that more people on a horse makes the horse go faster, rather than more horses make it go faster. And this is also a place where, as you know, there is more horse's asses than horses.    But it is absolutely amazing to me that everybody thinks a good job is a job sitting on the back of a horse telling the horse to go faster, not actually getting more horses to actually pull the load.    Ms. Kaboth, I am going to focus on you in my short time, since we are fellow Ohioans, and although I went to Kent State, so it is a little different curriculum. But----    Mr. Issa. ``If you cannot go to college, go to Kent.'' I know it.    Mr. Issa. We know that. And then, we even say worse things about some of our athletic teams. However, let's go through 100 years of your family's history. I assume you were making bricks 100 years ago, including some of them on Pennsylvania Avenue, as you said in your testimony. Materials you use substantially the same 100 years ago?    Mr. Issa. Okay. So, 100 years ago, you used coal. You burned it naturally, the way they do in Hanoi today. So, black smoke, it was pretty awful, no question at all.    Mr. Issa. And as you switched from coal to maybe cleaning up coal a little bit, and then ultimately to natural gas. Either way, your particulate count went down much cleaner, right?    Mr. Issa. Okay. And that transition occurred over many, many years, right?    Mr. Issa. And so, you made a decision to convert your kilns or to buy new ones at the end of a cycle, when you decided to reinvest, right?    Mr. Issa. So, the speed of new regulation at that time was one in which you were looking at changes in a way in which your company could meet those requirements and plan for them, right?    Mr. Issa. Now, you mentioned that recently, you upgraded some of your equipment, and you bought--made a large capital investment, and that that capital investment was somewhat based on existing regulations you were complying with. And now you are being asked to comply with regulations when in fact that equipment is still relatively new. Is that your testimony?    Mr. Issa. So, in your case, if I understand correctly, for the 4 pounds of mercury a year that your plant would put out, and correct me if I am wrong, that 4 pounds of mercury at a given production level is about the same 4 pounds it was 100 years ago, right?    Mr. Issa. So, we are not talking about a new pollutant. We are talking about something that was in place in the 1960's and 1970's when these laws were put in place.    Mr. Issa. So, after 40 or 50 years of the government having the ability to regulate, and after they regulated and caused you to make capital investments just a few years ago, they are now asking you to make another major capital investment: essentially, bet your company on new equipment to deal with something that is been around for 100 years and certainly for the 50 years, 40-some years of the Clean Air Act. Is that right?    Mr. Issa. So, your testimony today, if I understand it--and I just want to stick to your testimony because I have lived that life as a manufacturer--is there is nothing wrong with your wanting to invest in new equipment and reduce this. It is the fact that they want you to do it on their schedule, which is immediate, rather than on a reasonable schedule of compliance that gives you time to plan for and make those capital investments in the ordinary course of how people improve their business. Is that right?    Mr. Issa. Last question. The age of your equipment--what is--you said you had relatively new kilns. How old are they?    Mr. Issa. And I am going to close with this. You mentioned that it took you years to get the loan so you could begin getting a new efficiency level that would save, I believe, half a million dollars a year?    Mr. Issa. And on a $4 million payroll, that is a lot of money.    Mr. Issa. So, if the government really cared about the balance between your reducing CO2 emissions by taking $500,000 worth of burning of natural gas out versus this 4 pounds of mercury, they would actually be helping you get a low-cost lender loan so that you could reduce that consumption, would they not?    Mr. Issa. Sometimes we just miss Ohioans when we are looking for energy savings. Thank you. And I now recognize the Ranking Member for his questions.
