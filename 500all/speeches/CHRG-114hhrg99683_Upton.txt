    Mr. Upton. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    As we all know, 2 years ago, this committee welcomed a newly sworn-in Chairman Wheeler to this very hearing room. Our message then for the new Chair and the entire Commission was short and sweet: Given the FCC's jurisdiction over one of the most important sectors of our economy, the decisions that they would make would be critical to innovation, jobs, and our Nation's global leadership in technology.    And, today, our request is just as simple: In executing its functions, the agency must operate with openness and transparency for the benefit of American consumers and job creators.    Unfortunately, notwithstanding our clear and numerous concerns, the FCC has been plagued at times by process failures and a lack of healthy and honest policy debate. Ultimately, this has produced uncertainty in the market, harming our economy and the robust communication sector's ability to create the jobs that all Americans need.    There remains many significant matters to be decided by the Commission. These are opportunities for the FCC to get back on track, to demonstrate its commitment to process reform and return to the bipartisan policymaking that was once a hallmark of the FCC.    What you collectively do together matters to folks in Michigan and across the country, whose daily lives have been transformed by technology. And if the process can be improved, we will all be better for it.    I yield the balance of my time to Mrs. Blackburn and then Mr. Latta.
