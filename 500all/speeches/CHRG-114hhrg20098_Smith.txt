    Mr. Smith. The hearing will come to order, and good afternoon to everyone.    Among the potential partners in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, Vietnam is the only country that bans independent religious groups, the only country considered one of the world's worst violators in Internet freedom. Vietnam harbors severe child labor and forced child labor violators and regularly jails and tortures those who speak out for human rights, political inclusion, or the right to practice their religion. There are today over 100 prisoners of conscience in Vietnam.    Nguyen Van Dai spent 4 years in jail and 4 additional years under house arrest for defending religious freedom and calling for greater democratization in Vietnamese society. He was detained again and brutally beaten last December for continuing his work. His arbitrary detention undercuts any claim that the current Vietnamese leadership can become a trusted U.S. partner.    Prior to his arrest, I had the privilege of meeting with him in Hanoi at his law office at 10 Doan Tran Nghiep Street in December 2005. I was deeply impressed with his passion for truth, his defense of universally recognized human rights, his faith, his extraordinary courage, and his deep and abiding love for Vietnam. He is truly a patriot.    Nguyen Van Dai's wife, Vu Minh Khanh, is with us today to speak on his behalf and for the other prisoners of conscience in Vietnam. Her testimony is especially timely because President Obama will travel to Vietnam at the end of this month. A steady stream of State Department officials are going to Vietnam prior to the trip. In fact, the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Tom Malinowski is in Vietnam today.    The administration should not try to whitewash Vietnam's record prior to the President's trip, but must make absolutely clear and unequivocal statements in support of democracy and free speech advocates, disfavored religious and ethnic minority groups, and human rights defenders.    The unconditional release of Nguyen Van Dai and other prisoners of conscience should be a precondition of the President's visit. However, if the President goes without any conditionality, I appeal, this subcommittee appeals, to the President to demand the immediate and unconditional freedom and release of Nguyen Van Dai and the others.    I also encourage the President to meet with those in Vietnam who share our interests in democracy and human rights in Vietnam. Doing so will send a clear message about U.S. interests to the vast majority of Vietnamese, some 66 percent who were born after the Vietnam War ended.    The administration should also make clear to the Communist leaders in Hanoi that the further expansion of trade and security partnerships, the lifting of the arms embargo is unacceptable until there are significant, verifiable, and irreversible improvements in human rights in Vietnam. Unfortunately, for the past 7-plus years, the administration has failed to deliver such messages to victims of abuse anywhere. No tough message was delivered in Cuba, for example, despite an escalation of arrests and abuse.    The administration seems eager to proceed with lucrative trade and to lift the ban on lethal arms sales to Vietnam without imposing any real conditions. That would be a colossal mistake. The administration surely will justify extending these generous benefits by arguing that lifting the trade barriers and expanding diplomatic engagement with Vietnam will bring about human rights and other positive advances. Such arguments have long been discredited, however. In China, for example, or more recently in Bahrain, and there is evidence such arguments failed miserably in Vietnam as well.    In 2007, after the United States lifted its longstanding objection to Vietnam's membership in the World Trade Organization, Hanoi responded by launching the first of three waves of arrests that jailed more than 100 dissidents and introduced sweeping new laws restricting freedom of association, assembly, and the Internet. In short, Vietnam's WTO membership allowed the Communist government free license to jail, torture, and abuse. The pressure was off. Why would they not do so again?    The Communist leadership in Hanoi will take our benefits, our trade benefits, our security commitments, and continue repressing those seeking political reform and universal freedoms. The business of the Communist party is staying in power and repressing those who may challenge their power. They will not embrace human rights improvements or the rule of law, unless it is a condition of better relations with the United States.    Vietnam needs the U.S. markets and security commitments much more than the United States needs Vietnam's markets and security cooperation. The administration should demand additional protections for human rights, Internet freedom, and the rule of law as a condition of U.S. assistance. Not doing so is shortsighted, misguided, and fails to achieve long-term U.S. interests, and it throws the victims under the bus.    One way to send an important message about U.S. policy priorities is to pass the Vietnam Human Rights Act, H.R. 2140, which I have reintroduced in this Congress and is now waiting further action in the House and Senate. I would note parenthetically that past iterations of the Vietnam Human Rights Act that I have introduced in previous Congresses have passed the House four times, only to be ignored in the Senate.    The bill stipulates that the United States cannot increase nonhumanitarian assistance to Vietnam until the President certifies that the Government of Vietnam has made substantial progress in establishing human rights protections. The American people should not have to subsidize torture or underwrite the jailing of journalists, religious leaders, labor activists, or advocates of democracy, or Internet freedom.    The bipartisan Vietnam Human Rights Act will restore the right priorities to U.S. policy toward Vietnam. The Communist party is not Vietnam's future. That future lies with Nguyen Van Dai and many other advocates of political reform and human rights who seek our freedoms more than our trade. U.S. policy must send the unmistakable message to the Government of Vietnam that human rights improvements are fundamental to better relations, critically linked to our mutual economic and security interests, and will not, I say again, will not be ignored or be bargained away.    I would like to now introduce our very distinguished witness today, Ms. Vu Minh Khanh, who is the wife of human rights lawyer Mr. Nguyen Van Dai, as I said earlier, who was arrested in December, December 16 to be exact, in 2015 under article 88 of the Vietnamese penal code for ``conducting propaganda against the state.''    Since his arrest, Ms. Vu has been advocating for his release, meeting with international delegates, starting petitions, and giving interviews with various media agencies to raise awareness of Dai's case. She has volunteered at a church in Hanoi and has been doing so since 2009. The church reaches out to many vulnerable groups, including those who suffer from drug addiction, orphans, and youth. In addition to providing support and counseling to those groups, Ms. Vu also assists with the daily financial management of the organization and works to promote and protect human rights through the church.    I would like to now yield to our distinguished chairman of the full Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ed Royce.    Mr. Smith. Chairman Royce, thank you for your very eloquent and very strong statement and consistent support for the human rights advocates in Vietnam, and especially today for Nguyen Van Dai who is suffering again. He is back into prison, as I said in my opening. He is 4 years of prison, 4 years of house arrest. And without objection, a very, very, very well-written appeal that Ms. Vu made at the time of that first arrest. Without objection, I would like to make it a part of the record.    And I yield the floor to Ms. Vu for such time as she may consume.    Ms. Vu. First of all, I would like to deeply thank Chairman Chris Smith and also Chairman Ed Royce having given me this precious opportunity to speak.    My name is Vu Minh Khanh, wife of attorney Nguyen Van Dai. We both are Protestants, myself serving our church in Hanoi. Dai is a human rights defender now in jail.    My husband was first arrested in 2007, then sentenced to 4 years imprisonment plus 4 years of house arrest for violating article 88 of Vietnam's penal code for ``conducting propaganda against the state.'' My husband was disbarred and his law office was shut down.    After having just completed his house arrest, my husband was arrested again on December 16, 2015, and charged under the same article 88. My husband has been detained for almost 5 months now, yet I have not received any information about him. He has been held incommunicado and not allowed to meet with my family, myself, nor with his defense lawyers.    Twice a month, I am permitted to bring food to detention center B14 in Hanoi for his daily needs, but I do not know if he has received any. In fact, I honestly do not know if he is really held at B14 because in Vietnam the public security force can do whatever they want. If they transfer inmates, they do not inform the family members accordingly. For example, this has happened to blogger Dieu Cay, and currently happened with Tran Huynh Duy Thuc. Thus, if in fact my husband has been tortured physically and/or mentally, or given false information, I would not know.    My husband has not been allowed to receive a copy of the Bible, a gift from the U.S. Ambassador, Mr. Ted Osius.    Specifically, 10 days before his arrest, he was attacked and severely injured following a human rights training session for about 60 people in Nghe An Province, about 300 kilometers from Hanoi. Having been attacked 10 days prior, his injuries had not healed. He was then arrested on December 16.    Throughout his human rights activism, my husband was constantly followed, threatened, harassed, and beaten. Each time Dai was attacked, it related to his work because the government did not like it and had requested him to stop doing human rights work. However, my husband believes that his activities are within his rights under the Vietnamese Constitution and international law. Because the police constantly follow my husband all day, I believe that the Vietnamese Government would know clearly who attacked him. However, the government has claimed that they do not know who the assailants were when my husband filed a complaint.    My husband accepted the high risks that comes with these activities. And in fact, this is the reality that human rights activists in Vietnam have to face constantly.    My husband also has hepatitis B. Therefore, I am very worried about his health condition.    My husband experienced democracy initially in Germany, having witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall. He then returned to Vietnam and studied to become a lawyer. In 1997, my husband ran for the National Assembly with the hope that he could speak up for the people. In 2000, my husband officially began his activism and fought for freedom of religion.    The first human rights case my husband took was in 2000 when he defended a member of the Protestant church who was brought to court because she tried to stop the police when they came to disband a prayer service at the local church.    Thereafter, my husband provided free legal services to the Christians who were oppressed based on their religion, those who fought for democracy and human rights who are harassed and detained, victims of land grabs, or home loss, and to people who were physically attacked and arbitrarily detained. He also led training courses about human rights at his law office.    Since he started his activism in 2000, aside from the 4 years he was imprisoned and right upon his release, my husband immediately continued to raise his voice to protect human rights, even when he was still under house arrest. And he always fervently tried to fight for freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly through nonviolent methods and through providing education on human rights. My husband always focused on empowering the youth and helped many students who are human rights activists.    He started classes on human rights for different people within society and wrote articles on the rule of law. My husband usually worked with many others and connected organizations with each other within the country. He also advocated with foreign governments, as he had a good working relationship with many Embassies in Vietnam and government officials from around the world.    Regarding my husband's arrest in 2007, the police arrested him at his law office while he was teaching a class on human rights to his students. The topic of the class was based on a book on civil society which the American Embassy in Vietnam had published.    As for his arrest this time, it was while my husband was leaving the house to meet with the delegation from the European Union who were in Vietnam for the annual European Union-Vietnam human rights dialogue.    My husband is currently facing from 3 to 20 years imprisonment.    He has worked hard to protect human rights, and these activities cannot possibly be seen as criminal. Therefore, I hope that Congress and the U.S. Government, especially President Obama on his trip to Vietnam, will help demand for his immediate and unconditional release.    I sincerely thank you for spending time to listen to my husband's case. Respectfully.    Mr. Smith. Ms. Vu, I would like to thank you for your absolutely compelling testimony that will be heard by many in America and hopefully around the world. As you have been telling your story, I am glad that other news outlets have not only carried your op-eds and your very profound words and sentiments, but know that the Congress as well is listening and listening very carefully.    I want to thank C-SPAN for being here so that a larger American audience will get to hear you and to realize that things are horrific for your husband.    I do have a couple of questions. And I would like to thank Dr. Binh Nguyen for doing the translation today for us. Deeply appreciate that. And for your advocacy as well.    I have a couple of questions. You know, you point out in your testimony that your husband was arrested this second time as he was leaving the house to meet with the delegation from the European Union who were in Vietnam for the annual EU-Vietnam human rights dialogue.    First of all, I believe that dialogues are essential, but they should not be seen as a substitute for very significant, tangible impacts and consequences to countries like Vietnam, the Government of Vietnam, that commits egregious violations of human rights against its own people. Dialogue is great. We need to talk. No one is ever suggesting that talk needs to be suspended. But it needs to be linked to real consequences in the real world, like the lifting of an arms embargo, like greater trade, and other kinds of interactions between the two governments.    I am wondering if any of the members of the European Parliament who were here for that dialogue have raised their voices in support of your husband after he was arrested, again, en route to meet with them to dialogue with him about what the government is doing on human rights in Vietnam.    Ms. Vu. My husband did not meet with the EU delegation and I am not sure what would have transpired between them. But I do know that after his arrest, they actually contacted me and met with me and showed a lot of support.    Mr. Smith. That is so extremely important. This is a united world, not just the United States speaking about these universally recognized human rights.    I would hope as well, as you point out in your testimony, that the continued gross mistreatment of your husband and others would become the subject of the Human Rights Council, the U.N. Human Rights Council, where Vietnam sits in a place of dignity as a member of that council. It is breathtakingly disturbing that an abuser of human rights could simultaneously be an arbiter of how well or poorly other countries are doing. First, fix your own house and get that in order. So I think we need to press the case there as well.    Let me ask you, if I could, about how you have been treated by the authorities. You mentioned in your testimony that an attempt for his defense attorneys to get certificates has not been allowed. Could you further elaborate on what that process is all about and how you yourself have been treated when you advocate on behalf of your husband?    Ms. Vu. So in short, after his arrest when I hired three lawyers, they were not able to meet with Dai, nor able to proceed with any legal actions for his case, to prepare for his case. Because article 88 falls under a national security law, Dai has been denied the right to see his lawyers.    As for myself, I noticed that there is a camera constantly in front of my house following all my activities. I have tried to visit my husband and always denied to see my husband when he is incommunicado. In addition, I have requested to be able to bring him the Bible or have visitation rights, and/or for other family members to visit him, but all have been denied. I have written complaints, but I have not received any verbal or written response from the government.    Mr. Smith. Can you tell us, to the best of your knowledge, how your husband was treated when he was imprisoned the first time? Obviously 4 years in prison followed by 4 years of house arrest. What were the prison conditions like?    Ms. Vu. To complete my previous statement, the harassment puts a mental stress on me. I know my husband has hepatitis B and was beaten severely prior to his arrest. I am constantly worried about him, not being able to see him, as he is incommunicado. In 2007, he was put in a very small cell with 60 other inmates. Their water was so contaminated with soil and trash that they had to use their socks to filter the water. In addition, there was a lot of harassment from the prisoners in the same cell. There is also a lot of stress with constant observation and surveillance from the government during his jail time.    Mr. Smith. You mentioned that he was beaten by thugs in the taxi, or when he was cornered, and that there were--they beat him around the face. Were his teeth broken? Did it require stitches? Did he get any kind of medical attention?    Ms. Vu. On the day of Dai's arrest, approximately 30 security officers stormed our house, giving no specific evidence or reason for their actions. During the beating, my husband had suffered a lot of beating to the face, especially sustained hemorrhage to the eye globes. He was undergoing some evaluation, then he was arrested. In addition, his body was covered with bruises all over.    Mr. Smith. Has the American personnel at Embassy Hanoi been helpful? Have they tried to visit him? Have they been allowed any access to him? Have they even made the attempt?    Ms. Vu. Immediately after his arrest, I was invited to the private residence of U.S. Ambassador Ted Osius, and he gave a lot of support and comfort. Especially, he also gave me a Bible to give to my husband while he is imprisoned. However, when I brought the Bible, it was denied so my husband never received the Bible. In addition, the Embassy has mentioned that I could meet with them at any time.    Mr. Smith. Let me just make a couple of final observations and ask if you have anything further you would like to say. I can assure you we will continue our efforts. I see Dr. Thang from Boat People SOS is here today.    I met, as I mentioned earlier, your husband in Hanoi on a human rights trip in 2005 at his law offices. And even though he spoke glowingly about his vision of a Vietnam where everyone possessed fundamentally recognized human rights, universally recognized human rights, there was a total absence of malice on his part toward the people in the government.    When I hear that the government, as you have pointed out, has cited article 88 of Vietnam's penal code, conducting propaganda against the state, I was with him privately. As a matter of fact, some of the people who were en route were detained and were not allowed to go to his law office that day to meet with me. But there was no propaganda against the state. There was a love for the Vietnamese people that was very deep and very profound, and I was almost speechless how he could have endured so much, known about so much wrongdoing, and yet he spoke about human rights in the purest of terms and had such a clarity of purpose about him.    And so the Vietnamese Government needs to know that we are inspired by Nguyen Van Dai, and growing numbers of members of parliaments, congresses will rally to his defense. And your testimony has sent a clear message to the world, not just at this venue, but everywhere else where you have spoken. How can the government do what they are doing to your husband who only desires the best for the country of Vietnam?    So I want you to know that you have been an inspiration and he has been an inspiration. When I met with Mr. Dai, again with Dr. Thang, a year later here in my office, again I was touched by that absence of malice. He did not engage in tirades against Vietnam or its government. He spoke about defending human rights and caring for the disenfranchised, the people of faith, which I found just incredible. And I do hope that that is not lost.    There are always reformers in any dictatorship or in any repressive government. They need to know, when he is away from them, when he is talking to Members of Parliaments or Congresses in his office or in Washington, his message was one of hope for the people of Vietnam. So I want you to know what an inspiration your presence here is today.    If President Obama were sitting here where I am sitting, or if the Prime Minister of Vietnam was sitting here, what would you say?    Ms. Vu. If the President were sitting here in front of me, I would plead with him to help the people of Vietnam. When he fights for human rights in Vietnam, he helps the people. The people of Vietnam have suffered a lot through all these years of war, and now if the President could help to promote human rights in Vietnam, that is what I ask for.    The reason they arrested my husband, and now I am asking for his release while the President is there, is because he represents a symbol of nonviolent fighting for human rights and democracy in Vietnam, and that is why his release would be crucial for the people of Vietnam and that would also be symbolic of the President's support for such movement in Vietnam.    And as you have requested, I have just a few more points to add, please.    I would like to present to you, Mr. Chairman, and also the U.S. Congress, that I would like to plead the case of my husband. I did not understand why he was arrested under the penal code article 88 when he is a human rights activist for nonviolent movements. And also, when they came to the house, they took away the civil society publication that was put out by the U.S. Embassy in Vietnam. They also took away any materials that my husband has from the United Nations Human Rights Council, even the symbol of the dove, which my husband believes it represents peace and nonviolent movement for human rights. They took everything, envelopes, papers, anything that has that symbol on it.    And then one particular thing that I would like to point out is all the T-shirts that has the words ``Hong Kong Today, Vietnam Tomorrow,'' were also confiscated as an artifact to be used against my husband.    To share with you my thoughts why I am here, and first thank you so much for holding this hearing. This is very important. It is because back in 2007, I had written over hundreds of complaints to the President, Prime Minister, Secretary General, National Assembly leaders, various ministries, the court, investigative units, and news outlets and never heard anything back. This time I have tried the same, written many complaints, and also visited many of the agencies just to try and see if anyone would respond to my request. None of them had responded in any way verbally or written to me. And I have met with a lot of obstruction and ignorance from these agencies.    In addition, I felt that if I would go outside at my own risk and raise this voice to the world, then I would be able to present my husband's case so that more people would know about the situation in Vietnam. And my husband is just one of the many people who are in a similar situation.    Just to recount what happened in 2007, the lawyer only had 7 days to prepare for his trial back then. Specifically, when I went to the investigation unit, they had sent the papers to the judicial office, but there was no clear evidence against my husband at that time. So, in fact, I am very worried about similar situation this time.    I am really worried that if that repeats, that the lawyers for Dai only have a few days just like the previous time, then there will not be enough time for them to prepare the trial for Dai.    So I would like to request that my husband be released unconditionally and immediately. But in case he does go to trial, I really want a fair trial, and also for his lawyers to have the time to prepare for his case.    Thank you, Chairman Smith, for holding this hearing. Please accept my deep gratitude, and also to all the staff members who have made this possible. I really appreciate all of your caring and support throughout this very difficult time for myself, my husband, and my family.    I would like to know as a request whether, Mr. Chairman, together with other Members of Congress, could write a letter to President Obama asking for his response, first to this hearing and also to other requests that have been put in my statement previously. Thank you.    Mr. Smith. Ms. Vu, thank you. We will be more than happy to send your statement and a letter encouraging the President and appealing to the President to raise your husband's case and that of other prisoners of conscience in a specific fashion. Not an oblique mention in a wind-up statement or some generality. There need to be specific requests made so that we can gauge whether or not Vietnam is about to move in the right direction or continues its deterioration when it comes to human rights.    There are a number of areas where human rights violations are worsening. Human trafficking. Religious freedom. And the administration could today designate Vietnam as a CPC country, Country of Particular Concern. The facts warrant it. And they also could be known as a Tier 3 country when it comes to egregious violations of sex and labor trafficking, especially labor trafficking in Vietnam. So the President has tools in his toolbox, the President of the United States. We hope that he uses them.    We will send, as per your request, your testimony and your strong appeal backed up by our strong appeal. We will do it immediately. And again, I hope the President is specific. Just some general statement about human rights doesn't cut it. It hasn't in any other country around the world. It hasn't in Vietnam. He needs to be specific.    So I want to thank you again for your very brave testimony. Thank you for your husband's tremendous personal sacrifice for the cause of Vietnam human rights and religious freedom. He is a truly remarkable man, as are others who are fighting this battle with nonviolence and with faith. Know that our prayers are with you and with him. We are in solidarity with him, I can assure you.    And I would like to note for the record that we will be having a follow-up hearing to this hearing in mid June, latter part of June, the 22nd or so. And we will be assessing the President's trip and whether or not any progress was indeed made.    So again, I want to thank you so very much for your testimony. And, Dr. Binh Nguyen, thank you for your very fine translation.    The hearing is adjourned.
