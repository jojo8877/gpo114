    Mr. Engel. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for calling this markup. Let me say that I agree with every word you said. I want to put my thoughts with yours. I know we are short on time, so I will enter my full statement into the record and issue it to the press.    But I fully support these measures, and am particularly happy that our committee once again is advancing good bipartisan legislation, as we have done so often. So I ask unanimous consent that my statement be part of the record. I wish everyone a happy holiday weekend, and I yield back.
