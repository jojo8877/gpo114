    Mr. Salmon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Last time you were here, Mr. Lewis, you testified that Americans have been killed and I am going to piggyback on Mr. Issa and Mr. Duncan's questions.    You subsequently notified the committee that those deaths occurred in Afghanistan by as many as 14 former detainees all who were released by the Bush administration and I'd just like to ask a few questions about that.    How many Americans were killed? Were they U.S. servicemen and -women, civilians or both? What are their names and where are they from?    Mr. Salmon. Okay. And just to recap the specifics, I'd like to know whether they were servicemen or servicewomen or civilians or both and I'd like to know what their names are and where they are from. Those are the things I'd like and you can provide or get me all of that?    Mr. Salmon. That'll be very, very helpful. And then just to piggyback on some of the other questions, knowing that there were casualties associated with those detainees to Afghanistan, you then as an administration decided then it was okay to still release detainees to Afghanistan? Is that correct?    Mr. Salmon. Well, prior to releasing detainees to Afghanistan, did the intelligence community assess that the Government of Afghanistan was incapable of maintaining custody and control of these individuals?    Mr. Salmon. But you did state for the record that one of your criteria for releasing them to Afghanistan was not monitoring. That's not a concern. You didn't care whether they were able to monitor or not?    Mr. Salmon. Well, Afghanistan is an active war zone and it is also one of the most corrupt countries in the world, and so I guess what a lot of us would like to better understand is if monitoring isn't part of the decision and making sure that their whereabouts are readily ascertained, I guess a lot of us wonder why that isn't one of the criteria.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yield back.
