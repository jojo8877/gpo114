    Ms. Bland, you are recognized for 5 minutes.    Ms. BLAND. Thank you, Chairman Chabot, Ranking Member Ms. Velazquez, and members of this Committee for the opportunity to testify. Thanks also to our local representatives for your tireless commitment to retaining equitable opportunities for working and middle class New Yorkers and their families.    My name is Bob Bland, and I'm the CEO and founder of MANUFACTURE New York. I created MANUFACTURE New York in 2012 to rethink the fashion ecosystem and create a new vertically integrated 21st century business model that serves the industry's domestic urban manufacturing needs of today and the future. Our mission is to reawaken and rebuild America's fashion industry, foster the next wave of businesses, and create a transparent, sustainable global supply chain.    In the past 3 and a half years, we have grown our community to over 10,000 American designers, manufacturers, technologists, and proponents of domestic production, helped 150 small businesses here in New York City to successfully launch or reshore their apparel lines, and piloted incubator programs for startups in fashion and contracting manufacturing, and accelerated programs for wearable tech startups, thanks in part to the generous support of the SBA Growth Accelerator Fund, which is a great example of a program to help not just small business, but incubator and accelerator programs themselves because they're usually small businesses, and they need help starting up, too.    Since the recession, virtually all small creative and manufacturing businesses in New York City have had the exact same challenges. It was stunning for me at the beginning as a designer finding out that my contract manufacturers had the exact same problems that I did, access to affordable industrial space. Long-term leases, major problem. Relocation grants and construction loans are very hard to come by when you are displaced.    Access to affordable housing is increasingly becoming impossible here in New York City, especially within a reasonable commutable distance. For instance, we have 40 percent of our apparel manufacturing workforce here in New York City in the Flushing area of Queens, and getting them down to South Brooklyn, how in the world do you do that? We have major transportation problems.    There's very low access to working capital that's affordable, and also lines of credit to grow our small businesses, and that's still a huge, major problem. Access to competitive equipment procurement and training programs that are sector specific so that we can adapt to our rapidly-changing industry, are very necessary. They need to also be nationalized in a way that can result in certifications so that people can understand across States and across cities.    Fashion design and manufacturing jobs are more than just jobs. They're inclusive pathways to careers and potential business ownership themselves regardless of educational background or socioeconomic statutes. Typically they pay on average apparel manufacturing $59,750 a year, which is a good job, and they're likely to include benefits and a clear path for growth. Also, skills training is typically included, and opportunities to advance in management positions and beyond.    The New York City fashion ecosystem is unique in that historically New York's iconic garment district in 1931 was the largest garment district in the world. I'd like to say it's the original fashion incubator, and the original incubator program. It was because of the co-location and the proximity of all of the different parts of the supply chain together. It employed 1 million people at its height here in New York City. While it is contracted now to 15,000 apparel manufacturers total for the entire city as of this year, that still accounts for 30 percent of manufacturers in New York City. It's still a very huge sector when it comes to manufacturing. Every single one of those jobs are important.    We have several opportunities coming up at the intersection of fashion sustainability and technology if we seize the moment for urban manufacturing here in New York. There's already 900 fashion companies headquartered here in New York City that employ 180,000 people and generate over $11 billion in wages and $2 billion taxes per year, so it's a big business. The industry at large is a $4 trillion global business, but we're also the number two polluter in the world right behind oil, which is shocking to most people.    From the smallest emerging design startups that are MANUFACTURE New York to the largest department stores and conglomerates, everyone is looking for a solution that includes conceptualization, research and development, commercialization, and a shared set of resources and best practices to capture value and provide accountability at all stages of the supply chain. That's an area that New York City could really take hold, and then connect with other urban manufacturing centers all throughout the United States.    I'd like to say that the best example I've seen of that so far, Representative Ms. Velazquez, you were saying, is that we're now part of one of the Manufacturing Innovation Institutes. That is an Obama Administration initiative to create these advanced manufacturing institutes. The one that we're in is the Revolutionary Textile and Fibers Manufacturing Institute.    And I would like to say that that program--I'd love to give you more information about it--really needs to be expanded to other urban centers because it's a way for us to bring all the stakeholders to the table, all the national educational institutions, all of the state organizations, workforce training, and then to create this network nationally for a specific sector, in this case, the next generation of textiles and fibers.    So thank you very much.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.    Mr. DiMarino, you are recognized for 5 minutes.                 STATEMENT OF MICHAEL DiMARINO    Mr. DiMARINO. Good morning, and thank you all for inviting me to testify before this Committee. I'm Mike DiMarino, president of Linda Tool. We're a second-generation family-owned manufacturer of precision machine components and assemblies located in Brooklyn, New York. Linda Tool has been located in Brooklyn since its inception in 1952.    Manufacturing in New York has always been so much of a challenge as it has been a blessing. New York has always enjoyed a rich history of manufacturing and cutting-edge technology. I'll give you a few examples.    Most people don't realize that New York is the proud home of the Coleman gas lamp mantle which was invented on Canal Street in New York City. The company today, Navis Global, is still a major customer of Linda Tool and has been since 1964.    It now produces high-tech cloth processing equipment, and Linda Tool makes components that no other company has ever made    New York is also home to the largest manufacturer of window envelope machinery in the world, F.L. Smithe, located on West 44th through West 48th Street and West Street in Manhattan. This was a cutting technology in its day. The Bahama Hinge Company, which probably most of the doors in this room have on them, was also located in Brooklyn, and AMF, the maker of bowling alley equipment, was located in Brooklyn, and now houses Lutheran Medical Center. Mergenthaler Linotype, Correcto-Type, even Ex-Lax belongs in New York City. These are all companies with cutting-edge technology in their heyday.    As it was in 1950, 2016 New York City is still a great place to manufacturer and has so much to offer. New York now boasts a robust 3D printer industry, a rapidly-growing drone manufacturing sector, and cutting-edge technology in recycling and biofuel. Honeybee Robotics of Manhattan was instrumental in development of the Mars Land Rover. This is all made possible by the opportunities that New York has to offer.    Most recently, New York City Schools have placed an emphasis on the development of manufacturing skills. Linda Tool recently hired two graduates from City Tech who went through their manufacturing engineering curriculum. These two new employees have the skills necessary to help Linda Tool move forward in the next phase of manufacturing. Their skills acquired in school, coupled with Linda Tool's old world training, is already paying off with some great advanced technology capabilities.    The schools are on the right track, but need more hands-on training in this curriculum as this would make graduates much more job ready. I personally would love to see an apprenticeship program for the manufacturing sector in place in the future.    The challenges are many. They are difficult, but you can understand some of it. Trying to marry urban life with industrial production is a challenge for anybody or any city that tries to do it. The New York City industrial business zones are one aspect that helps those of us trying to maintain a viable manufacturing business in New York.    One of the main challenges going forward is the loss of commercial industrial property. Gentrification is probably the biggest obstacle. As commercial and industrial areas are rezoned, it drives the price of real estate to such levels that economics just fail in trying to maintain a business. The preservation of the IBZs will greatly help with this, but they must be maintained.    The ability to move in this sector of technology can only have good benefits for all. Linda Tool itself was once an old world smoky, poorly lit, hazardous place to be employed. Today it is a modern, air-conditioned, well-lit, well-equipped manufacturing facility that boasts an employment stay of 15 years. We're also one of the few, if not the only, manufacturer in New York City that boasts a green roof on the entire roof of its facility.    We also have a wage scale that meets or exceeds our industry, and personally it is very satisfying to see employees of the company thrive. The higher wage scale is because of our ability to introduce more advanced technology into our business. This may not result in the head counts of yesteryear, but it most certainly lends itself to a higher-paying job for those that acquire the skills to do so.    Looking back, New York has always been a technology leader in many aspects. Obviously the technology has changed drastically, and many today have no idea of some of the things that were previously mentioned in this testimony. Regardless, New York was always a leader in advanced technology whatever the era. Looking to the future, I believe there is a bright spot for us in the manufacturing sector as long as preserve our industrial zones and concentrate on educating and training our youth, providing them with hands-on learning and what to expect in the working world. A good part of that is the work that our local development organizations are doing, coupled with the work that the Federal and local government is contributing.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much.    Ms. Davis, you are recognized for 5 minutes.    Ms. DAVIS. Good morning, Chairman Chabot, Ranking Member Velazquez, and also Congressman Meeks. I am honored to be here today to testify.    My name is Nekisia Davis. I'm the owner of Early Bird Foods in Red Hook, Brooklyn. We're a very small manufacturer of granola and granola bars. As Ranking Member Velazquez says, I started the company when I was managing a restaurant in Brooklyn called Franny's. I brought granola in to co-workers, and there was kind of like a small cult that was formed, and it was within a year that I was a full-time granola maker.    To say that I had no idea what I was doing is a giant understatement. I had been fumbling into being a small business owner every step of the way. I feel like I'm at a table of people who are so articulate and know exactly what they're doing, and I am learning every day. Every single day I learn how to be a better businessperson, and I think I'm definitely not one of few. There are a lot of people that are in the same industry as me that are kind of doing the same thing.    We now have six full-time employees, two part-time employees. We have many selling channels. We distribute our goods throughout the United States, very soon to China, Japan, the United Kingdom. I sell direct to a lot of stores in the U.S., and then also we have pretty good Web site sales.    I think we tapped into something that was very familiar that we approached in a unique way. I developed a palate through working at some of the best restaurants in New York that allowed me to kind of approach in a new way in how to make it. It's been very successful. Within the first 3 months of my business, I was on the Martha Stewart Show making granola with Martha. I had a write-up in the New York Times, New York Magazine. I was on the shelf at Whole Foods--that was my second account--all because of the community that I've created through working in restaurants and food with chefs and wonderful people here in this city.    At that time, it felt like small food manufacturing in this city was in its infancy. It was difficult to find a place to legally produce food, and no one really knew what to do or how to do it. You certainly couldn't make it in your kitchen, and you didn't really know what the other option was. I kind of fumbled around to a couple of different office cooperatives. I landed in an incubator kitchen in Coney Island where I would have to lug 50-pound bags of oats and sunflower seeds into my car, load them into the kitchen, and, 1, 2, 3, go, bake as hard and fast as I could, package, label, clean, load back into my car, bring it back home, and come back and do the same thing the next day. It was a very, very challenging time.    I took out a very small loan from a friend, built out a space in 2001. It was 900 square feet. I quickly realized within a week it had improper electric to run all the equipment I needed, and I was there for 4 years doing kind of a gamble, a jump around and forth.    Two years ago, I was able to take out a business loan. I had been in business for 5 years, and I had a bank that believed in me, which I was very proud of. We built a warehouse and commercial kitchen in Red Hook, and I fear that we'll outgrow it probably in another 2 years, although I have a lease secured for another 8.    We have had very, very good luck in business. We've always been a business people love. I was raised in the way of the Danny Meyer hospitality. You have to run your business with compassion and empathy, and take care of your people first, take care of your customers second. It's worked very well, and I think that it resonates well with people. We have very, very loyal customers because of it.    Now, in all this sweet hippy granola fest, we have a lot of challenges. The number one challenge for me is workers' comp insurance. We are in a classification of manufacturing, and I don't know if I share the same issue with people at the table here, but we pay 3 times the rate of a cook in a restaurant kitchen, and that is a very high-risk job. The highest risk that I have in my kitchen is someone getting a burn on their arm. It's just very, very low risk. We're baking oats in an oven, and letting them cool, and putting them into a bag. The numbers I pay for workers' comp are astronomical. There's no one that I can talk to or convince that these rates are not appropriate to the amount of risk that we have.    Another issue has been with landlord-tenant relations. I feel like a landlord to provide a safe place for us to do business, to help facilitate business is just a given. I've had a lot of problems with landlords not having equipment that's working properly, and it really, really hinders our business. I had a freight elevator in my last kitchen go down for 3 weeks with no attempt to get it fixed. I had a P.O. that was supposed to go out to Whole Foods. I mean, my business was pretty paralyzed for 3 weeks. Thousands and thousands of dollars of business was lost.    When I attempted to negotiate a rent break from the landlord because of the loss in business, not only were we not helped out, but we were turned against. We were discriminated against as women, being told that we didn't know what we were doing because we're women in business. He turned against us, he sued us, doubled our rent, and evicted us, and we had no power at all.    I think the final thing beyond those struggles, obviously getting capital to buy bigger, save money, it's very, very difficult. I acquired capital to build out the kitchen where I am now, and I just can't have access to anymore because I have such a large amount that's borrowed. We have excellent credit. We have excellent annual revenue. We just don't have access to anything. We are trying to keep up and grow at the same time. It's very a paralyzing feeling. Cash flow is growing smaller by the day.    I want to thank you again, and say in these moments we have to zoom out and remember this is one moment in a long journey. To have the collaboration and the care from the three of you is very comforting. Again, I'm honored to be here today.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much.    Mr. Jacobs, you are recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. JACOBS. Good morning, Ranking Member Ms. Velazquez, Chairman Chabot, and other members of this Committee.    My name is Edward Jacobs, a Pratt graduate with a focus on industrial design, architecture, and engineering. Most of my adult life has been spent living and working within New York City being a designer and working initially with smaller-scale products. One quickly recognizes the challenges of sourcing manufacturers locally while attempting to secure reasonable pricing affordability and access to product.    I'm honored to be here with you today to talk about attempting to navigate the manufacturing community locally in New York City, nationally living in other States, and internationally sourcing to eventually manufacturers ourselves with FXE Industries.    FXE is a startup focusing on transportation and, more specifically, advanced motorcycle design and engineering. Our approach is a holistic one that bridges the gap typically found between fields within the realm of manufacturing. This is a modular approach to large-scale manufacturing that allows us to circumvent some of the pitfalls of highly-specialized niche employment, and, in turn, allows us to train and foster greater technical manufacturing abilities in house. This approach will allow us to offer accessibility of product so we may open up the market to a significantly greater number of customers.    We're in the process of securing 50,000 square feet of design, engineering, and manufacturing space. This opportunity to grow to a 100-plus team has ultimately been afforded to by the Brooklyn Navy Yard. I initially became a tenant of Brooklyn Navy Yard through New Lab. It's where I grew my first design and engineering company, DNI. New Lab is a great example of an entity that is helping enable a very substantial evolution in specialized manufacturing.    A good example of this is DNI's design, engineering, and sourcing for the Lowline underground park to be located at the base of the Williamsburg Bridge that has many challenges in its initial stages to be completed. This is an example of a potential large-scale architectural project with global implications. The entire project has been designed, engineered, sourced, and manufactured all in New York City.    The basis of this project being support of plant life and public space below the surface of the earth is a great example of the full spectrum of manufacturing and tremendous social impact New York can foster. This correlates directly with what FXE is attempting. Choosing to operate here in NYC with the sheer density and diversity will allow us a fantastic base of talent, younger, older, from all fields and walks of life to pull from. Being a new manufacturer and being supported and supporting establishments like the Brooklyn Navy Yard makes us very hopeful for the new positive city building manufacturing efforts growing within the 21st century in NYC.    I think a lot of the challenges that we've had have been finding funding outside of private funding. It seems as though a lot of the funding or the establishments are treated more the same kind of treatment we get from a bank. I think there needs to be development of a different spirit in lending where maybe people can actually view a business plan, make competent decisions so that startups, smaller entities can actually get capital to grow. And there's one other educational kind of gap that I see personally because of my background in industrial design and engineering. There isn't an educational element that bridges this foundation gap that you've seen throughout the years. There's definitely a rift.    And so, I think there's an opportunity there in New York to bridge this gap. I think what we have educational kind of institutional wise, bridging the gap between a few of them can really open up a whole new industry.    Thank you very much. I'm totally honored to be here. I really appreciate the time.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much. I want to thank all the members of the panel for their testimony, really excellent testimony from each one. I would now like to turn to the ranking member. I am going to allow her to ask her questions first.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Bland, why did you choose to locate your facility here in New York City? What advantage does your business have over others because of its location?    Ms. BLAND. Well, we are located in Sunset Park at Liberty View Industrial Plaza, which is a development by Sumar Properties. The reason we are located there is because Sunset Park is a walk to work neighborhood that has many, many people who are already familiar with manufacturing. It is primarily a Latino and East Asian base, so a lot of these folks already have apparel manufacturing skills. It makes it much easier for us to hire people.    The reason for New York is because the fashion industry is iconic to New York City, and there are already so many skilled people also closing the loop in having all the designers, all of the development, and then also the sampling, how they are making all of it right in New York makes so much sense for these brands. It is starting to make more and sense. For instance, we just picked up Calvin Klein as a client. That was not something that we were expecting to happen this soon, because they are starting to pay attention to, oh, we need to do our development closer to home. New York City has a really incredible opportunity there.    For all of our startups, having the access to the major media outlets and having all of the really good press, it very much helps startups to get the word out about their new products and their new businesses, as well as Silicon Alley, the new fashion tech scene, the wearable tech scene. We are not seeing a lot of venture capital go into anything besides tech anymore. We have to take advantage of the fact that we are a fashion capital, and make sure that there is not a bunch of money being sunk into ugly products that do not make sense and do not work for the customer, and that no one in fashion has been consulted on them.    Instead we work with companies and work with VCs to ensure that they are employing the local workforce, and that everyone can take advantage of this opportunity, and that is going to require a lot of STEM training. That is going to require a lot of engineering, science, and other training to be combined with commercial manufacturing. We see a next generation of jobs there.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you. Thank you. I am so proud that we worked to prevent that building from being sold----    Ms. BLAND. We are so grateful----    Ms. VELAZQUEZ.--and putting it up for auction.    Ms. BLAND. Thank you for your support.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Sure. Mr. Jacobs.    Mr. JACOBS. Yes?    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. There is a large and growing gap between idea conception and sustainable sales that every manufacturer must go through, the valley of death. Bridging that financial gap is critical for success, but often funding for companies at this stage is difficult to secure because of the inherent risk. Can you describe your difficulties in obtaining financing at this stage?    Mr. JACOBS. Yeah, absolutely. A lot of the challenges have been since we do not have a lot of assets to leverage, that, you know, borrowing can be very difficult. We have actually tried multiple ways to secure financing. Most of it has been from independent private financing, but we also have gone the EB-5 route. But there seems to be a large challenge because EB-5 funding seems to focus more so on real estate endeavors because of their inherent lower risk. And also one of the other panel members mentioned tech investment. It seems that everyone through all of our meetings is always looking for a strictly tech angle, almost looking for a very quick return, like a Google or, you know, some type of explosion because of some tech industry thing.    I do not know if it is because of a lack of understanding about some of the basic things in hard product design and manufacturing, but there seems to be, I guess, kind of just a rose-colored glasses effect on the tech industry that people are very much looking for a quick return.    What we are doing is something that we believe, it is more of a long-term thing. Any large-scale manufacturing endeavor is not a 1- or 2-year, you know, quick return things. It is a 10-, 15-year thing endeavor. I think sustained growth absolutely, but to find the people that are doing it, very difficult.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you. Ms. Davis, pretty soon we are going to be voting on a trade agreement, and we know that small exporters, small businesses are the majority of exporters. Yet if they do business with just one country, they will have only one customer in that country. I would like to hear from you, can you discuss your efforts to export your goods, and what challenges you have faced in doing business internationally?    Ms. DAVIS. Well, I think the biggest challenge is to try to get it to a place where they can sell it. There are so many costs that are involved in shipping. Me saying that we distribute to China, this is the first round of going to China. The taxes on goods that come in I think is something like 30 percent, and I don't know where that can be minimized, but that is a huge, huge challenge is to get the goods, which are already very expensive. My profit margins are right where they need to be in order to keep going just to try to get pricing.    When we do work with a distributor, it is really for kind of one place, and there does not seem to be a whole lot of expansion possible. I work with one distributor that sells to markets and dispensers in London, but that is the only person they sell to.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. And just tell me with a yes or no answer, have you contacted or used any of the programs through the federal Department of Commerce or the Small Business Administration----    Ms. DAVIS. No.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ.--to help you in that regard?    Ms. DAVIS. No.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.    Chairman CHABOT. Okay. The gentlelady's time has expired. I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes.    With the four of you from here to here, let me ask you, when you started out your business, was it just yourself? Did you have anybody else? How many employees do you have now? We will just go down the line so we can get a good idea of what size businesses we are talking. Mr. Jacobs?    Mr. JACOBS. Yes, thank you. We started with two employees, myself and a co-founder, Francois Terney, and we have expanded now a very small amount. We only have four employees. We are looking to expand within 2017 up to 50,000 square feet, and probably----    Chairman CHABOT. So you have doubled two to four and maybe even further.    Mr. JACOBS. Yeah.    Chairman CHABOT. Over what period of time is that?    Mr. JACOBS. Probably about a year and a half.    Chairman CHABOT. Okay, thank you.    Mr. JACOBS. Yeah.    Chairman CHABOT. Okay. Ms. Davis?    Ms. DAVIS. I started alone and was alone for several years. I now have a team of eight including me, and we have been in business for 7 years.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much. Mr. DiMarino?    Mr. DiMARINO. Now we have 28. When I started working in the company in 1975 we were three.    Chairman CHABOT. 1975 did you say?    Mr. DiMARINO. That is when I started working there, we were three.    Chairman CHABOT. Yeah.    Mr. DiMARINO. Now we are 28, but we also survived the recession and did not lay anybody off through all that, which was pretty difficult. But we are able to maintain our force and expand it a little bit.    Chairman CHABOT. Absolutely, thank you. Ms. Bland?    Ms. BLAND. We started with just me, and 3 and a half years we now have nine full-time W-2 employees, and then two part-time W-2 employees. We have 20 businesses on site, and they all have one or more employees.    Chairman CHABOT. Excellent. You literally are the backbone of this economy, small businesses. Congratulations to each of you for what you have accomplished. It is very impressive, it really is.    Mr. Friedman, let me ask you, you had mentioned the New Market Tax Credit Program. We use that pretty extensively in Cincinnati, especially in revitalizing the downtown area, and we have been pretty successful. In fact, the chairwoman at the time came there and saw a few years back what they are doing down there.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Our committee, Small Business, while I was the chair was one that worked on the legislation.    Chairman CHABOT. Yeah. We had a bunch of our colleagues came from other communities around the country to kind of learn about the New Market Tax Credit Program. Now, you mentioned there are some things that could be better. Could you tell the folks how that works in about a minute's time, and what improvements you might make?    Mr. FRIEDMAN. In determining whether or not a project is eligible for new market tax credits, they look at the Census tracts and the income population in the Census tracts, and I think it is increasingly targeted to highly distressed communities.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Yes.    Mr. FRIEDMAN. What has happened, in part because it is a reflection of the density in cities, if you have a small housing development that is market rate, it will skew the income for that neighborhood so that it knocks out the entire Census tract and everything sort of in proximity to it because there is a boundary. It is not only your Census tract. It is the adjacent tract.    Chairman CHABOT. So would it be your recommendation that that is something that Congress ought to look at and maybe adjust accordingly?    Mr. FRIEDMAN. Yes, for industrial projects. Our resources are scarce, and we recognize that, and we have to figure out how to use it more effectively. Certainly beyond the industrial development side, yes.    Chairman CHABOT. I would yield.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you for yielding. The main mission of the market is to create jobs that will benefit low-income communities. Because of gentrification and displacement, we have an issue, but it is worth revisiting when we have to reauthorize.    Chairman CHABOT. That is the kind of stuff that we have worked on in a bipartisan manner over the years. We will look at that as a result of this hearing.    Let me ask the four of you again. I think you said no, but has anybody had occasion to use the services of the SBA in the past, the Small Business Administration, either alone or anything? Mr. Jacobs, what was your experience or what did you use them for?    Mr. JACOBS. My experience was when the storm hit, initially before we started or before I started FXE, my business partner had another company, DNI. It was out on a pier in Red Hook, and the whole place got flooded, 65 inches. Everything was literally destroyed. I was able to get an SBA disaster loan to continue----    Chairman CHABOT. Speaking of that storm, by the way, Ms. Velazquez was able to get some legislation passed through Congress that had a dramatic impact on that, you know. Did you want to talk about, Nydia?    Mr. JACOBS. Thank you for that.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. What we found was the fact that the decline rate of disaster loans was extremely high, and I asked for the GAO to conduct an investigation that basically validated my worst fears, that too many loans were declined. Many small businesses on the Lower East Side, and in Red Hook were impacted, and did not have an opportunity to get the assistance that they needed.    For the first time in the history of the program through my legislation, it was reopened. Any business that did not get a loan could reapply, and anyone who lost their business could also reapply.    Mr. JACOBS. One thing. Thank you very much for the efforts you put forward in that. One thing I would just like to say maybe so you would know, they actually made me leverage my actual home, though, which if I did not own a property I would not have been able to get that loan.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Well, now we changed it.    Mr. JACOBS. Okay, fantastic. Thank you.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Okay.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much. My time has expired. The gentleman, Mr. Meeks, is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. MEEKS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning. I just want to thank each and every one of these panelists. Extraordinary is what makes America America. You are stick-to-it, and I know it is difficult. Let me ask, I know Ms. Davis was asked, but let me ask Mr. Jacobs first. Have you utilized any, whether it is SBA, whether it is the U.S. Department of Commerce? You indicated that you were looking to do things internationally also. Is that correct?    Mr. JACOBS. Yes.    Mr. MEEKS. Whether it is the Ex-Im Bank or OPIC, have you utilized any of the government programs to try to help enhance your business?    Mr. JACOBS. In FXE, there are a few things that have been done. I am basically behind the computer doing all the engineering and the components and everything. We have a different entity in our company that could probably speak a little bit more.    I mainly do all the engineering and all the design work actually, so I am not the one to focus on the international kind of financing. The only internationally that we have attempted to do is the EB-5 Program, which it does not seem to be a program that is very stable, and there seems to be like a loopholes and a lot of strangeness to it. Again, it focuses more so on real estate and very low-risk investment where we need that to be kind of be able to take a higher risk, you know, and invest in companies like ours.    Mr. MEEKS. Ms. Davis, you indicated you are starting to go into China, et cetera. Have you looked toward, and I listened to your three problems. One, workers' compensation insurance, two, landlord relations, three, access to capital, and breaking down barriers internationally. I think that is indicated by Ranking Member Velazquez, trade agreements that we are looking at, whether or not they break down some of those barriers.    My question, have you looked at Ex-Im Bank, for example, or OPIC, or any other government, you know, using the U.S. Commerce. They have a program or the Chamber of Commerce. I do not know if any of you are involved in the Chamber of Commerce, whether it is the Brooklyn Chamber or the U.S. Chamber. Have you utilized any of those entities to help you to grow and to move forward with reference to the company?    Ms. DAVIS. I have not really, and honestly I am not too aware of what is available to me. I think that is simply because I spend most of my time chasing people for money to pay my Amex bill. To be completely honest, to even imagine spending enough time to devote to get into one of those systems or in one of the programs, it is seems overwhelming, and maybe it is not. But I have not ever because of that.    Mr. MEEKS. I am sure it is overwhelming. You are trying to run a business, and you are trying to do a number of things.    Ms. DAVIS. Yeah.    Mr. MEEKS. Chasing and finding out what program is there or not there is not something that is your focus.    Ms. DAVIS. No.    Mr. MEEKS. Your focus is move your product on a day-to-day basis. But I do want to let you know that there are, especially internationally, some opportunities for financing and access to capital. We have been putting a very tough fight as far as the reauthorization of Ex-Im Bank to make sure that they are catering to small businesses to help them do exports. I wanted to bring that to your attention.    Mr. DiMarino, let me ask you. You have been in business a long time. Have you utilized any of the government services or government programs that may be available to help you enhance and grow your business?    Mr. DiMARINO. No loans through the SBA, but we were able to put our green roof through the good graces of Congressman Velazquez on our facility with a Federal grant, which was quite a project.    Mr. MEEKS. Ms. Bland, same question.    Ms. BLAND. Yeah. We have won a couple of grants from the SBA to run our incubator program, and then to expand our incubator program to include contract manufacturers, so we are very grateful for that. Also we were asked to come down and talk with SBA about the importance of having a classification for microbusinesses. I was astonished when I found out originally what the definition of a ``small business'' was for the United States, and that is still something that completely vexes me. I consider 500 employees to be a huge business, you know. There are a lot of smaller businesses that are 25 people and under, and they deserve a specific type of support. I appreciate them having us talk about that.    Mr. MEEKS. I think that we need to make sure that those agencies are getting back out to small business so that they know what is going on more.    Ms. BLAND. Well, I think they need sector specific Web sites, that it is just like, hey, food businesses, here is what you can do. Hey, fashion, here is what you can do. And have it be completely separate and regimented and clear.    Mr. MEEKS. Let me ask. I know I am out of time, but, Ms. Bland, you shook your head that you had worked with Chambers of Commerce, whether it was the Brooklyn Chamber.    Ms. BLAND. Oh, yeah, I love the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. I cannot believe how well they have outreached to small business to hiring. Like I started, and it literally was like me and two other people, and already they were reaching out to us and seeing what they could do to help. I do not think we would be where we are at without the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce.    Mr. MEEKS. Thank you. I am out of time.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired. Before recognizing the gentlelady for her questions, I would like to recognize one of your members of Council here. Councilman Robert Cornegy is here, and he is the chairman of City Council's Small Business Committee.    You all here also in City Council have a small business committee as well, and Councilman Cornegy is the chairman of that committee. We appreciate him being here and showing his interest. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.    Mr. MEEKS. He is short, though.    Chairman CHABOT. I would now like to recognize the gentlelady from New York, although all my colleagues are gentlefolks from New York, Ms. Clarke, for 5 minutes.    Ms. CLARKE. Thank you very much, Chairman Chabot, and to Ranking Member Velazquez. To our witnesses, thank you for coming today to share your and lend your expertise to the subject matter. I, first of all, want to express my regret in being delayed this morning. I had a small business event in my district just prior to getting here, and so please excuse me.    I wanted to ask a couple of questions of you, Ms. Davis in particular. We are intrigued, of course, by small businesses that take on sort of the entrepreneurial spirit that leads them to marketing overseas and to capturing those markets. As we know, more than 95 percent of the world's consumers live abroad, but more than half of small exporters post sales to only one foreign market. It is our goal to make exporting more attainable for small businesses, and your business is available throughout Europe and Japan.    In your experience, which countries are generally easiest to export to, and what makes breaking into more than one foreign market so challenging?    Ms. DAVIS. I think it is difficult to answer that question because I work with distributors that handle a lot of the exportation, and the people that I export to have come to me as most of our accounts have. I am like a business unicorn in that way. We are really, really lucky. I do not have a good answer for you.    Ms. CLARKE. So we would probably have to take a look at the whole distribution network and the relationships.    Ms. DAVIS. I would hit up the international distributors for that information because they are really the ones that are going back and forth and dealing with taxes, and laws, and tariffs, and transportation. I just have to get my pallets down to them in a container, and then they take it from there.    Ms. CLARKE. Very well. Ms. Bland, MANUFACTURE New York facilitates relationships between designers and a production team, and you act as a type of mentor to budding fashion designers, and encourage them to not only produce their brand, but grow their business. Can you discuss some of the challenges that you face in making these connections between production teams and the designers?    Ms. BLAND. That is actually one of our strengths because everyone on my team comes from the fashion industry, and we have all been marketing locally for decades. So I would say that it is a more general challenge for designers in New York City before they find MANUFACTURE New York because most manufacturers do not want to be contacted by unvetted designers or new businesses that do not understand how to manufacture and how to speak with manufacturers.    One thing that we have worked very hard on is to create fashion design boot camps where designers get to learn the entire manufacturing process in a weekend. At that point they are not coming to all of these contract manufacturers who are all individually all over the city and all five boroughs, and asking for things that are impossible, things that cannot be done in timelines that are not feasible at prices that sound ridiculous because they are thinking that they are going to get the same price as China.    We try to provide some background around that, and I would say that those sort of programs, we want to work with local schools, including high schools, to help get people more educated earlier in the process because nationally fashion designers as a career has doubled in terms of the Census over the last decade. It is astonishing how many people want to be fashion entrepreneurs, and we want to help them to have access to it, but in a way that makes sense for manufacturers.    I would add that the garment district is a place where everyone was co-located together in a very high concentration, that idea still needs to remain. Having contract manufacturers spread out throughout the city in a way that they are not able to access the same support structures and the same infrastructure as each other and networks is unfortunate. That goes for everything from hiring, to equipment, to systems, to grants, to you name it.    The idea of co-locating them all on site in one place, which is what we are working towards at Liberty View Industrial Plaza, that is a 21st century model for garment manufacturing.    Ms. CLARKE. And, Mr. Friedman, many small manufacturers with growth potential may not seek assistance with operations, marketing, and finance because they are simply unware that resources are available. However, the SBA has many entrepreneurial development programs, including SBDCs and women's business center. What can we do to increase the awareness among small manufacturers of the SBA's business counseling services?    Mr. FRIEDMAN. I think there is a tremendous network of economic development organizations and professionals out there. I think Mike is on the board of----    Mr. DiMARINO. Yes.    Mr. FRIEDMAN.--of South Brooklyn Development Corporation, so that is one example of an intermediary that generally does not get Federal funding, but their job is to make those connections. So Bob may be doing it in one particular sector, but just building the basic economic development infrastructure so that those connections can be made. Maybe there is a Federal funding opportunity or just some acknowledgement about the need for that strata of intermediary.    Ms. CLARKE. Very well. Thank you, Mr. Friedman. I wanted to acknowledge very quickly Mr. Meeks and, of course, our councilman, Robert Cornegy and thank them for being a part of today's proceedings. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.    Chairman CHABOT. Thank you very much. The gentlelady yields back. We are going to into one more round of questions here, and I would like to recognize Ranking Member, Ms. Velazquez, for 5 minutes first.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. DiMarino, as more manufacturing work moves toward automation, workers need advance education to operate the machinery that produces highly technical goods, like computers and aerospace parts. And these jobs also command higher pay. What are the challenges you are facing today in that regard?    Mr. DiMARINO. The challenges are really the training. I do not think it is so much of a higher education. It is one's ambition or willingness to learn and apply themselves to it. Like I said in my testimony, we hired two young people from City Tech, and the first young lady came in and she wanted to program my CNC machines. She never did it in her life. I interviewed her, and I could just see the fire burning in her belly. It was staring at me right in my face.    So I called my foreman. I said, Dave, you know, take Anna around and show her. He said, what do you want to hire somebody else in the office for? It is too much overhead. Just take her around and talk to her. He came back in a half an hour, he says, hire her. You could see she had a hunger for it, and we sent her for training, and now she is programming five-axis machines. It is unbelievable. It was tremendous.    Someone does not need years of education. I mean, we put her in education, but not advanced education. But it is the willingness to learn, and you have to have an interest in it.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Friedman, so many times we meet with businesses, and when we ask them the biggest challenge they are facing, it is the lack of trained workers. What kind of role do you see for the federal government and at the state level that we could be doing more in terms of learning opportunities for our workforce?    Mr. FRIEDMAN. One is an expansion of something you are already doing now having to do with support community colleges.    Mr. FRIEDMAN. Not just growing support for community colleges, but also shifting to an apprenticeship model or providing additional funding for apprenticeships. One of the things that companies often say to me is that they would prefer to do the training themselves. Because manufacturing is essentially small business, the diversity of skills is tremendous. If we move towards kind of a lifelong learning model using apprenticeships, I think that would, you know, allow for the diversity in the sector, and yet create, you know, a stream of skilled workers.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Let us talk for a second about how our country needs to encourage more students to pursue degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math, you know, the STEM subjects. What do you think? In terms of your organization and your relationship with the public school system in New York City, do you have any type of interaction? Do you have any type of conversation? Are there any type of meetings that take place to assess how can we encourage more, especially in places like New York City where the face is changing? You have more Latinos, more women, more African-Americans, more Asians.    What can we do to narrow the gap that exists between what is going on in terms of the marketplace and the curriculum that we have in place these days?    Mr. FRIEDMAN. Sure. I am not sure I can offer the big answer there.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Sure.    Mr. FRIEDMAN. But to bring something together that I think a bunch of us have talked about is how to co-locate different types of services. Workforce development and education is always the odd man out, and maybe that is a function of funding streams that is distinct from economic development. There is a tremendous silo between our economic development organizations and our workforce and labor organizations.    One of the things that Pratt is working on with the Brooklyn Navy Yard, with City Tech, with the Board of Ed, Department of Education, is to co-locate a whole bunch of those facilities in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. We are in proximity to a number of NYCHA developments. So the idea is to make it as absolutely seamless as possible.    Businesses, residents, they do not know who they are getting services from half the time, nor should they, you know. They should not have to have that skill. We want them to be good at their business. We want them to be good in high school. Pratt Institute already brings about 200 students to campus every Saturday to do STEAM education, and we are trying to link that moving forward with a CTE school that would be located at the Brooklyn Navy Yard so that you can get a real seamless integration of training, and resident employment, and business development.    Chairman CHABOT. Okay. Thank you very much. The gentlelady's time has expired. I recognize myself for 5 minutes.    One of the things, and I think, Mr. Friedman, you had mentioned that tax policy is not the primary concern that business folks have, you know, but it certainly is one of the things that they have to consider. I was wondering if any of the members on the panel were aware that towards the end of last year, Congress passed some legislation relative to the Tax Code that was supposed to help especially small businesses that did a couple of things.    One thing, there is Section 179 expensing that you could buy a piece of equipment and take it off all in that year. There are limitations to it, but overall rather than depreciating this over 15 years or a long time, you could take it all off that year right off your taxes. So the incentives, the argument was people would buy that piece of equipment, and put it into service, and become more productive, and be able to take it right off their taxes that year. That would help both that company that bought it, plus the company that made that thing, hopefully made here in the United States. We cannot control that, but hopefully made here, and the people that worked in that factory. That would help the economy. That was the idea.    Also the research and development tax credit, and we made these things, we made them permanent. Let us see. Is that the one was permanent? There is one that was not. Bonus appreciation was the other one. That one is until 2019, I believe, and that is a credit.    But we did those things. A lot of times we had done these in the past, but we just kind of extended it from one year to other, and we did it towards the end of the year, and so you could not plan for it, and so it did not do a lot of good. Well, finally Congress got its act together sort of in a bipartisan manner and got this thing passed, and it should help you to take advantage of the Tax Code out into the future.    First of all, were you aware that this happened, and did anybody get a chance to take advantage of it yet or whatever? Mr. DiMarino?    Mr. DiMARINO. I have been fortunate. I have a lifelong friend and my tax attorney. I have been doing the R&D credit since it first came out, so that it is in the 1980s. I think it was 1986 when it first was implemented. But it is a wonderful tool, and everybody here at this table should take great advantage of it. It is tremendous. Really a tremendous tool.    Chairman CHABOT. I will yield to the gentlelady.    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. You need to have good accountants so that they could provide information to you in a timely----    Mr. DiMARINO. He is one of the Nation's leading experts in tax and R&D credit.    Chairman CHABOT. Yeah. But, to me that would be one criticism of Congress that a lot of times we did this stuff, but we did it towards the end of the year in some gigantic omnibus bill that you throw everything but the kitchen sink in. By the time your accountant has got to go through it and figure out what the heck was in there, it was too late to take advantage of it, and you could not depend on it. But now the stuff that we made, those in particular were permanent.    I would urge all of you to take a look at it because you could buy stuff and take it right off your taxes that year. It is a real advantage, and I would advise all small businesses who may not know about that to look into it.    Another question, and I was going to follow up on something that the ranking member talked about, job training and the skills that you need when you are trying to hire something. I talk to a lot of small businesses in my district, and one complaint that I get is that, you know, we obviously want to have a safety net. If people have been laid off or they have not had employment for a while, something to make sure they can take care of themselves and survive. But sometimes what I hear is unemployment or other things make it such that people will not take the job, you know, at something that the small business could actually afford to pay somebody.    Do you hear this? Is this an experience that you had or want to comment on? Ms. Bland?
