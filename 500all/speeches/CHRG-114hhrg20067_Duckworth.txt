    Ms. Duckworth. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And I just want to take a moment to also express my deep condolences and solidarity with our allies in Belgium, across NATO, and across the European Union. This morning's cowardly terrorist attacks were not only an attack on the people of Brussels but an attack against Europe and civilized people everywhere who condone such horrific acts of terror.    Secretary Carter, in your written testimony, you lay out five evolving challenges that are driving the Department's planning and budget. And I want to focus on the fifth challenge: countering terrorism overseas and protecting our homeland. In your written testimony, you also outline three military objectives to defeat ISIL, and you say the third is the most important to protect the homeland again.    With that in mind, please provide the specific steps the Department is taking to coordinate with its interagency partners to protect the homeland and what actions Congress needs to take to bolster those initiatives, funding, legislative.    Additionally, you mentioned the development of DOD's transregional counterterrorism strategy. Could you describe the pillars of that strategy and how it complements current efforts to deny terrorists a safe haven from which they can train, plan, operate, and launch these kind of attacks, for example, here in the homeland?    Ms. Duckworth. Thank you. I am very interested in the Jordan initiative, and perhaps I will have my staff follow up with your office, if that is possible.    Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Mr. Gibson.
