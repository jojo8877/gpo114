    Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, would like to welcome the panel. Thank you for appearing today.    Mr. Davenport, you talk about a system that verifies taxpayer identities and tax return information before the IRS accepts a return. How would this work in practice?    Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Given the IRS cybersecurity challenges, as well as those of taxpayer identity theft and refund fraud, how do we ensure that the taxpayer online portals you recommend are secure?    Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Okay. I am running out of time here.    I wanted to ask Mr. Sepp, the current audit process seems to be a bit of a mess based on a number of issues you identified: lack of centralized management, lack of transparency, flawed IDR process, et cetera. But it appears that many of these issues could be resolved administratively within IRS. What recommendations would you make to the agency to make the process work as intended?    Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
