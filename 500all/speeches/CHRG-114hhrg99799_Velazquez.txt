    Ms.  Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I am sorry I wasn't here to listen to your testimony, but I was in a markup in the Small Business Committee. We just finished. But I want to thank you all for being here.    And I have just one question, to Mr. Bradshaw.    My district in New York City, which encompasses communities on New York City's Lower East Side and Red Hook, was especially hard hit by Superstorm Sandy.    In a January 2014 report published by the GAO, some stakeholders noted that the rate increases associated with private-sector flood insurance could lower a home's market value. Some stakeholders also expressed concern that whole communities with a high risk of flooding, like those in my district, could become economically unviable if the increase in premium rates makes flood insurance unaffordable for too many residents.    Mr. Bradshaw, how do we ensure premium rates on flood insurance do not rise to such a level that it causes homeownership rates to decline, particularly in vulnerable communities?    Ms.  Velazquez. Thank you.
