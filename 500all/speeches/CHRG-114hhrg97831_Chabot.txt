    Mr. CHABOT. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Just a couple of questions. In order of their value to small businesses, and I would ask each of the panel members if they would like to weigh in on this. Which of the various so-called tax extenders do you believe are the most important and would you most strongly encourage us to extend? And maybe we will start at this end here, if that is okay.    Mr. CHABOT. Thank you.    Mr. Kriebel?    Mr. CHABOT. Okay, thank you.    Mr. Shavell?    Mr. CHABOT. Thank you.    Mr. Nichols?    Mr. CHABOT. Thank you.    I have been on this Committee for about 20 years and have talked to an awful lot of small business districts in the past in my district, but now being chair of the Full Committee, talking to folks from all over the country, and the one word that I always heard over and over was uncertainty was the biggest concern that they had, and that is what comes out of Washington. And I have only got a half minute left. Does anybody have a real world example of how this kind of uncertainty on these extenders or any other tax items is really adversely impacted or we could have done much better on something if we had just gotten it done up here? Anybody got anything in particular that they would like to bring before the Committee? Yes?    Mr. CHABOT. Okay, thank you.    Mr. CHABOT. Yes, Mr. Shavell. Yes.    Mr. CHABOT. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
