    Mr. Payne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.    Commissioner, while the recent VWP legislation prohibits individuals with recent travel to citizenship in Iraq, Iran, Sudan, or Syria from traveling to the United States under the program, it authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue the waiver, if in doing so in the law enforcement or National security interests of the United States.    What circumstances would warrant a waiver? What process will be used to determine whether a traveler would be issued a waiver? What role will CBP play in that process?    Mr. Payne. To the both of you, if Congress were to temporarily suspend the VWP, what would be the ramifications for State and DHS? What impact would there be on embassies and consulates in VWP countries? What impact would there be on CBP operations? Also, what impact would there be on U.S. business interests and U.S. travelers to VWP countries?    Mr. Payne. Ms. Johnson.    Mr. Payne. My time is up. I just think, Mr. Chairman, those are some things that we should keep in the back of our minds, as we move forward on this discussion.    I yield back. Thank you, sir.
