    Mr. Emmer. Mr. Secretary, thank you again for all your time today. Mine is a question I wanted to ask you relates to something that really shouldn't be partisan as at all. It is about America's economy and the opportunities that it should provide for American workers and entrepreneurs.    You have long been an advocate for trade, long before this position, and I would like to ask you to give me some details so that our friends on both sides, regardless of political persuasion, understand how important the economic opportunities presented by Trade Promotion Authority and the possibility of getting trade agreements are to our national security.
