    Ms. DeGette. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to ask--Mr. Kennedy, I wanted to ask you about some of the efforts in Colorado. As part of the successful AWS-3 auction, NIST, which as--has labs in Colorado, received $300 million for research on standards, technologies, and applications to advance wireless public safety communications. Now, my understanding is that this research is in consultation with FirstNet, so even though NIST only recently received the funding, I am wondering if you can give us the status of those consultations?    Ms. DeGette. Yes.    Ms. DeGette. Great. OK, good. Now, you told some of the other members that FirstNet has worked hard to improve its outreach efforts to all stakeholders, including States, and--as well as NIST, I understand you have had an official consultation with the State of Colorado. Can you tell me what is next for FirstNet in Colorado?    Ms. DeGette. So that will be sometime in the fall, you think, maybe? Didn't you say September----    Ms. DeGette. Yes.    Ms. DeGette. Right. OK. And, lastly, Adams County, Colorado, has one of the five early builder public safety projects. What lessons do you think you could learn from that project in Adams County?    Ms. DeGette. Right.    Ms. DeGette. Thanks. Thank you very much. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
