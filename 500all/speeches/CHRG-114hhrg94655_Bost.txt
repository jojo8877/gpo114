    Mr. Bost. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Just a real quick question, because I noticed in your written testimony, and when we were looking that over, and you may not know the answer to this but if you can find it out, one of the things you talked about was a specific project. It was a Kinkaid Reeds Creek Project. And I am very, very familiar with that, and as a matter of fact, I was around when the lake was--I was around driving with my grandfather in a truck when the dam was built for that, okay? And when it was built, we knew that the watershed was a very quick watershed, and it is a very deep lake, but the project that you worked on is a silting on the north end. Are you familiar enough with the project, because what I am going to ask--and if I can't get that answer today, I would like to get it in writing. I know you are working with the different groups to try to stop the silting from coming in. Is it to the point that you have slowed it enough, and if it is not slowed enough, can it be slowed enough that then we can dredge that north end, and take the depth of that particular water reservoir back to where it was. The water's depth is good now, but we need to make sure that we get it back down to the depth, and I didn't know if we were to that point or not.    Mr. Bost. Okay.    Mr. Tidwell.--we are moving forward with some additional projects this year.    Mr. Bost. Yes, that particular one I do want to compliment you because we knew when the lake was built, the conversations was the watershed was so fast, matter of fact, the engineers of the lake told my grandfather at the time, someone said how long do you think it will take the lake to fill, and they said, ``Well, it will take about 5 years,'' and he said, ``It will fill this spring,'' and it did.    Mr. Bost. It did.    Mr. Bost. That is how fast of a watershed it is: everything from farming practices to what the Forestry Service has done as well, and so thank you. And just if you can let me know, thank you.    Mr. Bost. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. All right. Well, I want to take the opportunity to ask an additional question, and provide an opportunity to other Members to keep an eye on the time clock, that is all I would ask, in terms of getting in for votes.    Chief, you put a lot of value in terms of the tools that retain receipts for restorative work has had, and the numbers show that out. And I do appreciate the trend overall in harvesting, but I really want to focus in on the greenstick, and I wanted to focus in on how the restoration has an economic benefit, there is no doubt about it, in terms of local jobs on those projects. The lifeblood, economically, of our communities where we have National Forests is in good timber harvesting. And you know that. You know that better than I do. And even on the Allegheny, we have gone--and these are general numbers, I looked at them yesterday. When I was first elected, my first term was serving as Ranking Member with Mr. Holden, who was the chair, we were somewhere around 13 million board feet total, and the total cuts have gone up every year, and we are at 30 million board feet--38 million this past year, and we are somewhere around 13-14 million just in the first quarter of this year.    But my concern is, of last year's number of 38 million board feet, which is going in the right direction, there were only about 12 million board feet, 12 to 13 million, that actually were greenstick. They were actually the kind of timber harvesting that makes big differences economically, and on a larger landscape perspective. So if that is the case, and the President's plan--within your testimony, you talked about how the plan to go from 2.9 billion board feet to 3.2 billion board feet, and that is addressing wildfires and there are issues out there, but my concern is we have to do balanced here because we are leaving our rural communities behind and we are just crushing them. We have schools that had received hundreds of thousands of dollars, are down to like maybe $80,000. It is not good. So my question is, to retain receipts, and we don't give you the authority to do that, restorative is all we do now, we don't do it on the greenstick. I don't know if there is a better way to describe that. That is the words I use. It is interesting, we do provide the Corps of Engineers authority to have retained receipts for greenstick harvesting, and so we have a precedent, but we have not done that for our Forest Service to keep at least part of that money on the forests so that we are paving the way to more good productive timbering that helps everybody. It helps our National Forests, obviously, but it also helps our rural communities.    So I wanted to get your response to that. If retained receipts was a good thing for restorative, do you see a reason why, and this authority would have to come from Congress, obviously, you don't have that today, but do you see that would be a tool that would be helpful? It has obviously helped restorative harvesting timbering increase significantly.
