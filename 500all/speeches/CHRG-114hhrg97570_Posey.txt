    Mr. Posey. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Gerstenmaier, we know that planning for the ISS began 20 years before it was actualized, and now we're less than ten years out from the administration's proposed extension to 2024. Does NASA have plans for some sort of station in low Earth orbit beyond 2024, perhaps some sort of public/private partnerships? Perhaps there are current international partners for an ISS replacement? Or does NASA intend to leave any LEO station entirely to commercial companies?    Mr. Posey. Now that's great to hear. Our government is investing in capitals, Orion, Dragon, CST-100, Cygnus. Most capitals are optimized to get crew and cargo back and forth to the ISS. What role will capitals play once the International Space Station reaches the end of its life?    Mr. Posey. That's great. The Space Shuttle and X-37, both examples of reusable spacecraft that lands on a runway also have had track records of success. Has NASA completely ruled out the use of reusable runway-capable vehicles for crew or cargo in the future?    Mr. Posey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
