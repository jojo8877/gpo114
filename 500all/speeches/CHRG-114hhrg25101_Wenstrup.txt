    Mr. Wenstrup. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    If I can just add to that, I would hope that we don't have to keep adding layers upon layers because layer one isn't being done. Now you have layer two of writing letters saying, hey, it is not this guy's fault. I mean, thank you for doing that, but that is not the answer obviously.    My next question is, what does the individual, the patient, the veteran do, and what does the physician do when these claims aren't getting paid? Is there a customer service branch that they can reach and have the same person to talk to when they call about the claim either from the doctor's office or on behalf of the veteran or are they just--because I have been getting reports that every time they call, it is somebody different and they have to start all over and wondering where this is taking place?    Mr. Wenstrup. And I appreciate you acknowledging that, and I hope that it can be more fluent, if you will, but also hopefully less of a need for that. Again, another layer that could be reduced if we are doing things right.    You know, you talked about the complexity of all the various eligibilities and that is true. And I would throw out there, you know, sitting here, and you are involved with it, if there are ways that we can reduce that complicated process from this side of things, let us know what those are, you know. We would love to hear from you on that. And I imagine you will gather some ideas as you get more and more familiar with it. And I hope that you give us some feedback in that regard.    Mr. Wenstrup. But I do think at the same time there will always be some variables as far as eligibility. But it seems to me that an algorithm can be built. You are in this classification, you are in that classification, push the button and let the claim roll. Because hopefully, it is not that complicated, but if it is giving us the opportunity on this end to change things, if we need to that, is fair to the veterans and gets the job done. And I do not know if you want to comment? If anyone else would like to comment on that any further? But anyway.    When it comes to where you are headed, and there is a claim, there is usually a review of the claim when it comes from the provider. Do you anticipate, especially if you go outside the VA to process claims, do you anticipate the review to come within the VA? Or at that other claims processor?    Mr. Wenstrup. Thank you. And I yield back.
