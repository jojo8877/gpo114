    Mr. Mullin. Thank you, Chairman Pitts.    And it is an honor to be able to sit on a subcommittee panel with you and introduce a Nico Gomez, our CEO of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority. Nico has brought in a unique approach to sometimes an agency that can be bogged down with bureaucracy by looking outside the box, by understanding that there is always a better way to do things. As he openly admits, it wasn't his idea but it was his ability to hire good people which we constantly refer to in the private sector as being extremely smart. And he brought in an outside look by being able to get people to enroll at a simpler pace by being online. At the same time, and most importantly, it gives people and it gives the agency the ability to check the eligibility of the participant at any given time with the touch of a button. Instead of having to go through and audit them to see if they are eligible since it is based on a month-to-month income basis, they can simply push the button and find out their eligibility.    I think it is something that not just Oklahoma can benefit from but the entire country can benefit from.    So, Mr. Gomez, it is an honor to have you in D.C., even though his flight didn't get in until 3 a.m. This morning. And as you can tell, he is still drinking coffee. So Nico thank you so much for being here.    Mr. Pitts, thank you so much for the ability to introduce him.
