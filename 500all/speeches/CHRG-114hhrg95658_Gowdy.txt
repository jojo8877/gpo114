    Mr. Gowdy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. George, I want to start by encouraging you to take heart when the other side makes ad hominem attacks. It's generally because they have neither the facts nor the law nor, frankly, logic. So I know it is difficult for you to sit there and absorb ad hominem attacks, but the reality is that is kind of the last vestige of folks who have nothing else left to argue.    I'm going to ask a series of questions, and Mr. Camus, or Mr. George, either one can answer them. And I'm a simple man, so I'm going to start kind of simply. With respect to the IRS investigation/targeting investigations, were there at some point subpoenas in place?    Mr. Gowdy. Okay. Were there requests to preserve evidence in place?    Mr. Gowdy. Were there ongoing congressional investigations?    Mr. Gowdy. Were there ongoing IG investigations?    Mr. Gowdy. And purportedly, there was an ongoing DOJ investigation, although we've seen scant evidence of that, at least that's the allegation, right?    Mr. Gowdy. Okay. So you have subpoenas in place. You have requests to preserve evidence in place. You have ongoing congressional investigations. You have ongoing IG investigations. And you may very well have an ongoing DOJ investigation, all of which leads me to ask, what does it mean, ``Do not destroy/wipe/reuse any of the existing backup tapes for email?'' What does that mean?    Mr. Gowdy. Oh, so it means exactly what it says?    Mr. Gowdy. There's no hidden meaning?    Mr. Gowdy. Even I can understand that sentence. Don't do it, right? I mean, you can call--you can use fancy words like degauss if you want to, but don't destroy, wipe, reuse any of the existing backup tapes.    Now, was that done?    Mr. Gowdy. Was it done after any of the following were in place: Subpoenas, requests to preserve, ongoing congressional investigations, ongoing IG investigations, or purported DOJ investigation?    Mr. Gowdy. Wow. Now, I want to ask you about an individual in a minute, but I want to ask you this: Sometimes things can be done accidentally. Let's go ahead and rule that out. Are we talking about just kind of a misstroke on a keyboard? Is that what causes these things to disappear and be wiped? You just--you type in a word and hit the wrong key? Does that do it?    Mr. Gowdy. Well, sounds like it'd be hard to accidentally do that.    Mr. Gowdy. All right. So we can rule out accident. That leaves negligence or intentional, willful, wanton. Do you know whether it was just sheer negligence, incompetence, or was it a higher level of scienter or mens rea?    Mr. Gowdy. Was Mr. Koskinen in charge of the IRS at the time?    Mr. Gowdy. I want to ask you about another name. Have you ever heard the name Kate Duval?    Mr. Gowdy. Who is Kate Duval? Because I think I've heard that name before too.    Mr. Gowdy. Oh.    Mr. Gowdy. So she's in charge of making sure that emails and other matters get produced?    Mr. Gowdy. Is she still with the IRS?    Mr. Gowdy. Do you know where she is now?    Mr. Gowdy. No, I know where she is now. She's at the Department of State in charge of their email productions. Wow.    I yield back.
