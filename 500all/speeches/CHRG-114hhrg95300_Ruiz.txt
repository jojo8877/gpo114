    Dr. Ruiz. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, our territories are a part of our Nation. Their residents are a part of our Nation. And, in fact, by an Act of Congress, they are American citizens. And yet, too often, our territories are left behind in major Federal legislation. The result of this inequality comes in the form of health disparities, severe income inequality, and in some cases, substandard living conditions.    For example, territory residents who have paid into the Medicare system do not have access to the same benefits they would be due as a state. The statistics on the disparities in Puerto Rico specifically are appalling. According to Puerto Rico's Medical Licensing and Studies Board, the number of physicians in Puerto Rico has dropped by 13 percent in the last 5 years, contributing to the severe primary health professional shortage in 34 medical under-served areas across Puerto Rico.    Compared to the states, Puerto Rico has less than half the per capita rate of emergency medicine physicians, which oftentimes serve as the individual's last safety net resource. And the reimbursement rate for physicians practicing on the island is said to go down even further, exacerbating these disparities. The people of Puerto Rico deserve to have access to the health care services that they have paid for, and deserve the opportunity to lead a healthy, full life. So I would like to ask you a question if we have enough time.    This question is for my colleague, Representative Pierluisi. How does Puerto Rico's territory status specifically harm the health and wellness of Puerto Rico's residents?    Dr. Ruiz. So you have 1 minute. What is the solution?    Dr. Ruiz. Well, as a physician, I care very much in reducing those disparities, and ensuring that the citizens in Puerto Rico have the opportunity to live a life of wellness and a long, prosperous life, as well. Thank you.
