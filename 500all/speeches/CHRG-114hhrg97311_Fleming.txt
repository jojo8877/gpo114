    Dr. Fleming. The Subcommittee on Water, Power and Oceans will come to order.    The subcommittee meets today to hear testimony on H.R. 3094. Opening statements at today's hearing are limited to the Chairman, the Ranking Minority Member, the Vice Chair, and a designee of the Ranking Member. The bill's sponsor will also have an opportunity to provide an opening statement on his bill. This will allow us to hear from our witnesses sooner.    Parenthetically, we expect votes in about an hour, so we will probably have to recess for one vote series, and then we will continue the hearing.    At this time, I yield myself some time for an opening statement.    Dr. Fleming. Today, the subcommittee will conduct a hearing on H.R. 3094, the ``Gulf States Red Snapper Management Authority Act.'' Since our hearing in December 2014, while there have been several major developments related to the policies governing the fishery, not much has changed in terms of outcome. The Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery is still a mess. The status quo is unsustainable, which leads us to the bill before us.    Let's start by looking at a bit of context. The red snapper fishery is a key economic driver for many Gulf communities. Private anglers contribute to a growing support industry that includes everything from boat building to tackle shops. The charter for-hire boats make use of that economic infrastructure as well, but also bring in tourism dollars. Finally, commercial fishermen deliver their product throughout the Nation, and also contribute to tourism, as award-winning chefs use commercially caught fish in culinary masterpieces.    Leaving aside the economic benefits, these are large, beautiful, and tasty fish that are prized by fishermen and consumers alike. Anyone who has been on the water, or even just witnessed the impressive catches in photographs, can understand the allure of catching red snapper.    This fishery once supported a 180-day recreational season. Despite rebuilding success, recreational seasons have been drastically shortened over time. Even after quotas were adjusted upwards to account for a larger-than-expected stock assessment, private anglers got only a 10-day season in Federal waters for 2015. These shortened seasons have real consequences in the economies of coastal parishes and counties.    I understand the ongoing and increasing frustrations of the recreational fishing community. We have held hearings in this committee on how NOAA counts fish where they do not live, and neglects where they do. We have also looked at some of the state data collection programs, like LA Creel, and how they are superior to NOAA's data collection; but NOAA does not incorporate the data from their states.    This is a controversial topic, with the recreational, charter, and commercial sectors all competing for a share of a growing, but still rebuilding, resource. We will hear from all of those interests today, and I am glad to have that dialog.    I am hopeful that we can continue that dialog to find a solution that everyone can live with. It is critical that we ensure plenty of fish for future generations, and that we are exercising responsible stewardship over the resource.    H.R. 3094 would transfer management of the red snapper fisheries from the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council to a newly created Gulf States Red Snapper Management Authority. The bill's sponsor pointed to the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act and the Dungeness Crab Management Act as precedents, and I look forward to examining the similarities and the differences with those management schemes.    The states have made a lot of progress in shaping this plan since the hearing last year. But there are a few outstanding questions: how will Federal enforcement work in these newly designated state waters for a state-managed plan, how will disputes between the states be settled, and how can all of Louisiana's economic and cultural interests best be protected.    While we hope to find answers to these questions today and in the coming weeks, it is still clear that something has to change to allow the recreational community better access to this important resource.    I want to thank all the witnesses for coming to testify and share their expertise and passion on this issue. I hope that we can have a productive dialog that leads to a solution.    Dr. Fleming. The Chairman now recognizes the Ranking Member, Mr. Huffman, for his opening statement.    Dr. Fleming. The gentleman yields back. I thank the Ranking Member.    At this time I would like to ask unanimous consent that Mr. Scott sit in with us today.    Dr. Fleming. Hearing no objection, so ordered.    The Chairman now yields to the Vice Chair, Dr. Gosar, for his statement.    Dr. Fleming. The gentleman yields back.    The Chair now recognizes the bill's sponsor, Mr. Graves, for his statement.    Dr. Fleming. Sure, go ahead.    Dr. Fleming. Coming from north Louisiana, I take issue with that.    Dr. Fleming. The gentleman yields back. And at this time the Chair would like to introduce our first panel of witnesses.    Mr. Robert Barham, Secretary, Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries from Baton Rouge; Mr. Alan Risenhoover--did I say that correctly?--Director of the Office of Sustainable Fisheries for NOAA from Silver Spring, Maryland; Mr. Nick Wiley, Executive Director of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission from Tallahassee, Florida.    Let me remind witnesses that, under our Committee Rules, you must limit your statements to 5 minutes. The light system, which I think most of you are familiar with, is that you will be under a green light for 4 minutes. For the last minute, you will be under a yellow light, the caution light. When it hits red, we ask you to quickly conclude. I promise you every word in your statement, even if it has 10,000 words, will be entered into the record. So we will get everything that you have to tell us today.    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Barham, Secretary, Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, to testify for 5 minutes, sir.    Mr. Barham, do you have your microphone on? Is it on?    Dr. Fleming. Be sure it is pulled closer to you. Yes, there you go. It is hard to hear you if your mouth is not close to the tip of the microphone----    Dr. Fleming. Very good. Much better.    Dr. Fleming. Thank you, Mr. Barham.    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Alan Risenhoover, Director of the Office of Sustainable Fisheries at NOAA, to testify. You have 5 minutes, sir.    Dr. Fleming. I think we have the same problem with the microphone. Make sure--very good.    Dr. Fleming. Thank you, Mr. Risenhoover.    Next the Chair recognizes Mr. Nick Wiley, Executive Director of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for 5 minutes. Be sure that you are close to the microphone.    Dr. Fleming. Thank you, Mr. Wiley. That completes the opening statements of our witnesses. We have a pretty good number on the dais today, and I think we will have very interesting questions. Therefore, I yield 5 minutes to myself for the first set of questions.    Mr. Risenhoover, solve a paradox for me. I am having difficulty understanding this. I think I may know at least part of the reason for this. In the period where the fish stock has recovered--we are talking red snapper--the sizes are getting bigger, the numbers are getting bigger, the poundage allowed is getting larger, but yet we have seen a substantial reduction in the number of days for recreational fishermen. What has changed to make that occur?    Dr. Fleming. Limited in time. I would love to hear more, I really would, I just do not have time.    Basically, what you are saying is more people are fishing. Is that accurate to say?    Dr. Fleming. OK. That all makes sense. Are you seeing any increase in one industry versus another? That is, commercial versus charter versus recreational?    Dr. Fleming. Well, again, I only have limited time. I would love to hear it all.    So, where we see a sharp reduction is in the recreational side, would that suggest that we have had a sharp increase in recreational fishermen versus the other two sectors?    Dr. Fleming. Sure, OK. It sounds like--it is partly more fishing, more accessible fishing, and also bigger fish. Obviously, if the fish are twice as big, that is going to cut in half the poundage that is allowed under the same limit. So I get that. OK.    Also, back to you, Mr. Risenhoover, can you describe to me how NOAA currently estimates the number of fish caught by the recreational community?    Dr. Fleming. OK. So you are open to using other technologies that are being developed. But it is still kind of an indirect--you do not count every fish like you can with commercial, but you use some sort of indirect methodology, maybe sampling. You have people at docks, I suppose. And I think also--well, I will not get into that, because, again, my time is limited.    How would the states counter-estimate the recreational catch under the state plan? Oh, I am sorry. Let me ask our state witnesses.    Mr. Barham, under the state plan how would that be accomplished, as opposed to what NOAA does?    Dr. Fleming. I think all sides agree that we need better technology on tracking what the catches are.    My time is up. I recognize the Ranking Member.    Dr. Fleming. The gentleman yields back. Mr. LaMalfa is recognized for 5 minutes.    Dr. Fleming. Yes, fine.    Dr. Fleming. Yes. OK, the gentleman yields back. Mr. LaMalfa yields back. The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Guam.    Dr. Fleming. Without----    Dr. Fleming. That is between you two on that.    Dr. Fleming. Yes, exactly. Without objection, Mr. Lowenthal.    Dr. Fleming. Mr. Lowenthal, can you get that microphone a little closer, please, sir?    Dr. Fleming. The gentlelady's time is up; but we will come back to you soon, Mr. Lowenthal. The Chair recognizes Mr. Graves for 5 minutes.    Dr. Fleming. All right. Mr. Lowenthal is now recognized for 5 minutes.    Dr. Fleming. OK. The gentleman's time is up. The Chair now recognizes the Chairman of the Full Committee, Mr. Bishop.    Dr. Fleming. Very good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And last in the first round we have Mr. Scott. You are recognized for 5 minutes.    Dr. Fleming. OK. The gentleman yields back. To the first panel, we thank you. Great job. We may have more questions for you that we may provide to you later in writing. We would appreciate a response within 10 days. You are now excused, and we ask the second panel to step forward.    While the second panel is coming forward, I will go ahead and begin introducing them in the interest of time.    First is Mr. Christopher Horton, Fisheries Program Director of the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation from Bismarck, Arkansas; Captain Gary Jarvis, Owner of Back Down 2 Charters from Destin, Florida; Mr. Bob Zales, President of the National Association of Charterboat Operators from Hurley, Mississippi; Mr. Jason DeLaCruz, President and COO of Wild Seafood Company from East Madeira Beach, Florida; Ms. Haley Bittermann, Corporate Executive Chef and Director of Operations for Ralph Brennan Restaurant Group, New Orleans, Louisiana; and Mr. David Cresson, Executive Director and CEO of the Coastal Conservation Association from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.    If everything goes right, everybody is sitting in the correct order. I cannot see all the names. OK, we are good.    OK. Our panel of witnesses, we thank you for joining us today. Let me remind you about our Committee Rules. You must limit your oral statements to 5 minutes, but the entire statement will appear in the hearing record.    I will also explain about the lights. You will be under a green light for 4 minutes, then a yellow light for the last minute. The light turns red quickly--conclude your statement.    We will probably be called for votes in about 15 minutes. We will try to get through the entire panel, if at all possible. Then we will recess and come back afterwards for questions.    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Christopher Horton, Fisheries Program Director at the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation to testify.    Dr. Fleming. Thank you, Mr. Horton.    The Chair now recognizes Mr. Jarvis for 5 minutes.    Dr. Fleming. Thank you, Mr. Jarvis. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Zales, President of the National Association of Charterboat Operators.    Dr. Fleming. Sorry, Mr. Zales. Your time is up and we do want to get the other witnesses in before we recess.    Dr. Fleming. OK, Mr. Zales, thank you for your testimony. Mr. DeLaCruz, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF JASON DeLaCRUZ, PRESIDENT AND COO, WILD SEAFOOD     Dr. Fleming. Thank you, Mr. DeLaCruz.    Ms. Bittermann, you are recognized for 5 minutes.    Dr. Fleming. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Bittermann.    Next and last, but not least, David Cresson, Executive Director and CEO of the Coastal Conservation of America (sic).    Dr. Fleming. Thank you, Mr. Cresson. All of this talk about crab and fish is making my stomach growl.    Dr. Fleming. We are going to take a recess to go vote. It will take us about an hour. We will be back, and we will then get started with questions. Thank you.    Dr. Fleming. Well, we have finished voting, so we return. We thank you for your patience and indulgence, panel, for staying around. I know we have a couple of Members who may have to leave before we are done. So, we will wish you safe travels when you leave, but we want you to stay as long as you can.    At this point we will begin asking questions, and I now yield myself 5 minutes.    Ms. Bittermann, you have made mention of the fact that there have been some fish that have not remained commercially available. My concern, of course, is that New Orleans, which is really kind of the gateway of culture and many things for Louisiana, and all the great restaurants that we have--certainly one of the Brennan restaurants that you work at, and the many others that are notable that have been in families for well over a century--these are the kind of things that draw people to Louisiana.    So my concern is--and we have lost fish sustainability in certain species before--my concern is going forward. So, would you like to expand on the concern that we may have that, by expanding private angler fishing, recreational fishing, what has happened under that type of management, state management, in terms of sustainability for commercial use, and certainly availability in restaurants for consumers?    Dr. Fleming. Sure. The other thing I would, again, maybe just throw this out to our witnesses and get comments--under the five-state plan, is it possible that as few as three of the states in the plan can declare a state--for instance, Louisiana--non-compliant, and recommend the Secretary of Commerce close fishing down entirely? Yes, go ahead.    Dr. Fleming. I see. Any others who would like to comment on that?    Dr. Fleming. Right. Now--oh, yes, go ahead.    Dr. Fleming. But couldn't the logic be applied to the current situation today under the Gulf Council, under the Federal program, that there has been a sharp drop in the number of fishing days? One could make the same argument in support of that, as well.    Dr. Fleming. OK. Thank you. And my time is up. I recognize the Ranking Member for 5 minutes.    Dr. Fleming. Thank you. Mr. Graves is recognized.    Dr. Fleming. OK. Mr. Scott, 5 minutes.    Dr. Fleming. Somehow I am going to regain control here.    Dr. Fleming. Well, the gentleman's time is up, but if Members would like to have another 5 minutes each, and the panel is willing, we will be happy to have another round.    I have no further questions, so I will yield to Mr. Graves for another 5 minutes.    Dr. Fleming. OK. The gentleman yields back. I want to thank the witnesses----    Dr. Fleming. Without objection, so ordered.    Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,                                    Montgomery, Alabama 36130                                                 September 23, 2015Hon. Garret GravesU.S. House of Representatives204 Cannon House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515    Dear Representative Graves:    On behalf of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR), I am pleased to support H.R. 3094, the ``Gulf States Red Snapper Management Authority (GSRSMA) Act.''    Red snapper is one of the most valuable recreational and commercial fisheries to the State of Alabama. Orange Beach, Alabama, is well-known as the ``Red Snapper Capital of the World.'' Even though Alabama has less than 5% of the Gulf of Mexico coastline, more than 30% of all red snapper caught in the Gulf of Mexico are landed in Alabama. The management of this most sought after species is of the utmost importance to our State. We have worked diligently through the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council and the National Marine Fisheries Service to sustainably manage red snapper. However, the current federal management system is not working.    The federal data collection methods currently being utilized, as well as the red snapper stock assessments and management strategies, have resulted in shorter and shorter seasons at the time when our state scientists, fisheries managers and fishermen feel that the stock is recovered and growing. Along with our counterparts in Mississippi, Texas, Florida and Louisiana, Alabama is confident that the five Gulf states have the ability to provide the data collection and assessments needed to better manage this fishery and improve access for anglers while maintaining a viable commercial red snapper fishery. The Marine Resources Division of ADCNR is in close contact with the recreational, charter and commercial fishermen on our coast and can better assess the needs of the fishery and respond accordingly to ensure access while sustainably managing this most valuable fishery.    Thank you for your work on this issue. I look forward to continuing to work with you, Representative Bradley Byrne from Alabama and the other members of Congress to provide relief to our fishermen and better sustainable management of the red snapper fishery.            Sincerely,                                        N. Gunter Guy, Jr.,                                                      Commissioner. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission,                                       Tallahassee, Florida                                                     August 6, 2015Hon. Garret GravesU.S. House of Representatives204 Cannon House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515    Dear Representative Graves:    On behalf of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), I am pleased to support H.R. 3094, the ``Gulf States Red Snapper Management Authority (GSRSMA) Act.''    The Gulf of Mexico is one of America's great natural resources. Tourists from the United States and the rest of the world flock to the Gulf of Mexico to enjoy everything it has to offer: world-class fishing, beautiful beaches, great food, and diverse wildlife.    Unfortunately, fishing for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico is becoming more and more challenging for all parties involved because of the manner in which red snapper is being managed. This uncertainty and challenging environment is leading to increasingly more dissatisfaction for all.    GSRSMA is a step in the right direction for anglers and conservationists. By joining together with our colleagues in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, FWC believes the five states in the Gulf of Mexico are better equipped to manage the red snapper fishery, to establish and meet conservation goals based on sound scientific data, and to respond faster to the needs of all anglers.    Representative Graves, thank you for your leadership on this issue. FWC looks forward to working with you, Congressman Jeff Miller, your colleagues in Congress, and our colleagues along the Gulf to advance this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                Nick Wiley,                                                Executive Director.                                 ______                                                     Department of Wildlife and Fisheries,                                 Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70898                                                     August 7, 2015Hon. Garret GravesU.S. House of Representatives204 Cannon House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515    Dear Representative Graves:    On behalf of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF), I am pleased to support H.R. 3094, the ``Gulf States Red Snapper Management Authority (GSRSMA) Act.''    Red snapper is an iconic American fish--it is well-known and appreciated by both residents and visitors of Louisiana, whether it is on the end of an angler's line or on a diner's plate at one of our fine restaurants. Both recreational and commercial fisheries for red snapper are extremely important to our economy and way of life. We should take great care in managing these fisheries for the benefit of all users. We should strive to have sound data to guide our management decisions and seek out solutions to ensure our fisheries are ecologically and economically sustainable.    As such, we are especially troubled with the current management of Gulf red snapper, namely management of the recreational fishery, as it continues to face challenges due to inadequate data and an inflexible, unresponsive management framework. The GSRSMA Act would address these challenges. Along with our colleagues in Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, LDWF is confident the five Gulf states have the necessary tools to provide the data needed to better manage red snapper fisheries, improving access for recreational anglers while maintaining a viable commercial fishery. We are also more receptive and responsive to the wants and needs of our constituents while still addressing Gulf-wide conservation goals.    Representative Graves, we appreciate your leadership on this issue. LDWF looks forward to working with you, your co-sponsors and colleagues in Congress, and our colleagues along the Gulf to advance this legislation.            Sincerely,                                             Robert Barham,                                                         Secretary.                                 ______                                               Mississippi Department of Marine Resources,                                    Biloxi, Mississippi 39530                                                 September 24, 2015Hon. Garret GravesU.S. House of Representatives204 Cannon House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515    Dear Representative Graves:    On behalf of the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources (MDMR), I am pleased to support H.R. 3094, the ``Gulf States Red Snapper Management Authority (GSRSMA) Act.''    Red snapper is a valuable recreational and commercial fishery in Mississippi. We have worked diligently through the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council and the National Marine Fisheries Service to sustainably manage red snapper. However, the current federal management system is not working or at best working too slow.    The federal data collection methods currently being utilized, as well as the red snapper stock assessments and management strategies, have resulted in shorter and shorter seasons at the time when our state scientists and fisheries managers believe the stock is recovered and growing. I am confident the five Gulf States have the ability to provide the data collection and assessments needed to manage this fishery and improve access for anglers while maintaining a viable commercial red snapper fishery. The MDMR hosted a Red Snapper Summit in May of 2014 and have remained in contact with the recreational, charter and commercial fishermen to ensure access while sustainably managing this most valuable fishery.    Thank you for your work on this important issue. I look forward to continuing to work with you, Representative Steven Palazzo from Mississippi and the other members of Congress to provide our fishermen the best opportunities and access to this valuable fishery.            Sincerely,                                           Jamie M. Miller,                                                Executive Director.

Garret GravesU.S. House of Representatives204 Cannon House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515Re: H.R. 3094--Gulf States Red Snapper Management Authority Act    Dear Congressman Graves:    As Chairman of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, I write to express my strong support for H.R. 3094, a proposed amendment to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, for the purpose of transferring to the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, the responsibility and authority to manage red snapper fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.    Recent history has demonstrated that management of red snapper fishing in federal waters has been uncertain, arbitrary and has not been based upon sound science. Although the numbers of red snapper have dramatically increased in recent years, federal management has led to inequities and has made it difficult for the states to manage state waters. There can be little question that the current system has failed and caused significant dissatisfaction among red snapper anglers.    The proposed bill is a positive step that in my view, will be supported by conservationists interested in this fish. H.R. 3094 would require each of the five states to establish a science-based fishery management plan and then submit that plan for approval by each of the other four states. I believe that the state agencies who work with this fish in these waters are better equipped to manage the fishery and to establish and pursue conservation goals founded on scientific data. Each of the states is also able to move quickly when necessary to respond to any challenges that may arise in the fishery.    I look forward to working with you and your colleagues in Congress and our counterparts in the other four Gulf states, regarding this important bill. The mission of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department is to manage and conserve the natural and cultural resources of Texas and to provide hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations. I am excited about this bill and believe that it provides the best assurance that present and future generations of snapper anglers will enjoy improved red snapper fishing in the future.            Sincerely,                                           T. Dan Friedkin,                                                          Chairman.                                 ______                                     Dr. Fleming. I want to thank the witnesses today, and Members and staff.    Look, folks, this is a controversial issue. It has been controversial for some time. There are certainly some points of agreement. Number one is that we all want sustainability of the species. We want good management. We want good science. These are things that we all agree with. I hope that we agree that we want to keep all three sectors strong: the private anglers, the recreational people; the charter boat people, they have to have a minimum number of days in order to stay viable, as a business model; and, of course, the commercial fishermen, who are supplying our restaurants, which is so important.    Again, it is my hope, and certainly dream, for working as Subcommittee Chairman for a number of years now, that we can come together in a common solution.    But I do thank you for the work. We have had plenty of hearings in the past, I am sure we will have more. You are welcome back any time. Under Committee Rule 4(a), the hearing record will be held open for 10 business days for any responses that you may have to additional questions that we may provide to you in writing.    Therefore, without objection, we are adjourned.
