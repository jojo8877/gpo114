    Mr. O'Rourke. Mr. Francis, I was very interested by your comments about opportunity costs and that when we have cost and time overruns, it is not just money and time in an absolute sense; it is the loss of something else that we could have been focusing on, spending dollars on, spending time on. I know it is hard to quantify a negative, but do you have any examples of what some of those opportunity costs were, specific programs?    Mr. O'Rourke. You also talked about the fact that we unintentionally incentivized, overpromising on the outcomes and underestimating on the costs, and you suggested that this committee or Congress should send a signal by rejecting some of these programs or projects or systems. Do you have any specific examples?    Mr. O'Rourke. Could you think of some examples where Congress should have said no?    Mr. O'Rourke. Let me ask you about another topic that you brought up, which is the need to take risks earlier in the cycle or in the process. Can you expand on that a little bit and talk about our role in doing that or in creating the incentives for that?    Mr. O'Rourke. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    Mr. O'Rourke. Thanks.    The Chairman. Mr. Wittman.
