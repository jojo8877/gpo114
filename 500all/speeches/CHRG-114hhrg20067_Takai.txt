    Mr. Takai. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Secretary Carter, I would like to talk about the Rim of the Pacific exercises, or RIMPAC. In your letter last year to Senators McCain and Reid, you stated that you believe that China's participation in RIMPAC would advance cooperative approaches to common security challenges, increase transparency and mutual understanding, and integrate China into a cooperative forum. You also say that you may modify our defense engagement decisions based on evolving circumstances.    My question is, have you recently evaluated China, and have you made any changes to the invitation to the PLA navy to participate in this year's RIMPAC?    Mr. Takai. Okay. So if China builds a runway on Scarborough Shoal reef, PACOM Commander Admiral Harris assesses that Beijing will have total access across the South China Seas.    Secretary Carter, is China conducting or preparing to conduct reclamation at the Scarborough Shoals, which is only 120 miles from Subic Bay in the Philippines where our Navy regularly operates? And would you say that this behavior is consistent with U.S. objectives and the regional security environment?    Mr. Takai. Thank you. And I do agree, it is not consistent with U.S. objectives, and like you say, no one should be militarizing that area.    So my question, then, is why, then, should we reward China with their aggressive behavior by including them in an event meant for allies and partners? China's behavior is the polar opposite, as you mentioned, of U.S. objectives in the region, and that is why I submitted a proposal to the NDAA that would prohibit China's participation in RIMPAC this year. I hope you and your department will reassess this situation and follow suit. Do you have any comment? Briefly. We have 10 seconds.    Mr. Takai. Thank you.    The Chairman. Mr. Turner.
