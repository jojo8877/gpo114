    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you both, or all of you being here. I appreciate that, and we all do.    Secretary Carter, as you know, Qatar is an important partner of ours. We have troops stationed there, and they have played a role in the counter-ISIS fight.    However, they are playing both sides. There are a number of U.S.-designated terrorist financiers operating openly in Qatar. The leadership of Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, openly operates there and they have been financing some very bad Islamist extremists.    So my question is, how can the U.S. hold them accountable and how can we make it clear that playing both sides is simply unacceptable?    Mr. Lamborn. But, Secretary, I understand that we may disagree on this or that issue, but when their policy is cutting against what we are trying to accomplish in that very fight, I have got a real problem with that.    Mr. Lamborn. Okay, thank you.    Also, Secretary Carter or General Dempsey, on the AUMF, I have a real problem with the two major limitations that the President has put into his proposed language: a limitation on time and a limitation on scope.    Is it right to be tying the hands of this President or a future President in that way?    Mr. Lamborn. And if you have already addressed this, I apologize. I was in another committee meeting.    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.    The Chairman. Mr. Aguilar.
