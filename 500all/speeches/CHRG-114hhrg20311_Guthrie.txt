    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for yielding.    Dr. Gould, my first question is, we are talking about the payment model established in the bill. How large is your practice? And I guess my question is, do you think this payment model would work for different-size practices and would hospitals be able to participate in the demonstration project created by the bill?    Mr. Guthrie. I believe you understand, or know, that CMS is in the process of developing an oncology care payment model. How does the model established in this bill, H.R. 1934, different to what CMS is trying to accomplish, and why is the bill better?    Mr. Guthrie. We always appreciate when groups come forward, and this is an opportunity for us to help you save money within our field, because if it is bottom up, or driven up and brought to us and people are invested in it, and so they really make it work. So, I guess the question is, we all focus on saving money in the spiraling health care costs. But how does this benefit--how would the medical home benefit patients specifically?    Mr. Guthrie. I just have about a minute, and I want to ask one more question. I appreciate your--I think we got what we needed.    Mr. Guthrie. So Ms. Norby, in the piece of legislation that you are here to testify, if it is passed, how would this legislation affect your business and businesses of other small PT clinic owners.    Mr. Guthrie. Thanks, my time has expired. I appreciate the answer. My time has expired. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
