    Ms. Radewagen. Thank you, Chairman Wenstrup. I would like to thank both you and Ranking Member Takano for holding this hearing today, and I would like to welcome the panel.    My question is for Ms. Ansley and Mr. Varela. In your written statement, you mentioned that veterans rehabilitation and employment counselors' caseloads are too high and that additional staffing resources are needed to ensure eligible veterans aren't delayed in gaining services. Short of increased staff, what is something that VA can do right now to reduce the counselor-to-participant ratio, particularly in rural and outlying regions such as the United States territories in the South Pacific?    Ms. Radewagen. Mr. Varela.    Ms. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
