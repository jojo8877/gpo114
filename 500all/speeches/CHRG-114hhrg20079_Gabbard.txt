    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen. A follow-up to Mr. Wittman's question, that was kind of what I wanted to talk about as you spoke broadly about the nuclear threat coming from North Korea to places like Japan and South Korea. Representing Hawaii, this is something that as North Korea beats its drums and makes its threats, Hawaii falls within range of their ICBM capabilities and now the miniaturized nuclear capabilities that they are talking about.    And so this question of our submarines, the projected reduction and the need for us to be able to maintain that is something that is critical. But really, also, the entire ballistic missile defense capability that we are looking at is of paramount importance.    I am wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that ballistic missile defense and where you see that falls into this need for what you talk about a bipartisan strategy, a national security strategy.    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you.
