    Mr. Harper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thanks to each of you for being here and making this effort on such an important issue.    Mr. Fitz, if I could talk to you for a moment, the Department of Energy recently announced its intention to initiate a new permanent repository program for nuclear material generated from National defense activities. As you are aware, Washington State holds about two-thirds of all defense material at the Hanford site. Did DOE consult with the State of Washington prior to making this announcement?    Mr. Harper. Were you advised of anyone that told you, yes, they told us about it, or you just can't rule it out because you are not privy to it.    Mr. Harper. Does Washington believe this new policy would help the Federal Government fulfill its responsibilities under the Tri-Party Agreement between DOE, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the State of Washington?    Mr. Harper. One last area. I understand that the high-level tank waste at Hanford is to be vitrified into large logs that are engineered to be disposed in Yucca Mountain. If DOE pursues a defense-only repository, what will happen with the vitrified waste logs from Hanford, and would this delay the shipment of material out of Washington State?    Mr. Harper. Thank you very much.    I yield back in the interest of time.
