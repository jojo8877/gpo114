    Mrs. Comstock. Thank you.    Madam Chairman, I too appreciate all the hard work that the Committee has done. And I just wanted to recommend, as the Committee is looking through how we can do the sorting and have the transparency that we want and really provide the picture in a better way, Virginia has a system that is called the Virginia--it is vpap.org, is the Web site. It is Access Project. And what it does is it takes all the submissions that we have--this is on the political side, but it would be easily applicable for our MRA--when we submit those documents they are almost immediately able to put them up. And they have a much better sorting system than I have seen on any of the Federal databases that look at our campaign disbursements.    And this is done privately by just a couple of guys. They are privately supported. They are a great resource. And so I would just recommend that the Committee take a look at it. It is vpap.org, v-p-a-p.org. And that Web site is a great model for transparency. Because I know when I put my records in, I actually can see how everything is sorted and how it is spent better than we can do almost ourselves internally. They do it that well.    Thank you.    The Chairman. Very well. Thank you for those comments.    Any other members wish to speak to this amendment? If there are no more comments, we will vote on the gentlelady's amendment. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlelady to the resolution.    All those in favor of the amendment, signify by saying aye.    All opposed, signify by saying nay.    In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it and the amendment is not agreed to.    Mrs. Comstock. No.    The Clerk. Mrs. Comstock votes no.    Mr. Walker?
