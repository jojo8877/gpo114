    Mr. LaHood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Weiss, thank you for being here today, and for your testimony.    In your opening remarks there, I did not hear you talk much about how we get the private sector flourishing in Puerto Rico. When you look at the statistics with Puerto Rico--and one theme is really the poor business climate there, the barriers in place that have kind of been systemic there for a while--and I know you talked about the debt restructuring and the oversight, but in terms of how we change the culture there to get the private sector to flourish--I mean, you read about the regulations, whether it is enforcing contracts, the tax system, registering property.    Traditionally, Puerto Rico ranks very, very low, in terms of doing that. And I know the debt is part of that, but looking at whether we engage in this legislation, how do we reduce those barriers? Because it seems to be a direct correlation to the hemorrhaging of people, talent, and opportunities out of Puerto Rico to Orlando, Florida, and lots of other places. If we do not have that business structure reform, how is this going to work?    Mr. LaHood. Assuming that you get what you want in this, what assurance do you have when it comes to those other things I mentioned that are really prohibitive measures to investing, whether it is the issues with contracts, registering property, taxes--when you say there is a flood of private-sector investment that is ready to come in, if none of those things are changed, why would they come in?    Mr. LaHood. Two follow-up questions. Are there currently any existing Federal laws that, in your view, prohibit the ability to attract private investment in Puerto Rico? That is first. Then, second, are you confident in the legislators in Puerto Rico that these reforms that are necessary and needed are going to get done?
