    Mr. Thom. I would just say it has shown from the monitoring data for both 2014 and 2015 that the survival rate of winter-run Chinook was very low coming out of the Sacramento system over those 2 years.    Mr. Thom. I am sorry, could you repeat the question, I am not sure I understand----    Mr. Thom. Yes, based on the high mortalities in 2014 and 2015 that we saw in the juvenile outmigrants, we expect very few return spawners, very low year classes to come back in those later years.    Mr. Thom. The adult fish returning are counted----    Mr. Thom. The outflows are used through smolt trapping carried out by the California Department of----    Mr. Thom. You don't. You actually subsample some of those.    Mr. Thom. Yes. Thank you. I would just second that. I think in terms of dealing with the changing circumstances in May where the scientists, in terms of temperature profiling, realized there was less cold water in Shasta Reservoir for fish, the Bureau came back to us to revise the plan so that we could maintain temperature criteria. I just want to point out that Mr. Murillo, Mr. Lohoefener, and myself worked together with our staff to come to a plan that actually merged the benefits to smelt and salmon in the system to come up with a plan that would actually work and reach agreement and move us forward this year.    So, I think that has been a success of the agencies working together to get a plan that can actually operate through this year and help protect winter-run fish in the river.    Mr. Thom. OK. And I would just add, Mr. Denham, we have been supportive of predation efforts. We had this conversation before. We are studying it, we are looking at hot spots. I think predator removal, predator relocation, and getting the predators out of these hot spots has been shown to be effective. But there is ongoing research about the predator effects throughout the system and other methods that might be able to be taken to deal with them as well.
