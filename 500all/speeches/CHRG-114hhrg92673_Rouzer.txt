    Mr. Rouzer. Looks can be deceiving.    Mr. Conner, Mr. Hilkemann, I appreciate you all coming forward today. And, by the way, it is good to be up close and personal here.    I have just one quick question for you. I come from a policy background but also a business background as well, and anybody who has been in business understands that time is money. My question is, and we have been all around it, and I am just wondering if there is a concrete answer: How long does it take you to manufacture a plane from start to finish under the regulatory apparatus that we have today?    And then the followup question to that is: If we implement--or FAA is able to implement this risk-based approach that you have outlined several different times, how much does that save you on a time front, or is it more of an efficiency in terms of lower costs so, therefore, you can be competitive as well?    Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Hilkemann, do you have any comment, follow up?    Mr. Rouzer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
