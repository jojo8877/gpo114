    Mr. Gallego. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Like Rep. Coffman, I, too, am a graduate of the University of Al Anbar with the Marines and a graduate degree--I like to boot to that sometimes. From my experience there, just operating out in that area, mostly the, kind of, Haditha, Al Asad, Al Qayyim corridor, I operated a lot with ING , and they were decent infantry soldiers.    Earlier this year, you know, Secretary Carter stated that, while air strikes are effective, we are going to need a good, reliable Iraqi ground force to be able to take back a lot of this territory from ISIL. In your estimation--it doesn't matter which one of you all three want to answer this--are we seeing an effective Iraqi force on the ground right now?    There are some conflicting reports I have read about Ramadi, how there was an overreliance on air strikes and, I think, the special forces of that counterterrorism. And what does this mean in the larger relations of us being able to push them out of Mosul and other parts of Al Anbar too?    Mr. Gallego. Right. Hold it.    Mr. Gallego. Yeah.    Mr. Gallego. In further following up--and I had questions last time we were meeting; I think it was just last week--any idea how many bridges and crossways over the Euphrates are controlled by ISIL at this point?    By what means are they resupplying Mosul? From what I understand, it is getting more difficult but they still have the capability of resupplying Mosul, going through the desert up through Al Anbar.    Mr. Gallego. Thank you.    I yield back.    The Chairman. Mr. Veasey.
