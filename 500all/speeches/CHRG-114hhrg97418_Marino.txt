    Mr. Marino. The Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law will come to order. My colleagues are on their way. But I usually give at least 5 minutes. We've given 7. So we'll get started. I know your schedules are as hectic as ours.    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess of the Committee at any time.    We welcome everyone to today's hearing on H.R. 3438, the ``Require Evaluation before Implementing Executive Wishlists (REVIEW) Act of 2015,'' and H.R. 2631, the ``Regulatory Predictability for Business Growth Act of 2015.'' And I now recognize myself for an opening statement.    Today, this Subcommittee continues its overall regulatory reform agenda by examining the targeted reforms to the U.S. regulatory process contained in two, straightforward bills. I'm honored that we can take a good look at H.R. 2631, the ``Regulatory Predictability for Business Growth Act of 2015,'' a bill offered by my colleague, Congressman Steve Russell of Oklahoma.    H.R. 2631 addresses a recent Supreme Court decision that upended the process by which agencies can change its own interpretive rules. How to address this change is an important question for us to consider today.    Today this Subcommittee will also examine my bill, the REVIEW Act. Over the last decade, our Nation has faced a costly and unprecedented regulatory onslaught. During this period, the size and scope of Federal regulation has ballooned to epic proportions. Longstanding Executive Branch policies have mandated additional scrutiny for ``significant regulatory action,'' i.e., those rules with an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more.    But regulatory uberous has flown past these commonsense concerns as agencies more frequently propose mega-rules with annual cost in excess of $1 billion. But as these monstrous regulations become more frequent, an average of three per year during the Obama administration, and six in 2014 alone, it almost seems that nothing can curtail these potential to damage our economy. This bill is one more step in this Subcommittee's continued effort to put forth commonsense regulatory reform measures for the benefit of American workers.    The REVIEW Act presents a simple premise that massive $1 billion regulations should face full and thorough review by the courts before they become effective and force compliance costs on businesses across the country. It achieves this goal through a simple and straightforward mechanism, a mandatory stay of any $1 billion rule if it is challenged in court within 60 days of its promulgation.    Some observers might insist that the reforms in this bill are unnecessary. But just this summer, in the Supreme Court's decision in Michigan v. EPA, we saw firsthand that irreparable harm can occur as a result of expansive, costly, and poorly-crafted regulation.    In this case, the court found that the EPA has promulgated its Utility MACT rule through a faulty process and on legally infirm grounds because it chose not to consider costs when promulgating the rule. In this case, the costs of the rule were estimated by the EPA itself as $9.6 billion per year. In return the EPA's best estimate of potential benefits were in the range of a mere $4 million to $6 million annually.    As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his opinion for the court, ``One would not say that is even rational, never mind appropriate, to impose billions of dollars in economic cost in return for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits.'' Unfortunately for workers, homeowners, and taxpayers across the country, the Utility MACT rule remained in effect as litigation took years to work itself to a final decision at the Supreme Court.    Over this time, electricity providers were forced to close power plants as they faced uncertain compliance burdens. Jobs were lost, and electricity costs to consumers rose as a result. Until recently, regulations with $1 billion annual price tags were a rare occurrence. Since 2006, however, we have seen 26 in total.    The REVIEW Act is a step in the right direction to address this growing concern. It also provides a bit of certainty to the American people that massive $1 billion regulations must pass legal muster before their costs are passed on. I thank the Chairman for joining me on this bill, and I look forward to hearing from today's esteemed panel.    __________                                                                  Mr. Marino. The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, for his opening statement.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    The Chair now recognizes the Chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, Mr. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, for his opening statement.    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Chairman.    Mr. Conyers, the Ranking Member of the full Judiciary Committee, will be on his way shortly. And I'm going to reserve the time for his opening statement for when he gets here.    And without objection, other Members' opening statements will be made part of the record.    And I will begin by swearing in our witnesses before introducing them. If you would please stand and raise your right hand.    Do you swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth--before this Committee--the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?    Let the record reflect that all the witnesses responded in the affirmative. Please be seated.    We have a distinguished panel with us today, and I want to thank the Members for being here. Seated to my left, the first gentleman, Mr. Brady is the president and founder of Brady Homes Illinois, and the second vice chairman of the National Association of Homebuilders.    He is a second-generation homebuilder. Brady Homes Illinois is a small, single-family building and development company that since its founding by his father, William Brady, Sr., in 1962, has become one of the largest homebuilding firms in central Illinois.    Mr. Brady has served on the NAHB board of directors for more than 10 years and has also held seats on several committees and task forces, including the NAHB Federal Government Affairs Committee and the Budget and Finance Committee. Mr. Brady has been a trustee and chairman of Build-PAC, NAHB's Political Action Committee.

Professor Buzbee graduated magna cum laude with his BA from Amherst College, and his J.D. From Columbia Law School. Welcome, sir.    Each of the witnesses' written statements will be entered into the record into its entirety. I ask that each witness summarize his or her testimony in 5 minutes or less, and to help you stay within the time, there is a timing light in front of you. The light will switch from green to yellow indicating that you have 1 minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns red, it indicates that your 5 minutes have expired.    And what I also do is, you're so intent, as I am, on wanting to communicate and read and talk to us that no one pays attention to the lights. Even I am guilty of that. So I will diplomatically and politely raise the gavel, just twirl it around a little bit to get your attention, and if you are just so that intent on looking I'll just give a nice little tap and ask you to please wrap up. If you would kindly do that.    Okay, we will begin with Mr. Brady and his opening statement.    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Mr. Brady.    Mr. Marino. Mr. Noe.    Mr. Marino. Without objection. And I apologize, sir, I believe your name is pronounced Noe?    Mr. Marino. I apologize for that.    Mr. Marino. Mr. Clark.    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Mr. Clark.    Mr. Marino. Professor Buzbee.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    Mr. Marino. We will now begin our 5 minutes each of questioning, and I will recognize myself to start the process.    Mr. Clark, you suggested that judicial stays are hard to come by, even of high-cost rules, and that they may be getting even harder to come by. Could you provide me with more details about how hard it is and the trend that has been set?    Mr. Marino. Understood.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    Mr. Noe, your statement talks about rules for which it would be important to have protections like those in the REVIEW Act that doesn't rise quite to the revenue act of a $1 billion threshold. What kind of refinements or alternative tests could be added to the terms already in the bill to make sure that we are covering all the rules that really need this kind of automatic stay protection?    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    Mr. Brady, you alluded in your statement from your experience what regulation has done to the construction business. Could you elaborate on what you've experienced because of the regulation?    Mr. Marino. Thank you, sir. My time has expired, and I now recognize the gentleman from Georgia, the Ranking Member, Mr. Johnson.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California, Congressman Issa.    Mr. Marino. Just a moment.    Mr. Marino. Without objection.    Now Mr. Issa.    Mr. Marino. Go ahead, Mr. Buzbee.    Mr. Marino. No? All right.    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New York, Congressman Jeffries.    Mr. Marino. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan, Congressman Bishop.    Mr. Marino. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Congressman Peters.    Mr. Marino. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Congressman Collins.    Mr. Marino. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Congressman Ratcliffe.    Mr. Marino. Thank you.
