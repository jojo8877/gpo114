    Mr. McKinley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for having this hearing. I am curious back on the comment that I think it was you, Mr. Koep, said about the heat pump water heater at around the cost of $1,500. Also labor would be a little higher, too, wouldn't it, installing that?    Mr. McKinley. And so building on that, what kind of payback, what should someone expect to pay back on that?    Mr. McKinley. Yes, 10 years, 15 years?    Mr. McKinley. Even in a place other than--in West Virginia, we are probably paying around 7 cents a kilowatt hour, but in New York it is 19, 20 cents a kilowatt hour. So are you saying generally speaking across the country or are you talking----    Mr. McKinley. OK.    Mr. McKinley. Mr. Nadel?    Mr. McKinley. Yes.    Mr. McKinley. Mr. Koep, back on, you know, we received some promotion--my former firm, we had an architectural engineering practice, and so we were always being promoted to put those in-line electric units so that weren't storing water. We never used those, but how inefficient are they to be able to have instant hot water instead of having a 50- or 100-gallon tank sitting there trying to maintain a low temp or a high temperature for a period of time? How inefficient is it to have just simply the in-line augmented?    Mr. McKinley. OK. The last question more is about efficiency. What should we be anticipating in the industry, should be the next move in efficiency, whether it is hot water heaters or other appliances that we have in our households? What is the next generation of efficiency we should be anticipating?    Mr. McKinley. Sure. Mr. Nadel, do you have a comment about that?    Mr. McKinley. Eventually we have run out of our time, but condensing and non-condensing, I would like to have more discussion about that. Thank you.
