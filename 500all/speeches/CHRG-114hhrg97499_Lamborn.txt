    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having this hearing.    And thank you all for being here and for your hard work.    I would like to ask something to Dr. Clark Murdock, Dr. Keith Payne, and Mr. Elbridge Colby in particular.    There was some talk that there was consideration of further unilateral cuts beyond what New START called for. And I am not sure that that has died down or not, I hope it has. But should that kind of talk be resurrected, would you or any of the three of you advocate for further unilateral cuts on the part of the U.S. of our nuclear stockpile?    Mr. Lamborn. Okay. Given the open sources that have reported that there could be cheating by the Russians on the INF Treaty, does that call into question on the parts of you three gentlemen, again, our adherence to the New START Treaty? And my thought is that we are handicapping ourselves in some ways through New START.    If it is reciprocated that is one thing, but if they are cheating in other areas, will it even be reciprocated? And should we continue handicapping ourselves? That is my question and I would like to get your perspective.    Mr. Lamborn. All right. Thank you all.
