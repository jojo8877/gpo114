    Ms. DELBENE. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thanks to all of you for being with us today and taking the time.    This Congress, the Agriculture Committee has been conducting what has been billed as a top-to-bottom review of programs like SNAP. And the title of today's hearing, How Welfare Benefits Can Discourage Work, makes me think that not enough of us has been listening. SNAP doesn't discourage work. If anything, we have learned that the benefits aren't adequate enough.    Ms. Golden, your testimony talks about available workforce development funding and SNAP employment and training that is only used by a handful of States. In fact, my home State of Washington is one of the leaders in the E&T programs. I introduced a bill last Congress that was the basis for $200 million in new SNAP E&T pilot programs in the farm bill, and I am definitely proud that these pilots are based, in part, on criteria from Washington State's program that has helped participants achieve self-sufficiency.    As you know, these programs differ widely in participation and success across the States, but even at the height of the recession, 60 percent of those enrolled in Washington's E&T programs found employment, and in one study, less than half remained on government assistance 2 years after starting the program.    So I was wondering, Ms. Golden, can you further explain how E&T programs promote, not discourage work when jobs are available?    Ms. DELBENE. And in the end, we should be focused on results we are seeing. In our State we have seen strong results strong results from these programs, and hopefully the pilot will give us innovative new ideas that different States are trying that continue to inform everyone in the program going forward.    Ms. DELBENE. Thank you.    I yield back, Mr. Chair.
