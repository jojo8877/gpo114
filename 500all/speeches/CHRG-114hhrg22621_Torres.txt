    Mrs. Torres. Thank you.    Chief, over the past several years, CBP and the Coast Guard have seen an increase of smugglers using small boats, what is also known as pangas, along the California coast. Can you describe the challenges that you are having detecting and interdicting these pangas on the coastline? It is my understanding that too often you don't know they are there until they are on shore and the smugglers are long gone.    Mrs. Torres. Are you coordinating with local authorities that may have a unit patrolling within their Coast Guard or within their coast?    Mrs. Torres. LAPD, San Diego PD, they all have boats.    Mrs. Torres. Are you providing training for them? Are your officers training with them to help them understand and identify potential risks? Or are they on their own doing this?    Mrs. Torres. It is my understanding that the Coast Guard equipment and vessels have been greatly ignored over the past several years and have not necessarily been kept up-to-date. So how does that equipment or lack of equipment impact your ability to be able to identify and capture this activity?    Mrs. Torres. Going back to the question that was asked, the numbers that I have for, that you are 1,700 agents underdeployed. That is the number that I have. In your recruitment efforts and your training process, how long is your training process and how many drop out during that process?    Mrs. Torres. Okay. What I am really interested in is, after your initial investment in identifying potential candidates and putting them through a background and all of the expense that is associated with checking someone's background, I want to make sure that you are doing everything that you can to keep them in the academy and to graduate them.    Mrs. Torres. Thank you.
