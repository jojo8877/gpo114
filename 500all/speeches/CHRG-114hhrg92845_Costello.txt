    Mr. Costello. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Administrator Fugate, I recall, as a county commissioner, following either before or just following a storm of a significant magnitude, speaking with my emergency services department and them describing the various obligations that they needed to undertake to apply for and ultimately process an application for FEMA disaster assistance grants or grant.    The question is, in looking at the recent GAO report, FEMA was criticized for the significant costs they incurred to administer disaster assistant grants. My question, what is FEMA doing to reduce its own administrative costs as well as the administrative burden often placed on States and locals who are trying to get the assistance to where it is needed for recovery?    Mr. Costello. I can certainly appreciate that balance.    Following up on the Sandy Recovery Act, which you mentioned, the increase in small-project thresholds to $120,000 I think is one of the things you were alluding to in terms of simplified procedures, without suggesting that it should be increased or decreased. Could you share your observations on if further efficiencies or expedited recoveries could be realized if that threshold were modified? Or are you comfortable with where that is? I think that covers 95 percent.    Mr. Costello. Right.    Mr. Costello. Like 95 percent or something like that?
