    Mr. Yoho.--Chairman. I yield back. Thank you.    The Chairman. Ms. Plaskett?    Ms. Plaskett. Yes, good morning. I was looking at your statement, Ms. Trujillo, and I saw that you talked about over-reporting. There are problems of under-reporting and over-reporting, and that then plays a part in your determining whether there are efficiencies in the program. What would be over-reporting, and how would that impact your reports?    Ms. Plaskett. Okay. And could you explain, you may have done it previously, cash transfers? I don't know which witness would best be able to do that for me. What exactly are cash transfers, and how do they work in the food aid context?    Ms. Plaskett. Yes.    Ms. Plaskett. And it is determined by what, the efficiencies in the particular area that that money is going to be used?    Ms. Plaskett. In your estimation, what is the likelihood--are we going to be going to more cash, or will this be stable, or will we still have the continuance of commodities going to these countries?    Ms. Plaskett. So has there been a decrease in commodities going?    Ms. Plaskett. So you say the tonnage goes up and down based on price, or based on the need that are in specific areas that you have identified?    Ms. Plaskett. So if food is costing more, then we are sending less?    Ms. Plaskett. Even if the need is still there?    Ms. Plaskett. And in areas--and I am running out of time quickly. In areas where they do not have their own crops, or the means to purchase any foods, what are we doing in the long-term, aside from just the commodities in those areas?    Ms. Plaskett. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. Mr. King from Iowa?
