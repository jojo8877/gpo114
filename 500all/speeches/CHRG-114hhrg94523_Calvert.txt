    Mr. Calvert. Good morning. The Committee will come to order.    Good morning. Welcome to the oversight hearing on fiscal year 2016 budget for Indian Health Service. Since this is the first hearing of this Subcommittee in the 114th Congress, let me take a moment to congratulate the new Ranking Minority Member of this Subcommittee, Representative Betty McCollum of Minnesota. Betty, you have been a respected leader on this Subcommittee for some time, and I am very much looking forward to continuing to work with you in this Congress, particularly on the many nonpartisan issues under this Subcommittee's jurisdiction such as Indian Health.    Let me also take a moment to congratulate and welcome the newest members of our Subcommittee--not all of them are here--Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada, I guess we will forget about the sage grouse since he is not here today. Representative Steve Israel of New York, Representative Evan Jenkins of West Virginia, Representative Derek Kilmer of Washington. As many of your know, Mr. Kilmer's predecessor, Norm Dicks, was the cornerstone of this Subcommittee for more than 30 years and his leadership can still be felt today. For example, in fiscal year 2009, Chairman Dicks placed a renewed emphasis on Indian health in this Subcommittee that has continued through the three successive chairmen. In fact, since 2010, the Indian Health Service budget as a percentage of the Subcommittee total budget has grown from 13 percent to over 15 percent today.    The President's 2016 proposal would push this ratio to 16 percent by increasing the Indian Health Service's discretionary budget by $461 million, of which $147 million is to keep pace with medical inflation, population growth, salary and benefit costs in order to maintain current levels of service. Fifty-five million is to keep pace with the rising contract support costs, $18 million is to keep pace with the additional staffing costs from new expanded facilities, $35 million is to reduce a critical maintenance backlog that currently stands at $460 million, $100 million is to keep up efforts to complete the $2 billion Health Care Facilities Priority Construction List, and another $35 million is to address the $1.9 billion sanitation facilities backlog.    Two years ago, then-Chairman Simpson convened an oversight hearing to determine whether funding increases in recent years for the Indian Health Service were making a difference. The answer was a resounding yes, but that more needed to be done. Clearly, the 2016 budget proposes to do just that.    However, like the majority of my colleagues in Congress, I am disappointed that the increases proposed in fiscal year 2016 for Indian Health Service and many other agencies are not offset by responsible cuts to lower-priority spending elsewhere on both the discretionary and mandatory sides of the budget. For the majority of us in Congress, the goal here is to reduce the national debt, not add to it.    Nevertheless, there is no doubt that most of us, if not all of us on this subcommittee, agree that funding for Indian Health Service remains a priority in this bill, and we will continue to work with our Subcommittee's allocation to balance funding for Indian Health with other programs in this bill in order to pass an appropriations bill that fairly reflects the priorities of the Congress.    We are pleased to be joined today by Dr. Yvette Roubideaux, now the Senior Advisor to the Secretary of American Indians and Alaska Natives, who had previously been at the helm of Indian Health Service for several years and now patiently awaits re-nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate.    We are also joined today by Mr. Robert McSwain, now Acting Director of the IHS, and formerly the Deputy Director. Mr. McSwain also served as Director of the IHS from 2007 to 2009.    We thank you both for being here this morning and look forward to working with you today and the coming months to review this budget request and to determine which of your priorities can be met in light of the Subcommittee's more limited allocation.    Before we turn to Dr. Roubideaux, let me first ask our distinguished Ranking Member, Ms. McCollum, for any opening remarks she may wish to make.                    Opening Remarks of Ms. McCollum    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, and Doctor, you are recognized for your opening statement.                   Opening Remarks of Dr. Roubideaux    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Doctor, we appreciate your testimony.    You mentioned in your testimony contract support costs, and the budget proposes to fully fund contract support costs in this bill for 2016 and move the funding to the mandatory side of the ledger for 2017. How does moving the contract support costs to mandatory funding help solve the Committee's concerns about, one, the difficulty of accurately estimating support costs before the start of each fiscal year, and B, inconsistencies in contract support cost policies between the Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs?    Mr. Calvert. Well, I understand your desire to get over to the mandatory side of the budget. It seems like everybody is trying to get to the mandatory side of the budget, and that is probably why it is that about 63 percent of total outlays right now is mandatory spending. So it is a challenge, but I understand, where you are coming from. We have shortchanged Indian health for a long time and this is a way to help fix that problem, but we will certainly take a serious look at it.    Your testimony states that the top tribal recommendation is to fully fund contract support costs separately from the services budget. Short of shifting the funding to mandatory spending, which is your desire, and which is outside of our jurisdiction, of course. We will have to have others work on that. Would it make sense to move contract support costs to a standalone account within discretionary spending so that any future shortfalls are not paid for by direct services?    Mr. Calvert. Well, we will work together on that and we will try to figure out how we are going to do this, with that, Betty, questions?    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Ms. Pingree, you are recognized.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Cole.    Mr. Calvert. And I think Mr. Cole makes a good point, that Indian health, unfortunately was lost in the process somewhere, and we ought to take a serious look at and talk to those in the various committees to make sure it doesn't happen again.    With that, we are going to call members in order of their attendance at this point, so Mr. Israel, you are recognized.    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentleman. Next, Mr. Joyce.    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentleman. Next, Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Jenkins.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    A number of us recently traveled over to the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Nation, and the president of the Navajo Nation, President Shelly, told us that the Navajo Nation is projected to have one million enrolled members by 2050. They currently have 300,000 members, and President Shelly told us quite directly that we will not be able to afford them soon.    President Obama's 2016 budget requests an increase of $57 million to partially fund population growth, what is the current population of people eligible for IHS services, and what is the projected population in 2050?    Mr. Calvert. So what is the estimated amount to fully fund population growth in----    Mr. Calvert . In fiscal year 2016?    Mr. Calvert. Okay. So why did the budget request with a total increase of $461 million not fully fund population growth?    Mr. Calvert. Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Cole.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Joyce, do you have any other questions?    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Kilmer, do you have any other questions?    Mr. Calvert. Real quick.                                      Wednesday, February 25, 2015.                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Mr. Calvert. The committee will come to order. Secretary Jewell, I would like to welcome you to today's hearing along with Deputy Secretary Mike Connor. Our hearing today will address the Fiscal Year 2016 budget priorities for the Department of Interior.    Madam Secretary, this is your second formal budget hearing before our subcommittee as Secretary of the Interior. At the outset, I would like to thank you for the opportunities we have had recently to discuss many of the challenges facing your Department and this committee. Funding for fire suppression, Endangered Species Act issues, Indian education, PILT funding, and the severe drought affecting the West, including my home State of California, these are all issues your Department and this subcommittee must continue to address together.    Today's hearing marks the beginning of a very candid conversation about your Department's funding priorities. Overall, the President's Fiscal Year 2016 budget request provides $11.8 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Interior programs under this subcommittee's jurisdiction, an 11 percent increase over the Fiscal Year 2015 enacted level.    While your budget request includes funding increases for many notable programs and priorities, I have an obligation to remind you and everyone in this room that again this year we are operating in a very constrained funding environment. To be frank, I am concerned that your budget request raises expectations that simply cannot be met. As you know, the President and Congress agreed upon statutory spending caps through the Budget Control Act. This budget request ignores those statutory caps.    On this point, let me be very clear. We are bound by the spending caps under existing law, the 11 percent spending increase reflected in your budget request is simply not a realistic outcome. We will do our best to address the highest priority needs, but as we have discussed, any increases to specific accounts or programs will likely have to be offset against other accounts and programs in this bill. While we will not agree on every single issue, I know from our conversations that we both recognize the importance of listening to other points of view and trying to find common ground in solving problems. In that spirit, I would like to mention a few things before we receive your testimony.    First, the challenge of providing adequate wildfire funding each year remains one of the great challenges facing our subcommittee. The cost of fighting wildfires, particularly the 1 percent of the most catastrophic fires that consume 30 percent of the fire budget, continues to grow. Naturally, this puts pressure on every other account in our bill. I want to applaud my good friend and former subcommittee chairman, Mike Simpson, for his continuing efforts to address this issue through his bipartisan legislation, which proposes that we treat catastrophic fires as we do any other natural disasters, like earthquakes, floods, hurricanes. Eight members of this subcommittee are co-sponsors of the Simpson bill.    Another challenge facing the Department and the committee is the Endangered Species Act. The ESA is a well-intentioned statute, but is long overdue for a legislative and budgetary overhaul. The ESA unfairly stacks the deck in favor of listings, creating a cottage industry for those making a living out of suing the government to list species. These lawsuits drive the budget and relegate recovered species to the back burner where they wait, sometimes for 8 years or more until the Fish and Wildlife Service formally proposes to take them off the list. The Fish and Wildlife Service should be held to the same standard for listing and de-listing, and we ought to structure the budget and the law accordingly.    Driving the budget today is a potential listing of the sage-grouse. Western States are leading an unprecedented effort to conserve sage-grouse so that a listing is not necessary. If the Department lists the sage-grouse, American consumers will feel the impact at the gas pump and in their monthly utility bills. The settlement agreement deadline of September 30th, 2015 is arbitrary, and Congress has an obligation to continue to consider whether to override this deadline if necessary. In the meantime, I look forward to our discussion today for the funding increase proposed for sage-grouse in Fiscal Year 2016.    Identifying stable, long-term funding for the payments in lieu of taxes, PILT, is another major challenge. So long as the Federal government continues to propose acquiring more land without guaranteeing that counties will be fairly compensated for their lost tax revenue, serious questions will continue to be raised about more Federal land acquisition, especially in the West. Until a long-term funding solution is identified, PILT will continue putting pressure on the Land and Water Conservation Fund and other programs within this bill.    Lastly, we are in the midst of a drought resulting in far-reaching consequences affecting families and businesses in the West, particularly in my home State of California. This subcommittee is limited in what it can do to address the drought. However, you are in a position to make a difference by ensuring that the Department does not repeat past mistakes that have exacerbated the conditions on the ground.    In closing, Madam Secretary, I want to express my appreciation to your fine professional staff. This is a team effort, and our committee simply could not do its work without your budget shop, the various bureaus, and the folks sitting behind you. Thanks to each of you for the work that you do every day.    With that, I am happy to yield to the gentlelady from Minnesota for any opening remarks she would like to make. Ms. McCollum?               Opening Remarks of Congresswoman McCollum    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentlelady. We are also joined today by our distinguished chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, Chairman Rogers, and thank him for taking time to contribute to this important conversation. Chairman, if you would like to make any opening remarks?                   Opening Remarks of Chairman Rogers    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am also pleased to see that our ranking member of the full committee, Ms. Lowey, is here with us today. I am happy to yield to the gentlelady for any opening remarks she would like to make. Mrs. Lowey?                 Opening Remarks of Congresswoman Lowey    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. With that, Madam Secretary, I am happy to yield to you for your opening statement.                  Opening Remarks of Secretary Jewell    Mr. Calvert. I am happy to yield to the full committee chairman, Mr. Rogers, for his questions.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. I am happy to yield to Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert . Thank you. Just for information, there are about 2 minutes left in the vote. 300 members have not voted yet. .    Mr. Calvert. I have already voted, so I am just going to continue this until the next vote is called, and then I will have a 10-minute recess, and then we will just come right back after the next two votes.    Mr. Calvert. Oh, I am sorry.    Mr. Calvert. I know.    Mr. Calvert. I will not do anything too controversial. .    Mr. Calvert. Okay.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Okay. We will see you in a few minutes.    Mr. Calvert. I am just going to talk just a little bit about the California drought while you are away, how is that?    Mr. Calvert. A first vote round here, a 15-minute vote usually takes a half an hour. As you mentioned earlier, things never are on time around here. Since you have Deputy Secretary Connor with you today, Madam Secretary, and since California is the only one left here, I thought I might ask a question about our drought. As you know, you and Mike are the water masters of the West and the Southwest, and we have been experiencing severe drought conditions, and in my home State of California probably more severe than the rest of the Western States.    Although there was some rain in December, it was the driest January since we have been taking records as I understand. So could you for the record provide an update on the current extent of the drought, what you have learned from the drought crisis in 2014, and how this year compares to previous droughts?    Mr. Calvert. And I am glad to hear that you are using your tools the best way you can, and modeling, forecasting in the future. But as you mentioned, the regulatory constraints, in this case the Endangered Species Act, the biological opinions that you are operating under presently. As I understand, this last storm surge we had, for instance, this small storm, we talked previously about this. But what I hear anecdotally from people in California was they still were not able to pump to the maximum degree possible because of the way some people were interpreting the biological opinion. I think you can pump up, what, to 7,500 CFS in that instance, and I understood you never got to 7,000 CFS. Is that correct?    Mr. Calvert. Right. Some of the critics on the ground would say that you could have operated under the biological opinion, and I know you are operating this very conservatively, but at least 10,000 acre feet or more was lost because of that. And as you know, 10,000 acre feet of water in this environment is a lot of water, but if we get these storm surges from time to time in an emergency that we are in, every drop of water counts.    And so, if we are not endangering any fish, if we are not endangering the smelt, you know, I would continue to emphasize that we need to make sure that we operate that with the maximum flexibility possible to make sure that we get every drop of water we possibly can in this emergency because I suspect this summer things are going to get a lot worse. And I am not sure what the Metropolitan Water District is going to do in Los Angeles, and what others are going to be doing throughout California and the West, but it is a significant problem.    Let us talk about the Colorado River a little bit. What percentage are you down in storage in the Colorado River system now?    Mr. Calvert. The storage in the Colorado River system is how many acres?    Mr. Calvert. Right, and that kind of tells the story in the Bay Delta area. How much storage do we have up there?    Mr. Calvert. So in the long term we have got to get additional storage in that area. And there is a lot of frustration that many years have been spent, and I drafted the legislation originally to do this, and I think that has been 12 years ago.    Mr. Calvert. And how far along are we to the point where we can actually start issuing permits to start developing these water storage projects?    Mr. Calvert. And we understand that, all the work has been taking place. I know that you do not run the EPA. You have enough issues on your table, but it is under our jurisdiction, was involved in every meeting and was there every time, and then they recently have thrown a monkey wrench into the entire process, which is somewhat frustrating because everybody has been working reasonably well together like good boys and girls, and all of a sudden they throw a wrench in this process, is somewhat frustrating.    We have the same frustration with the State Water Resources Board. As you know, recently we had a number of agencies that agreed that we needed more flexibility in the short term to operate the system up in the north, and then for whatever reason, the State Water Resources Board thinks they know best, so they stopped that. Senator Feinstein, myself, and a number of members, sent a letter urging them to reconsider.    But short term, we need flexibility to operate so we can get every drop of water that we can, and long term obviously we need to build this additional storage in the north to make sure that we prepare ourselves. If climate change is occurring, we have to be prepared to capture this water as rain rather than snow, and we have to do what is necessary as quickly as possible.    I am going to recess because I think the second vote is going to start any second. And we will be back in about 10 or 15 minutes, so thank you.    Mr. Calvert. The hearing will be reconvened. First, we will recognize Ms. Pingree for her questions.    Mr. Calvert. If the gentlelady would yield, I think a number of those delisting applications have been going on over the last number of years. Is that not correct?    Mr. Calvert. Right, but those applications were done many, many years ago.    Mr. Calvert. Take, for instance, the Stephens' kangaroo rat, which seem to be propagating very happily out in California. It has been frustrating that that has not been delisted.    Mr. Calvert. A number of them, but that is just pointing out one.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Cole, you are next, but before you begin, I just want to let you all know that we are going to proceed with member questions in the order members arrived after the hearing began. And with that, Mr. Cole, you are recognized.    Mr. Calvert. I just want to use the discretion of the chair to say I agree with the gentleman. All three of us are chairmen of three different committees--Interior, of course, Energy and Water, and Labor. None of want to be in the situation that we are in, but we have no other recourse than to follow the law. And unless the President and others get together and work out some kind of accommodation, we will pass our 12 bills. None of us will like it, but that is what we are going to have to do because we are obligated to follow the law. And with that, I recognize----    Mr. Calvert. Sure, Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. We are going through this process of oversight, meeting with the various secretaries and various committee heads and so forth. I suspect we will have a budget number some time end of March.    Mr. Calvert. Me, too. I really appreciate----    Mr. Calvert. We are going to be talking about the priorities with the various secretaries as we move along in this process. I think we have been very clear from day one that we are operating under present law.    Mr. Calvert. Certainly, I indulge the gentlelady.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Jenkins, you are recognized.    Mr. Calvert. Please let the gentlelady respond.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Joyce.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Stewart.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Amodei.    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Simpson has a quick question for you.    Mr. Calvert. Ms. McCollum, any parting comments?    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentlelady, and I am sure there will be a number of questions that will be submitted for the record. And so, we will be getting that from members for the Secretary to answer.    Given votes and your schedule, we are going to adjourn the hearing. Before we do, I want to mention that members will have additional questions, as I mentioned earlier, and they will submit those for the record.    Mr. Calvert. We thank you for your time and your courtesy. This hearing is adjourned.                                       Thursday, February 26, 2015.GINA McCARTHY, ADMINISTRATOR, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Mr. Calvert. Good afternoon and welcome to the fiscal 2016 budget hearing for the Environmental Protection Agency. Before we begin I just wanted to let everyone know that we are expecting votes at some time. I do not know when. So I hope we can get through the opening statements before then and I hope that there are only two votes, so we will just have a short recess and come right back. I would like to thank everyone in advance for their patience.    Good afternoon and welcome to the fiscal year 2016 budget hearing for the Environmental Protection Agency. Today we are joined by Administrator Gina McCarthy and Acting Chief Financial Officer David Bloom to discuss the President's proposal for EPA's FY 2016 budget. Welcome to the both of you.    Last year, the President proposed a budget that operated within the boundaries of the bipartisan Ryan-Murray Budget Agreement that established how much the Federal government could spend. That budget proposal offered some choices which we agreed with and many others which we did not agree with.    This year, the President sent a budget to Congress that substantially increases both the national debt and the deficit, and fails to balance. Also with this year's budget the administration has shown a willful ignorance for existing spending caps by proposing to spend $74 billion more than what current law allows. It is out of bounds and it offers unrealistic expectations for discretionary spending. Therefore, I suspect that a policy discussion will dominate today's hearing given that there is little merit in discussing the agency's proposed budget in depth.    EPA's budget request is $700 million more higher than it was last year. I am skeptical that the agency needs $700 million more than last year's request, but there is an additional $74 billion in the President's budget, so it had to be spent somewhere. If enacted, this would be EPA's third highest budget ever, falling behind fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and we have no interest in returning to those spending levels.    The agency is proposing to hire more lawyers to work on more rules in what would be the largest regulatory budget ever. Meanwhile, the budget again proposes cuts for water infrastructure and Great Lakes funding.    Further, the budget again proposes to cut diesel emission reduction grants despite the fact that only 30 percent of trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles have transitioned to cleaner technologies. We need to follow the science and increase funding for the DERA Program to accelerate the replacement of older engines with newer, cleaner engines.    So for a multitude of reasons, the President's budget is not a serious proposal. It cuts bipartisan programs in order to fund a partisan agenda. Thankfully, Congress will have the final say.    Turning to policy, you may recall that we had a lengthy debate last year about the proposed Waters of the U.S. Rule, which I believed helped alert the general public to several critically flawed assumptions and proposals within the rule. That debate has intensified, to say the least, throughout the past year, prompting more than one million public comments on the proposed rule and congressional direction to EPA and the Corps of Engineers in the fiscal year 2015 Omnibus to withdraw the interpretive rule.    Also, debate has continued on the greenhouse gas power plant rules, prompting some serious questions about whether EPA has the legal authority to embark on what had been proposed, and those legal questions remain unresolved. When the President directed your agency in June 2013 to propose a rule to regulate greenhouse gases from existing power plants by June 1, 2014, then it is clear that the White House has little interest in how the rule is structured, what the rule says, or the impacts the rule has on American jobs. The White House is more interested in circulating a regulation on a timeframe that is convenient for a term-limited administration.    Similarly, when the White House directs you to finalize a regulation by June 1, 2015, then I question whether the administration has any interest in giving you the time you need to incorporate what the States and public have to say. The White House has locked your agency into an arbitrary deadline in order to lock the rest of the country into yet another bad decision on its watch.    Just last month, the agency indicated that more time was needed to review more than one million comments on the greenhouse gas rule. And shortly thereafter, some groups criticized EPA for stalling. The June 1st deadline is a manufactured deadline. The agency is trying to do too much too fast and the consequences will be too costly.    So we disagree in the strongest possible terms with the agenda this administration has adopted for your regulatory programs. This anti-jobs, pro-regulatory scheme has forced the agency to set aside day-to-day permitting operations consistent with your statutory responsibilities in order to pursue a grossly unpopular agenda that, if implemented, would be devastating to our national economy.    You have a tough job, Administrator McCarthy, and I know you are going to have to defend the indefensible here today. We all want clean air and clean water and a strong, robust economy. It is not a Republican or Democratic issue, and I know that is something you have often said. We both want a healthy environment and job creation, and we just disagree on the best way to achieve those outcomes, but it starts by living within our means. The people I represent in California have to live on a budget that reflects what they can afford and so, too, does the Federal government.    Now, I know all the Members are interested in discussing various issues with you today, so I will save additional remarks for the period following your testimony. I am pleased now to yield to my friend and our distinguished Ranking Member, Ms. McCollum.                    Opening Remarks of Ms. McCollum    Mr. Calvert. I thank the ranking member and we're pleased to announce our chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, Chairman Rogers is here with us today. Thank him for taking time to be here. Chairman Would you like to make any opening remarks?                   Opening Remarks of Chairman Rogers    Mr. Calvert. Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you again Administrator McCarthy for being here to testify today. Please share with us your thoughts regarding EPA's proposed budget for its fiscal year 2016.               Opening Remarks of Administrator McCarthy    Mr. Calvert. Thank you for your testimony. First we're going to recognize the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Rogers.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. McCullum.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Administrator McCarthy, over the past years, I believe, you've fielded every question imaginable regarding agencies Proposed Water of the U.S. Rule, and you've tried hard to clarify what the rule does and what it does not do. Unfortunately, a year later, I believe we are even less confident in what the Rule purports to do. If anything, it clarifies that more water bodies will be regulated, resulting in more EPA permits.    You just testified that, of the one million comments, you believed 87 percent were positive responses where the Corps said that almost 60 percent were negative responses. So obviously, the two agencies are confused and can't agree on what the comments even say. So it's my hope that the EPA would heed these comments, withdraw the proposed Rule and identify where there is common ground before taking additional actions. So on that score, does the EPA plan to repropose the rule after it's finished reviewing and incorporating the comments received on the Rule?    Mr. Calvert. So what's the opposition to just withdrawing and reproposing the revised Rule?    Mr. Calvert. Because I understand the majority of the governors in the United States are opposed to this.    Mr. Calvert. Well, certainly, from my perspective, I'm very sympathetic to small businesses.    Mr. Calvert. And a comment submitted to EPA in October, the Small Business Association believes that EPA should have conducted a small business advocacy review panel prior to releasing the waters of the U.S. rule. The Small Business Administration recommends that EPA withdraw the proposal and conduct a panel prior to proposing the rule, re-proposing the rule. How do you intend to respond to those comments from the Small Business Association to conduct the small business review panel prior to taking additional steps on this rule making?    Mr. Calvert. Well, Administrator, it seems that no matter what the comments are, no matter what the opposition may be, this train is on the track.    Mr. Israel, you are recognized.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, gentlemen. You can bring pizza to this Committee sometime and share it.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. Thanks, Mr. Simpson. Next is Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentlemen. Next, Mr. Stewart.    Mr. Calvert. Sorry. Okay. Then we will go with Mr. Cole.    Mr. Calvert. Okay.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Mr. Cole. Next Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Stewart.    Mr. Calvert. I'm the timer.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Mr. Stewart. He is modest. He still holds the world speed record for flying around the globe so we congratulate our colleague. We will take this as far as we can, we may have to recess for a little while and come back. But go ahead, Mr. Jenkins.    Mr. Calvert. All right, we are going to take a short recess for approximately 15 minutes. We have some votes. We will be right back. Thank you.    Mr. Calvert. The hearing will reconvene. Sorry for the absence. Mr. Joyce, you are recognized.    Mr. Calvert. Actually, I was going to recognize her right after you.    Mr. Calvert. Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. I am going to ask a question, too.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Joyce.    Mr. Calvert. Everybody up here knows that I cannot have a hearing without bringing up California water. This is my opportunity.    Mr. Calvert. Administrator, I am sure you are well aware that my home State of California is suffering the most severe drought conditions the West has faced in recent years. California's biggest water challenge is in Northern California where the rivers of the Sierra Nevada merge into the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta, the hub of the state's water system.    State and water projects draw supplies that travel through the Delta to provide for 25 million people, three million acres of agriculture, 750 different types of plants and animals, and California's $1.7 trillion economy.    Over the years, the Delta's ecosystem has deteriorated, and its 1,100 mile levy system is increasingly vulnerable to failure caused by earthquakes, floods, and other forces of nature.    The decline of the Delta's ecosystem has led to historic restrictions in water supply deliveries, and it cannot be stressed enough the pressing need to improve California's water reliability.    Absent a new course of action, we will have to steal all the water from Idaho. No, that is not the case.    Who put that in?    Mr. Calvert. Absent a new course of action, we will have an economic and environmental collapse in California, and that is true. In response to this need, Federal and state officials, water agencies, and other interested parties have undertaken comprehensive efforts to fundamentally and systematically improve both the state's water reliability and restore the Delta's ecosystem.    This effort is the Bay Delta Conservation Plan. Today is the result of more than seven years of collaboration, scientific analysis, policy review, public input. The BDCP would simultaneously protect California's water supply, improve the Delta ecosystem, through what would be the largest ecosystem restoration project on the West Coast, remove pollutants, invasive species, other stressors harming the Delta environment, and create up to 17,000 jobs.    More than 400 public meetings and briefing's have taken place over the past seven years, and in July of 2014 we saw the close of a 228 day public review and comment period on the draft BDCP and its associated environmental impact report.    In August, your agency raised last minute concerns that have now delayed the progress in getting closure on a new course of action. This is very disappointing to all the stakeholders that have been participating for many, many years.    Administrator, my question for you is does your agency understand the urgency of the situation in the Delta, because without the strategic investment in the Delta, the water supply and ecosystem will continue to deteriorate and jeopardize the delivery of safe, reliable drinking water to 25 million people.    Is your agency actively working along with the other lead Federal agencies, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Reclamation, to resolve the BDCP concerns in a timely manner? We need to get this done.    Mr. Calvert. I have heard from a number of critics, and they felt somewhat that they have had this open process for a number of years, EPA has been at every single meeting, they thought everything was merrily going around, and then all of a sudden, the rug was ripped from underneath the process, and it just kind of halted progress on something that is significantly important to the State of California.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Mr. Simpson.    Mr. Calvert. I thank the gentleman. And we certainly thank you, Administrator McCarthy, for coming here today.    I am sure there are a number of other questions that need to be answered for the record, so we will keep the record open for five days. And we look forward to your timely responses to those questions.    Mr. Calvert. And we will need to work together to find out what your priorities are as we move forward because, obviously, your budget request is not the budget we will be working under, so.                                           Friday, February 27, 2015.    Mr. Calvert. The Committee will come to order.    We have a number of appropriation hearings going on at once, and so we will have other members coming in at various times. I know Defense has a hearing, we just left, to come over here.                  Opening Remarks of Chairman Calvert    Good morning, and welcome to today's hearing on the fiscal year 2016 budget proposal for Indian Affairs. This is an area within the subcommittee's jurisdiction which is a nonpartisan funding priority, and together we have been making a concerted push over the past several years to make incremental improvements in the lives of American Indians and Alaska Natives, particularly in healthcare, education, and law enforcement.    This has been a partnership. I want to thank several of our key partners for being here today to testify. Our first panel includes Kevin Washburn, Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs; Michael Black, Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs; and Charles ``Monty'' Roessel, Director of the Bureau of Indian Education. Gentlemen, thank you for being here today.    For the past few years, at this subcommittee's request, the Government Accountability Office has been another key partner on Indian education matters. What started in 2012 with a seemingly simple question of comparing per-student funding, inside and outside the BIE system, has grown into something much more complex. The GAO is currently in the middle of a study on BIE facilities condition and management, and I have asked them here today to be on the second panel and to give us an update on their progress.    Before we begin, I will just make a few comments about the fiscal year 2016 budget proposal for Indian Affairs. This Administration has put its partners on this subcommittee in a tight spot, by raising expectations throughout Indian Country that we will struggle to meet. The President's budget disregards the spending caps that he signed into law. That is how he is able to propose a $323 million increase for Indian Affairs and a $461 million increase for the Indian Health Service without an offset. But current law requires discretionary spending to stay relatively flat in fiscal year 2016 in comparison to 2015. So this subcommittee's challenge will be to find the money from within, to pay for the ``have-to do's'' and make progress on the ``should-do's,'' all without cutting the popular ``nice-to-do's'' by so much that we cannot pass a bill.    Mr. Calvert. Before we turn to our first panel, let me first ask our distinguished ranking member, Ms. McCollum, for any opening remarks she may wish to make.                    Opening Remarks of Ms. McCollumWednesday, our chairman, Chairman Calvert, told Secretary Jewell, and I think he wisely did so representing the views within his caucus, that many of the budget increases that the Secretary was proposing were unattainable in the current budget situation.    Now, I believe President Obama has offered a plan to eliminate sequestration and get us out of this fiscal straitjacket that the Budget Control Act puts us in. Now members on the other side of the aisle may not support the President's plan, but I do believe, as the chairman said, that it is incumbent on all of us to address these problems.    I for one do not want to have to say that we cannot have these needed increases for Indian Affairs or that we can only do them with radical cuts to other important programs in the Interior and Environment appropriations bill. This is not a process I will be able to support.    But I want to be clear: This is not an extravagant budget. Like many other parts of the Interior budget, when adjusted for inflation, we are currently spending on Indian Affairs less than we did in 2005. In fact, even with the proposed increases in Indian construction, we would be spending just half of what we spent on construction in 2005. I have always appreciated and I am very proud of the bipartisan manner in which this subcommittee has worked together to address Native American needs and programs, and we work together to strive for solutions that enhance and protect Indian self-government and self-determination.    So Assistant Secretary Washburn, I think you would agree, money alone will not solve this problem in Indian Country but I believe that you understand that there need to be significant reforms in the delivery of service to Native Americans.    So I appreciate you and the other witnesses being here today. I look forward to your insights on these important matters. I look forward to your testimony, and Mr. Chairman, I look forward to us working together to find solutions.    Mr. Calvert. Absolutely. Thank you.    Mr. Washburn, you are recognized.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you for your testimony.    With regard to the 183 elementary and secondary schools in the Bureau of Indian Education system so we can direct today's questions accordingly, please differentiate and clarify for us the various roles and responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary's office, the BIA and the BIE.    Mr. Calvert. How about 3 minutes?    Mr. Calvert. While we are on the subject of education, we were out recently in Navajo country and Hopi country, and we saw the condition of some of the schools and obviously throughout Indian Country. It is one of the big issues that is obviously in need of addressing. Ms. McCollum has a school that desperately needs to be replaced. But this list is a lot longer than just those schools. And we had a discussion about thinking outside the box about how--we had a similar situation a number of years ago with Department of Defense schools' condition, and we came up with an interesting way to finance this. As you know, most schools in America are not paid for on an annual budget process. They are paid through bond financing over a 30-year period, and how we can potentially set up a financing mechanism where we do not have to account for the full dollar amount but be able to expand a number of schools that we are attempting to renovate and replace, and get maybe some expert outside financial help to come up with a model maybe looking at the Department of Defense and get a resolution to a large number of these schools quickly rather than just having to come back here hat in hand year after year chipping away at this iceberg. Have you put any thought into that?    Mr. Calvert. I am going to look into this more because I think you have got to find a way to yes on something like this. There has got to be a better way than the way you are doing it now. That is not working. It will be 100 years before we take care of the necessities that you have on the brick-and-mortar side. I mean, that does not address the other issues you have in education but certainly the brick-and-mortar issue has to be resolved. From a business guy's point of view, I would think that would be a relatively simple thing to do if you focus in on it, and understand how you do it and try to get people to yes to get this thing fixed because as Mr. Simpson said, some of these schools are just beyond an embarrassment.    Mr. Calvert. Well, I have some other questions but I am going to turn it over to Ms. McCollum right now and we will get to the panel. Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Cole--oh, Mr. Simpson. Excuse me.    Mr. Calvert. Sorry about that.    Mr. Calvert. Before I go to our next--Mr. Kilmer, one point that we saw when we were up at the Navajo-Hopi country is that there apparently was a Navajo detention center that was underutilized but they did not want to put the Hopis in the Navajo--from our perspective, that did not make a lot of sense but there may be other reasons.    Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Cole.    Mr. Calvert. We are going to recess for 10 minutes and return to this panel for Ms. Pingree, and then we will have our second panel.    Mr. Calvert. The hearing will reconvene. Ms. Pingree, I will let you catch your breath, and you are recognized for your questions.    Mr. Calvert. It would be helpful, though, to iron out any differences before we appropriate construction dollars on these things. If we had known about this, we could have been willing to bump up the funding and resolve this, and if we do need to do this, we need to do this in fiscal year 2016. So we would like to be made aware--    Mr. Calvert. Coming from that industry, I would say the two happiest words a contractor ever hears is ``change order.'' So get your plan set and then build to those plans. Do not modify or change in the middle of a construction job.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Simpson, you had a question?    Mr. Calvert. I have liver damage.    Mr. Calvert. Mr. Joyce, do you have any questions before I excuse this panel?    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. And one last comment. When we were at Moencopi School, we noticed that there were three empty houses. You were there, I think, Kevin, and there was this dispute between the security people and the teachers and so the end result is, the houses are sitting empty for 2 or 3 years. It drove us all crazy thinking wow, what a waste, and hopefully you fixed it since we left and that it is all resolved.    Mr. Calvert. All right. Well, I just hate to see them empty.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you for being here today. Your continued efforts to lead in the face of tremendous adversity, the traditionally high turnover rate in all three of your positions is a testament to the challenges you face. We want to see you succeed, and we hope we can continue to be helpful partners so that you will stick around for a while and see through many of the improvements you are trying to make.    At this time we will excuse you from the table and invite you to take a seat in the front row while I ask the second panel to come up. We will have a brief pause and change signs here.    Now we will shift gears and focus in more detail on the oversight of BIE facilities condition and management. I would like to welcome our witness from the Government Accountability Office, Melissa Emrey-Arras, Director of Education in GAO's Education, Workforce, and Security team. Thank you for being here today, and agreeing to testify prior to finalizing your study so that we can have an opportunity to make any necessary course corrections in the fiscal year 2016 bill.    Exactly 2 years ago to the day, in this room, Chairman Simpson convened a similar BIE oversight hearing in which GAO testified prior to finalizing a study we had asked them to do regarding per-pupil spending. GAO's testimony at that time helped this subcommittee to push this Administration to make Indian education a much higher priority than before. To its credit, clearly, the Administration is stepping up. But I think as we will see today, clearly, we still have a long way to go.    I recognize that we can help close part of that distance with more funding, but not all of it. There are some management and accountability issues and perhaps even some legislative issues that must be addressed before significant funding can follow.    So Ms. Emrey-Arras, welcome and thank you again for being here today. You are recognized for your testimony.                   Opening Remarks of Ms. Emrey-Arras    Mr. Calvert. Excuse me. On that question, how big a roofing job are we talking about?    Mr. Calvert. But this is one school?    Mr. Calvert. How many square feet in the school approximately? Do you know?    Mr. Calvert. And was there any warranty within that contract?    Mr. Calvert. Excuse me for interrupting.    Mr. Calvert. Excuse me.    Mr. Calvert. Is that not illegal?    Mr. Calvert. Okay.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Your written testimony states that you visited 12 BIE schools. Would you please elaborate on the conditions you observed at the schools including any health and safety hazards?    Mr. Calvert. Your statement discusses problems with recent construction of BIE facilities. What were some of the other specific problems you observed?    Mr. Calvert. Obviously, this is a question. Why does Indian Affairs have such poor quality data on the condition of their schools?    Mr. Calvert. Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Ms. Pingree.    Mr. Calvert. Before I go to Mr. Cole, if you can get back to me on that roofing job, it is driving me crazy.    Mr. Calvert. I re-roofed a lot of buildings in my lifetime and restaurants and industrial buildings and the rest, and so I have a pretty good idea of what roofs cost, so there is regional differences, and depending on where you put the roof, but if you can get the square footage, how big the building is. The largest roofing contractor in the State of California is one of my best friends. I am going to have him look through and see--the bid because he can tell me how bad this probably is.    Mr. Cole.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    One point that both Mr. Cole and Mr. Simpson, noticed when we were out there looking at these various properties, that seemed to be a consistent problem was site preparation, not just on the schools and the detention facilities but on the housing. Apparently nobody ever heard of civil engineering before or soil testing and that type of thing, because if you build on a bad site, that could cause a lot of these problems you are talking about. If you have a shifting foundation, that can cause leaks and the rest. But that is why we need to get to the bottom of this.    Mr. Calvert. That is great. That is great. Yeah, we noticed that one of the schools was built next to a flood control channel. It just does not seem like good site planning.    Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you.    Mr. Calvert. Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Calvert. Sure.    Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Ms. Emery-Arras, thank you for your testimony today, especially for GAO's ongoing work in this area. We will be happy to invite you back once the study is complete. It will be interesting reading.    Mr. Calvert. And we certainly want to thank our first panel, Mr. Washburn, Mr. Black and Mr. Roessel.    As I said before, we all want to help you succeed. Our partnership overtures may cause considerable grief but we are sincere. We all have the same goal, and that is to help the children.    So we thank you for your good work, and we are adjourned.
