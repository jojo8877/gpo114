    Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good morning, Commissioner and panel.    You know, I attended the prayer breakfast this morning and seeing the Commissioner here in this special time of season reminded me of life's two certainties of death and taxes. But, you know, I think there may be----    Mr. Westerman. I'll leave that one alone, but there may be a third part, there may be a new certainty in life and that is that your personal identifiable information is going to be stolen at some point.    When the current e-authentication framework was being developed, the National Institute of Standards and Technology informed the IRS that a taxpayer identification number was an acceptable form of identification. Now, I'm going to get real acronym-heavy here because as slow as I talk, there won't be time to answer if I didn't use these acronyms.    In August 2015 NIST informed TIGTA that a TIN is now not an acceptable government identification number for the purpose of authentication. IRS agreed with this update and indicated the agency would take steps to conform to NIST standards.    So my first question is when and how did NIST initially inform the IRS that a TIN was acceptable?    Mr. Westerman. Was acceptable.    Mr. Westerman. All right. So that was in 2011, you said, when it was----    Mr. Westerman. So what steps have you or the IRS taken with this communication you've had with TIGTA to conform to the NIST standards? Are you saying you're not aware that they're----    Mr. Westerman. Okay. And, Mr. George, is the current e-authentication framework compliant with NIST standards? And if not, does that mean that other online services such as online payment agreement, Direct Pay, and Where's My Refund are more vulnerable to compromise?    Mr. Westerman. I yield back, Madam Chair.    Chairwoman Comstock. Thank you.    And I now recognize Mr. Palmer for five minutes.
