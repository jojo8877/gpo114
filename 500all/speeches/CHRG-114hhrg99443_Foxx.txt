    Ms. Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Burwell, I want to follow up somewhat on what my colleague, Mr. Byrne, was talking about in his line of questioning, but first I want to say I have heard from employers who self-insure that this transitional reinsurance fee is particularly burdensome to them, depriving them of resources that could be used instead to create jobs.    You asserted that HHS interpreted the law accurately and appropriately. You claim that the comment period for the NPRM resulted in no objections to the Department's interpretation of the law.    However, most of us believe that the NPRM was drafted in such a complicated way that no one could interpret it in the way your department did, where you used convoluted language to create a loophole to justify your reasoning. Given your dubious interpretation of the law thus far--you have heard members of this committee, and you will hear us say we think you have interpreted it wrong. I agree with Mr. Byrne, you have interpreted it wrong. You are hearing directly from members of Congress that you have interpreted it wrong.    I am now concerned that you are going to find a way to extend the transitional reinsurance program even though the law clearly states that it expires this year. So, could you expand in greater detail your legal interpretation of implementing the transitional reinsurance program contrary to the letter of the law?    Can you commit to this committee that you will follow the letter of the law which states the program must cease collections for the program at the end of this year? Do you plan to distribute funds after 2016?    Ms. Foxx. Okay. So, you consider the transition period time is over?    Ms. Foxx. Okay. When you say ``we have no plans,'' would you be a little more explicit, you will or you will not?    Ms. Foxx. Alright. Madam Secretary, I have some other questions, but Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time and my colleagues, I will yield back the balance of my time.
