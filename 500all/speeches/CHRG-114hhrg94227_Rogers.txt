    Mr. Rogers. I would like to call this hearing on the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces to order.    We have a full morning ahead of us on an increasingly important subject of ballistic and missile defense. We will start with this open hearing and then we will adjourn and move to the HASC SCIF for a closed session with the witnesses to finish discussing things that are not appropriate to talk about in open hearing.    We have an esteemed panel with us today to discuss the missile defense threat that the U.S. has to respond to. We have Mr. Brian McKeon, Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, from the Department of Defense. We have Admiral Bill Gortney, U.S. Navy Commander, North American Aerospace Defense Command, U.S. Northern Command; Vice Admiral James Syring, U.S. Navy, Director of the Missile Defense Agency; and Lieutenant General David Mann, Commander, Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense.    Given the packed morning, I am going to ask the witnesses to summarize their prepared statements in 3 minutes. Your full statements will be submitted to the record.    I want to make a couple quick comments and then will yield to my good friend from Tennessee for any statement he wants to make.    First, I want to thank all of you for taking the time to be here and putting the effort in to these prepared statements and this testimony. I know it takes time and you are all busy. And so I appreciate it. As we prepare to write the fiscal year 2016 NDAA , your testimony will help us to make some very important decisions about what programs we fund and what policies we set in place.    Secondly, I want to state my support for many of the priorities in this year's budget submission I am pleased to see. For example, the roughly $700-million increase for this year in the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system. We have only one ballistic missile defense system capable of defending the homeland. It is about time we properly fund it.    Admiral Syring, you inherited a mess at GMD with that system when you took over MDA . And I think I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that you have rebuilt trust in the system, and I can't overstate how grateful we are for your service. I hope that, when you leave here to go home tonight, you will pass on to your family a great big thanks from this committee and the country for your service.    Admiral Gortney, Lieutenant General Mann, the same for you and your families. You have our respect, appreciation, and gratitude.    Mr. McKeon, as always, we appreciate your civil service as well.    I have concerns with the budget as well. While this year's budget is good, an improvement from recent years, I note it collapses in the out-years. As I plan, I am not sure I agree with the cruise and ballistic missile threat that the United States, our deployed forces, and our allies will get better in the next 5 years.    Likewise, I was deeply troubled by the November 2014 memo to the Secretary of Defense, signed by the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Naval Operations, concerning our missile defense capabilities.    This memo represents the kinds of things many of us have been worried about because of sequestration. Core missions, like missile defense, are difficult to sustain. Our Aegis ships, the THAAD batteries and Patriot batteries are expensive commitments to our regional security. We all know that.    I agree with the former Secretary Hagel that our current BMD policy is sound. To the services, I say missile defense is a core mission. It is not a nice-to-have mission. It is a must-have mission. But we must get you budget relief so that this core mission and all of your other core missions are executable.    Mr. Rogers. And with that, I now yield to my friend and colleague from Tennessee, Mr. Cooper, for any opening statement that he may have.    Mr. Rogers. All right. I appreciate that.    We will start, then, with Mr. McKeon. You are recognized for 3 minutes to summarize your opening statement.STATEMENT OF BRIAN P. McKEON, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY     Mr. Rogers. I thank you.    Admiral Gortney.    Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Admiral.    Admiral Syring, you are recognized.    Mr. Rogers. I thank you.    Lieutenant General Mann, you are recognized.    General Mann. Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Cooper, and other members of the subcommittee, thank you for your continued support of our soldiers, civilians, and their families.    This is my second appearance before this subcommittee and it is indeed an honor for me to testify on the importance of missile defense to our Nation and the need to maintain these capabilities in the face of a maturing threat and declining budgets.    Today I want to briefly summarize some of the missions of the organizations that I support. First, Space Missile Defense Command, SMDC, Army Forces Strategic Command, ARSTRAT, serves as the missile defense force provider in support of our combatant commanders out there.    Secondly, the Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense serves and supports USSTRATCOM on integrating and synchronizing our global missile defense operations.    Turning to the first organization that I mentioned, SMDC/ARSTRAT, we have three core tasks. We provide trained and ready global missile defenders. We build the future force in terms of both capabilities and force structure. And we also evaluate critical technologies to help us stay ahead of the threat. JFCC-IMD, on the other hand, supports operational-level planning and global missile defense operations on behalf of     We execute five critical tasks in support of these responsibilities. We synchronize operational-level planning. We support ongoing operations. We integrate training and exercises and test activities globally. And we also provide recommendations on the allocation of missile defense resources. And, finally, we also advocate on future capabilities.    Today the missile defense threat continues to grow both in terms of sophistication and the number of systems. We, as a nation, cannot afford a decrease in our readiness. That said, we are extremely concerned about sequestration that will directly impact our readiness and our ability to evaluate and test new technologies in order to stay ahead of the threat.    This committee's continued support of missile defense operations and the men and women who develop and employ these systems is essential. Again, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our Nation's missile defense capabilities and look forward to your questions.    Thank you.    Mr. Rogers. I thank you.    And I will recognize myself first for a series of questions. I want the focus of this hearing to be mainly on the implications that these spending caps on defense will create if we go forward with them. I think that the Budget Control Act is one of the most irresponsible things the United States Congress has done in recent memory, specifically, the caps that it has hoisted on the Defense Department.    I would remind everybody that the year before the BCA was adopted, this committee had voluntarily cut over $500 billion out of the Defense Department just to show our recognition of the financial burden that this country was suffering. And then we had no idea that there would be another $600 billion coming behind it the very next year. Those two things together is what really has created this mess that we are in.    But while the members of this committee, the full HASC as well as the subcommittee, I think, all are fully aware of the implications of these continued irresponsible cuts, I think it is important for you all, as the service members, to help describe for the members who are on this committee who will be reading about this hearing exactly what these cuts mean to your ability to continue to defend this country in an effective way.    So, with that, General Mann, I will start with you. Tell us what you think it means to you not just in this fiscal year 2016 budget--because the truth is you all have done a pretty good job up until now dealing with these cuts and keeping a straight face. It is time to start telling us what it means. So I will start with you.    General Mann. Thank you, Chairman.    I think we have to recognize that the threat is not standing still. We see a threat that, like I said in my statement, is growing both in terms of the sophistication of their weapon systems as well as the numbers.    So, in that context, the concern that we have is that a lot of our programs in terms of the modernization of the Patriot force, the improvements to the radar, the missile enhancement segment that we are trying to develop to give us that--to bridge that gap between the Patriot and the THAAD force, the software upgrades that are required--those programs, due to sequestration, could be impacted. They could be delayed. And, again, the threat is not standing still.    Also, in terms of homeland defense----    Mr. Rogers. Before you go further, that 12,000-foot altitude gap between the Patriot and the THAAD, what vulnerability does that create for us? What threat do we have to worry about penetrating that gap?    General Mann. In terms of looking at the CENTCOM area of operations, there are early-release munitions that could be employed within that range that could impact our operations as far as putting munitions on airfields, ports of entry. So that is a critical gap, that we need that missile enhancement to cover that gap that I talked about.    Mr. Rogers. Okay.    General Mann. So, again, in terms of the regional support, the modernization efforts. Also, we have a lot of efforts underway to get after the cruise missile threat that I am sure will be discussed later on today.    The indirect fire protection capability utilizing the AIM-9X missile will help us address that threat. Patriot does have a capability against cruise missiles, but we need to enhance that capability. So those efforts.    And, most importantly, the Army's number one air missile defense priority is the network, the air missile defense battle command network that basically takes all of the assets that we have out there and componentizes it.    Instead of having big units that have to deploy downrange being able to take those units and break them up, it is a little bit more of an affordable way of getting after the business of missile defense.    And, also, making sure that we get away from stovepipe command-and-control architectures out there and have one single integrated architecture that really addresses the tactical-level and the operational-level systems that feeds into C2BMC .    So those modernization efforts will be impacted and delayed and, again, all in the context the fact that the threat is not stopping. Improvements to our homeland defense capabilities, whether it is the GBI reliability that Admiral Syring and his folks are getting after.    Those capabilities as well as long-range discrimination that we need to make sure that we are as effective and as efficient as possible with the limited number of resources, because we will never be able to have enough missiles to address the number of threat vehicles that are out there.    Mr. Rogers. Admiral Syring.    Mr. Rogers. Admiral Gortney.    Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cooper.    Mr. Rogers. Thank you.    The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Franks, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. Go ahead.    General Mann. Sir, Admiral Syring kind of mentioned it.    I mean, number one, we support homeland defense. The 49th Battalion that is up there at Fort Greely, Alaska, and also down in Vandenberg provide that 24/7 capability against the limited threat emanating from Iran and North Korea. National Guard unit full-time. And I am enormously proud of what they do day in and day out.    As far as the Patriots, right now, 60 percent of our Patriot force is either forward-station and forward-deployed. In addition to the capabilities that they provide, they also serve a very, very important role in terms of theater engagement with our partners throughout the region and reassuring our allies out there. And so that cannot be overstated.    Mr. Rogers. I thank you.    The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Lamborn, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Brooks, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. I thank the gentleman.    The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee for some additional questions.    Mr. Rogers. I thank the gentleman.    The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Bridenstine, for 5 minutes.    Mr. Rogers. Thank the gentleman.    The chair now recognizes the gentleman from the great State of Virginia, Mr. Forbes.    Mr. Rogers. I thank the gentleman.    We are going to be called for votes in just a few minutes, but I want to try to get a few more things on the record while we are still in open session.    Mr. McKeon, when you first testified before this committee last December, among the responses to Russia's violation of the INF treaty were some ``defensive options.''    Can you tell me, is modification of our Aegis Ashore site--and I am thinking specifically in Deveselu, Romania--to provide it with some sort of AAW capability that is intrinsic to it on our ships--would that be among those options that you are considering?    Mr. Rogers. I will state to you that I proposed this yesterday to Secretary Carter in open session because I think it is a very important signal to send, that we intend to protect that site and that there are consequences to the aggressive behavior that we have seen recently and the capabilities of those missiles that they are illegally testing.    But, anyway, Admiral Syring, when I asked you about this option last year, you responded it would be essentially a minor hardware and software modification to make this happen. Is that right?    Mr. Rogers. How does the cost and capability compare to other options we could deploy, such as the Patriot battery?    Mr. Rogers. I would like to request that, if you could in the next couple of weeks, kind of get me some information about what you think it would cost to make those modifications to that site.    Mr. Rogers. General Mann, do we have any spare Patriot batteries laying around?    General Mann. No, Congressman.    Mr. Rogers. Would you please also get back to me in the next couple of weeks as to how much you think it would cost if we were to take one of our Patriot batteries which is currently being utilized and move it to Deveselu.    General Mann. Yes, sir.    Mr. Rogers. Thank you, sir.    Admiral Syring, as you know, Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith are actively engaged across the whole committee with looking at how to reform the acquisition process in DOD, which we all agree is broken.    Tell me why is MDA's unique acquisition authority still important.    Mr. Rogers. Under the what process?    Mr. Rogers. Does anybody else feel like they need to offer anything else on that? Great.    All right. There goes the votes. Let me try to get something else in.    Last November the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Naval Operations wrote Secretary Hagel detailing their concerns about their ability to meet combatant commander requirements for missile defense capabilities.    The Secretary, on the other hand, responded that he concluded our strategy is sound and that services should provide viable missile defense capability.    Admiral Gortney--well, this would be for any one of you. Do you share the services, the Navy and Army accept--do your services, the Navy and Army, accept the missile defense as a core mission?    Mr. Rogers. I want to get back to that initial threshold question I started with when I opened this hearing.    Do you believe that you are going to be able to continue to responsibly maintain that core capability at current sequestration spending trend lines?    General Mann. We are going to be challenged. There is no doubt about that. I can tell you that the leadership of the Army closely monitors, almost on a weekly basis, the op tempo that we are going under. And I think what we are really concerned about is the balance between readiness and science and technology investments.    And so we talked about the threat evolving and the fact that we need to make upgrades to our systems and leverage technology. That is at risk under sequestration because we have got to make sure that readiness is there to deploy folks downrange.    Mr. Rogers. Yeah. I guess the thing I am trying to get at is: One thing we know about the military. You all do a lot of planning, and it is the responsible thing to do. You all see what the future holds under the BCA defense spending caps in the out-years going forward.    I am curious to know: Is there a point in 2019, 2020, 2021, whatever, that you say, ``At that point, I have an unfortunately high degree of confidence we will no longer be able to maintain in a responsible fashion that core mission or sustain it''? And that would be for any one of you.    Mr. Rogers. The gentleman from Tennessee wants to ask something.    Mr. Rogers. Before we leave, let me ask one more thing. And this would be for any one of the three of you.    Sorry, Mr. McKeon.    To the extent the Army and Navy are concerned about changing the current acquisition approach for missile defense, where are their alternatives? And where do you see them in the     Mr. Rogers. Okay. With that, we will recess for about 30 minutes. I think we will then be able to get back in 2337.    With that, stand in recess.    =======================================================================                             March 19, 2015=======================================================================                               March 19, 2015=======================================================================                  =======================================================================                             March 19, 2015=======================================================================          General Mann. As noted in the Fiscal Year 2016 Army posture statement, demand for Patriot assets ``exceeds our capacity, significantly limiting options in emerging crises, and exceedthe Army's ability to meet Department of Defense deployment-to-dwell rotation goals.'' A deployment of a Patriot Battery to Romania would require an adjustment to the current worldwide posture and could delay critical modernization of Patriot equipment. However, if directed by the Department, the Army would explore several possible options to provide a Patriot Battery capability to the Deveselu, Romania region. The most cost effective option is a nonpermanent, deployment of a battery from the Continental U.S. to Deveselu. Based on very preliminary analysis, the estimated annual tactical movement and operational sustainment costs for a battery is approximately $7,000,000. This estimate assumes that current Patriot hardware (missiles, launches, fire control, and radar) would be transported to Deveselu and that the battery's manning would be sourced from current Army Patriot force structure. The estimate does not provide for military construction of any personnel quality of life facilities but we expect that, at a minimum, items such as physical fitness equipment, laundering facilities, and some morale, welfare, and recreational assets would be required. Likely force protection infrastructure, such as fencing and personnel for perimeter security, is not included in the estimate. Finally, as with all other Patriot locations, there could be other operational requirements to provide the desired capability.   =======================================================================                             March 19, 2015=======================================================================          Mr. Rogers. There has been quite a bit of media reporting on the possibility of deploying missile defense assets to South Korea and Japan and China's objections to this. Could you speak to these systems? What kind of protection would they provide our allies in the Asia-Pacific region?    Mr. Rogers. Japan already has Aegis ships for the defense of its territory from North Korea ballistic missiles. Can you tell me what value you think Aegis Ashore could have for Japan?    Mr. Rogers. The intelligence community has remained consistent over the years that the Iranians may have an ICBM capability by 2015. Are we still operating under that threat analyses? What more can we do to be adequately prepared to defend against this threat?    Mr. Rogers. At the SASC hearing last week, you stated: ``we want every one of our kill vehicles to be as effective and as lethal as possible, and as well as the means to develop other ways that we can get more kill--kill vehicles into space.'' It sounds like you're describing the old ``Multiple Kill Vehicle'' or current ``Multiple Object Kill Vehicle.'' Is that right? Can you please describe how valuable you think this capability could be?    Mr. Rogers. Please describe your strategy for procurement of the CE-2 block 1 kill vehicle and planned flight tests of that kill vehicle? Is it low risk? Is it consistent with the ``fly before you buy'' approach to acquisition?    Mr. Rogers. There has been quite a bit of media reporting on the possibility of deploying missile defense assets to South Korea and Japan and China's objections to this. Could you speak to these systems? What kind of protection would they provide our allies in the Asia-Pacific region?    Mr. Rogers. The intelligence community has remained consistent over the years that the Iranians may have an ICBM capability by 2015. Are we still operating under that threat analyses? What more can we do to be adequately prepared to defend against this threat?    Mr. Rogers. What is the way ahead on M-O-K-V? How important do you think it is and can we move faster on this program?    Mr. Rogers. Japan already has Aegis ships for the defense of its territory from North Korea ballistic missiles. Can you tell me what value you think Aegis Ashore could have for Japan?    Mr. Rogers. Admiral, what role, if any, do you see for Aegis Ashore for Homeland Defense?    Mr. Rogers. There has been quite a bit of media reporting on the possibility of deploying missile defense assets to South Korea and Japan and China's objections to this. Could you speak to these systems? What kind of protection would they provide our allies in the Asia-Pacific region?    General Mann. While no agreement currently exists, deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system would increase missile defense coverage of both U.S. and allied forces against North Korean's short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. A potential THAAD in South Korea, in addition to the existing Patriot Advance Capability-3 (PAC-3) systems, the Army Navy/Transportable (AN/TPY-2) Radars, and the THAAD currently deployed to Guam, provides expanded defense in the Asia-Pacific region.    Mr. Rogers. The intelligence community has remained consistent over the years that the Iranians may have an ICBM capability by 2015. Are we still operating under that threat analyses? What more can we do to be adequately prepared to defend against this threat?    General Mann. The missile defense community concurs with the accuracy of the Intelligence Community assessment regarding the possibility of Iran possessing an ICBM by 2015. We must continue the Department's ballistic missile defense modernization efforts, to include the long range discrimination radar and the enhanced kill vehicle design. Clarifying details can be provided in the appropriate environment.                                 ______
