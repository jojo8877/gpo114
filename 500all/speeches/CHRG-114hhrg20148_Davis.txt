    Mr. Davis. Those are fighting words where I come from, Madam Chairwoman.    Less of an opening statement, but more of a comment, because I know this process is going to be very quick today. I want to thank you, the ranking member, and all the members of this committee, and especially the staff, for working so hard to do things to address some issues, as the ranking member said, should have been addressed, could have been addressed even years ago.    Simple changes, like allowing Members to share district offices, can really save taxpayer dollars. This is a great step forward. The committee, both sides, the staff worked very, very hard to address issues that are very, very important to staffers not only here in Washington, but district staffers, you know, where I used to work. And the clarifications truly do help them do a better job on behalf of their Member and on behalf of this institution.    So thank you all again for your hard work. I truly appreciate it.    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman from Illinois for his comments.    Any other Member have any comment?    Okay. I will now call before the Committee our first agenda item, which is Committee Resolution 114, a Committee Resolution updating the Guide to Outfitting and Maintaining an Office of the U.S. House of Representatives. Without objection, the first reading of the resolution is dispensed with and the resolution is considered read and open for amendment at any point.
