    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Director Comey, in your testimony, you mentioned how ISIL and other terrorist organizations field potential recruits in publicly accessible social networking sites and via encrypted private messaging platforms. Could you detail the issues that law enforcement is facing due to the end of encryption?    Mr. Johnson. So, in other words, a foreign based person, a foreign person operating from a foreign location using social network such as Twitter can identify a potential target for radicalization, or someone who's already radicalized but who's reaching out to this foreign based person, and then they can take it to another site where their communications are encrypted, correct?    Mr. Johnson. And because they're encrypted, then law enforcement, whether or not it has a warrant or not, cannot discover what they are talking about, even though they know that this foreign-based person is a ISIL member?    Mr. Johnson. Yeah. So now the practical impact of that is what?    Mr. Johnson. Okay. And you mentioned about traditional crimes, domestic crimes, and how encryption hurts your ability to get at domestic criminal activity. Can you talk about how in a case of hot pursuit or exigent circumstances, this adversely affects our ability to keep Americans safe from domestic crime?    Mr. Johnson. Well, thank you for your responses to my questions.    And I'll yield back.
