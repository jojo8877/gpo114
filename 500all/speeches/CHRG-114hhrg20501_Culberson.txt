    Mr. Culberson.  The first hearing of the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee will come to order. It is a privilege to have with us today the Secretary of Commerce, Penny Pritzker.    We have begun our work expeditiously this year. Chairman Rogers has tasked us and each subcommittee to get started early to get our work done as quickly as possible because we have a budget agreement and a favorable forecast for the Senate, we hope, Mr. Chairman to get all 12 appropriations bills done separately, and hope that they will come not only to the floor of the House separately, but to the floor of the Senate separately, and we hope at the end of the year separately be considered by the Congress.    And in keeping with that task, Mr. Chairman, and to keep our schedule moving quickly, we are going to follow the 5-minute rule for questions, and I certainly will not cut anybody off mid-sentence. I will recognize members in order of seniority based on who is present at the beginning of the hearing, and going back and forth, of course, between parties. For late comers, I will recognize those members in the order that you arrive, and continue to go back and forth between the parties until all members are recognized.    And this subcommittee, in particular, has a long history. As you know, Chairman Rogers has told me many times, this is one of your favorite subcommittees. The jurisdiction of this subcommittee encompasses so many good things that we do in helping keep the American people safe, and enforcing our laws, and ensuring that the nation's trade--as the Secretary of Commerce will talk to us about here in a minute--looking after the nation's farmers and workers with the NOAA satellites. We also, of course, have jurisdiction over NASA and the National Science Foundation.    About everywhere you look, the work of this subcommittee is just pure good, and it is one that is a real privilege for me to chair. It is the one committee I truly wanted to chair when I came on Appropriations, and I thank you for the trust you have invested in me, Chairman Rogers, it is a real privilege. And we are delighted to start with you today, Madam Secretary. It is a privilege to have a chance for you to talk to us about the President's 2017 Department of Commerce Budget request.    And as we all know, the Department of Commerce has a number of important functions including the administration of America's patent and trademark laws; preparing for and conducting the Decennial Census; enforcing our trade laws; forecasting the weather; managing our fisheries; and protecting and exploring our oceans; and mapping and cataloging the immense mineral wealth that lies beneath the ocean under America's exclusive economic zone, which, in fact, encompasses about--if you look at the entire EEZ, it is about 50 percent of America lies under the nation's oceans, and there is vast mineral wealth out there, and that is a key part of your responsibility, Madam Secretary.    Now, we on the committee--I know many of the members here share my concern that the budget request you have submitted to us includes nearly a half-billion-dollars in discretionary spending increases, and more than $2 billion in new mandatory spending. Frankly, they are just gimmicks. Including such things as a $10 barrel tax on oil, which is not likely to happen.    So it is important that we focus on the realities that we will actually be able to handle this year in our tight budget environment, and recognize that we are simply not going to be raising taxes on the American people. And so to that extent, the President's budget request is not realistic, and that also makes our job on this committee more difficult. But we do appreciate the work that you do, Madam Secretary, have a duty to our constituents to ensure that their hard-earned tax dollars are spent wisely, and we will make certain that those tax dollars are spent to enforce the law as written by Congress.    We will also be focusing, in particular, in our hearing today about making sure that we are protecting the Internet from foreign governments; ensuring that the 2020 census is going to cost less than the census that was conducted in 2010. We want to make certain, Madam Secretary, that the weather satellite program meets their cost and schedule timelines. And something of particular interest to me and to my predecessor, Frank Wolf, we want to make sure that we are strengthening cyber and information technology security at the Department of Commerce.    But before we proceed, I would like to recognize my colleague and good friend, Mr. Honda, for any remarks that he would like to make.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Honda. It is my privilege to recognize the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Rogers.    The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You do a great job here, by the way.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    The Chairman. Madam Secretary, thank you for being with us. We appreciate your taking the time to justify your budget request.    As you know, last year we all reached an agreement setting discretionary caps for both 2016 and 2017. I am proud that we crafted an omnibus bill for 2016, that adhered to the terms of that bipartisan agreement. It's not always easy to live within your means, but it is necessary and responsible. That is why I am disappointed that the President has chosen to put forth a budget request for your department that is filled with gimmicks in order to side skirt the very same budget caps that he signed into law last year.    The budget you have put before us requests $2 billion in new mandatory funding, making this budget effectively DOA. I mean, we owe over $19 trillion, growing like a weed, but we only appropriate a little less than one-third of Federal spending. Federal spending is going to be $400 trillion; we only appropriate $100 trillion of that.    When I came here, we appropriated two-thirds, now it is one-third. In the last 5 years, in an effort to get at the spending problem that we have, we have cut discretionary spending by almost $200 billion over the last 5 years, and that is an achievement, big time. But, in the meantime, the mandatory spending has grown like a weed and the public is alarmed, frightened, scared, frustrated, mad. And yet here you come with a $2 billion increase in mandatory funding as if you didn't know that would make me mad.    For fiscal 2017, you have requested $9.73 billion in discretionary; that is a 5 percent increase over the previous year. That number proposes increases for nearly every agency, every program at your department. Given current law under the bipartisan budget agreement, that is unrealistic, to say the very least.    It is the job of this committee to ensure that the programs that serve taxpayers well, are funded responsibly. Innovation and job creation are essential to growing the national, regional, and State economies, and despite this unrealistic budget submission, your agency does do a lot of great work, including in my home State of Kentucky.    Over the last 7 years, we have been hit with the war on coal; the loss of over 10,000 coal jobs in my district alone. That is just coal jobs, that does not mention convenience stores, and truck drivers, and grocery stores, and restaurants, and the like.    We are in a depression in my part of the world. They shuttered the AK Steel plant in Ashland. Regions like Appalachia--and we are not alone--that have been forced to try to diversify their economies as a result of the hostile regulatory environment of this administration and emerging energy technologies and have had to think creatively and strategically about what we do next to live.    From the grassroots level, I have worked with our outgoing governor, Governor Beshear, and now the new governor, Bevin, on a regional community development initiative that we have dubbed SOAR, Shaping Our Appalachian Region. It is an effort to try to diversify the economy, to bring new ways to create jobs to replace those we lost.    Last summer, your assistant secretary for economic development, Jay Williams, came down to our area to address the second annual SOAR summit conference; almost 2,000 people. During his remarks, he shared lessons learned from serving as the Mayor of Youngstown, Ohio, and explained how our communities can leverage Economic Development Administration resources to help create those jobs and opportunities that we desperately need for new businesses across the Appalachian region. And I deeply appreciated the time he has spent with us, two years in a row, frankly.    As he mentioned, Commerce has many programs that have helped, and continue to help, these struggling coal mining communities. For fiscal 2017, the President's budget proposes to continue to fund what he calls the Power Plus Program, but does not include a specific funding amount, or propose to continue funding the Assistance to Coal Communities program within EDA. That is despite the fact that Congress has included clear direction in the last three omnibus bills to support coal communities.    I would be remiss if I did not mention--even though it is outside your purview--that I continue to believe that Power Plus is toothless without regulatory relief for these coal mining communities. The war on coal continues. I look forward to hearing your plan for those important programs in the future.    Additionally, the U.S. steel market has been flooded by cheap imports from around the world; they are dumping steel on us. That illegal dumping of steel in America has put many of the U.S. steel makers in jeopardy, like AK Steel in Ashland which is going to close. Across the country, steel companies are closing facilities and sending their employees home. The President's budget requests an increase for the International Trade Administration, but only a small portion is targeted toward enforcement and compliance.    With this continuous increasing pressure on U.S. steel companies, I am very troubled by the allocation of the requested budget increase. I would like to hear about how you plan to address the unfair policies that countries like China are today pursuing to the detriment and death, frankly, of U.S. manufacturers in this country and their workers.    We have many challenges ahead of us, I look forward to working with you throughout the process. Thank you for joining us, we wish you well. I yield.    Mr. Culberson. Madam Secretary, we appreciate your testimony today, and the written statement that you have will be entered into the record. And I would ask, if you could, to please keep your opening statement to 5 minutes so we will have additional time for questions.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Madam Secretary. It is very important for you as you go forward today from our hearing to take to heart what Chairman Rogers has said, and that is that this $2 billion increase in mandatory spending that you are assuming in your request is simply not going to happen, and it does make our job far more difficult; and that is the root of the problem that the American people face. The massive increases in mandatory spending are driving the annual deficit and the debt right through the roof.    So it is very disappointing and frustrating to see the increase that the administration has recommended through you to this subcommittee includes $2 billion in new mandatory spending that are simply not going to happen, and as Chairman Rogers pointed out, breaks the budget agreement.    I also want to mention something to you that is of particular interest and that I hear a lot about from my constituents, and that is Internet governance. We all have a keen interest in protecting the integrity of the Internet. My predecessor, Frank Wolf, was one of the first out of the gate to recognize the threat of Chinese cyber espionage. Frank, quite correctly, spotted the problem that Chinese were creating early on, and I was proud to support him in that effort to protect the agencies under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee from cyber attacks by the Chinese.    So we are all becoming--the whole country's increasingly aware of the threat of cyber espionage. And the committee, in the last couple of appropriations bills, has included language prohibiting the Department of Commerce from relinquishing responsibility for the Internet Domain Name System to any other country. Yet, despite these Congressional limitations, the Obama administration continues to plan to transition this responsibility to the global stakeholder community.    And I noted that at the Chinese government's world Internet conference, China appeared to move back towards their original belief that Internet governance is the responsibility of governments, which is a tenet not acceptable in a final Internet transition plan. We have had a very successful system in the United States of the private sector maintaining that responsibility. The Department of Commerce has overseen that, and we have put very specific language in last year's bill and in the 2016 bill prohibiting the transfer of that responsibility out of the Department of Commerce.    Since the Chinese seem to want to make the governance of the Internet the responsibility of government, I wonder if you could talk to us about why you believe the Obama administration and the Department of Commerce believe it is a good idea for the Chinese to have a say in how the Internet is administered.    Mr. Culberson. But of course, you recognize that we have prohibited any effort to move towards such a transition?    Mr. Culberson. This fiscal year.    Mr. Culberson. I just really want to drive that home because the whole concept of a free, and open, and thriving Internet is completely inconsistent with the way the Chinese government approaches these things, and we want to keep the control of those Internet domain names here in the United States in the hands of the private sector has worked very, very well, so that it does continue to be free and secure.    How would you ensure, for example--if I could, the last question and then I will go to Mr. Honda--talk to us about how you would even begin to protect and address cyber security and privacy concerns, which is something of keen interest to all of us?    Mr. Culberson. Well, in particular what I was driving at, is your understanding of what this proposal would be, what would be the role of foreign governments in the----    Mr. Culberson. OK. Thank you.    Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Madam Secretary.    Mr. Rogers.    The Chairman. Madam Secretary, I mentioned earlier about SOAR, the economic development group we put together with the governor. I visited last--couple weeks ago, I took the chairman of the FCC to two of the poorest counties in the country, very small counties, but where the local telephone co-op had installed high-capacity, high-speed cable--a remarkable thing in that small community. The FCC chairman was flabbergasted.    But one byproduct of that is, the Teleco guy told us that he has 150 people now working out of their homes, doing things for Hertz Rent A Car, and Hyatt Regency, and whatever. Those are jobs they can do at home even if they are homebound. So one of the major goals of SOAR is to lay 4,300 miles of high-capacity, high-speed cable, statewide, starting in eastern Kentucky.    So, Mr. Honda, in competition with your Silicon Valley, there is going to be Silicon Holler.    Mr. Culberson. To follow up on that very quickly, Madam Secretary, what specific enforcement actions have you taken? You talked to the Chinese Premier, you are worried about it. I think Chairman Rogers raises a very good question, we certainly hear it in the presidential campaign, it is resonating with the American people. You have a tool kit at your disposal, this committee has given you the resources you need. What specific enforcement action have you taken against Chinese companies dumping steel in the United States?    Mr. Culberson. What I was driving at is, you know, talking to the Chinese does not help, working with them does not help, they are not likely to do this of their own free will. When have you dropped the hammer on them and actually hit them with a tariff?    Mr. Culberson. That is what I am asking.    Mr. Culberson. Give the American people and Chairman Rogers some good news here.    Mr. Culberson. That was the point of my question----    Mr. Culberson . Because Chairman Rogers is exactly right, time is of the essence. These American jobs are disappearing and the Chinese will--they do not pay much attention to anything else.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much.    Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. And we will be paying close attention, Mr. Chairman, and aggressively watching this. Thank you.    Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Palazzo.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Madam Secretary.    Judge Carter.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Judge. Before I go to Mr. Honda, if I could very quickly, I want to bring to your attention, something I think I talked to you about last year. I know that the National Institute of Standards and Technology is responsible for creating the cyber security standards for the government, as well as you just mentioned the Cyber Commission at NIST is working with the private sector to see what those standards should be for everything from police cars to electric grid.    I have to tell you, I just got this assignment last January and one of my first meetings was with the interim director at NIST last spring and he really worried me, because he came into my office and said very cavalierly that he was allowing foreign nationals to come into NIST headquarters with flash drives and laptop computers. He alarmed me so much because I know of the problem of foreign nationals coming in with--I think if you walk into the Pentagon with a flash drive, you go straight to prison, I believe. Judge, is that about right? And I was deeply concerned.    So I asked the FBI to go out and meet with your folks out there at NIST. I understand from my committee staff that the FBI is satisfied that some improvements have been made. Could you talk to me a little bit about that? Because that is just unacceptable to allow foreign nationals with flash drives and laptops to walk into the center of where the United States Government is developing cyber security standards for the government and for police cars to the electric grid. I hope you have got a good handle on that.    Mr. Culberson. One of the other things I asked you to do was to be sure that you involve the FBI on a regular basis to come out and conduct reviews to ensure that that level of security was satisfactory in the eyes of the FBI. I think the FBI is truly the gold standard when it comes to protecting this Nation against a cyber attack. Is the FBI still reviewing on an ongoing basis how you are handling this at NIST?    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Palazzo.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    Madam Secretary, half of the United States actually lies under the ocean and under the exclusive economic zone of the United States, and the Office of Ocean Exploration and Research conducts mapping--oh, excuse me, Mr. Carter, forgive me.    Mr. Culberson. Excuse me, I am sorry about that.    Anyway, I want to ask, in the budget request that you submitted to the committee you propose cutting that program by nearly 40 percent. Yet the mapping that they are doing, the cataloging of the mineral resources that are out there is extraordinarily important, particularly in light of the fact that the Chinese have locked up 98 percent of the world's rare earth elements and it is already apparent that there are vast amounts of rare earth elements out there.    That is an extraordinarily important program that the committee strongly supports. I am very passionate about it, and could you talk to us about why you proposed cutting that program by nearly 40 percent? I hope that is not something that you intend to do. I would hope you will be as strong a supporter of that program as this committee is.    Mr. Culberson. Well, I will pass to Mr. Carter, but I want to recommend to you that the work being done for example by Dr. Robert Ballard and the Nautilus in the private sector, he matches every dollar that you invest and that NOAA invests in the work that the Nautilus does, he matches it with at least two dollars of private funding and they are doing extraordinary work. So I hope that you will continue to support that program aggressively, because it is a great benefit to future generations.    Mr. Culberson. And I recognize Mr. Carter.    Thank you.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    Madam Secretary, there is a common theme here that the Chinese have continued to be one of the worst actors in the world when it comes to stealing intellectual property, whether it be dumping steel or currency manipulation, but I have to tell you, we just have not heard enough. I am glad to hear you have imposed some tariffs.    What sanctions has the Administration imposed on the Chinese for the theft of intellectual property?    Mr. Culberson. My impression is there have not been any sanctions. I mean, this is the equivalent of cyber warfare that the Chinese have declared on us some time ago and it really is about time the United States hammered them back. This is just not acceptable.    When you go to these briefings with the FBI, you discover that the Chinese have engaged in the largest theft of property probably in the history of mankind. It is an extraordinary loss of intellectual property. Mr. Carter is exactly right. Small companies, large companies, on a massive scale we are seeing a level of intrusion that is absolutely unheard of. They stole all the government records on government employees. And if it had been semi-tractor trailer trucks backed up to a government office loading file cabinets, I think the level of outrage would be greater, but that is essentially what the Chinese government has done.    So I hope you gather of course from the questions that you have heard from all of us here today that we are counting on you and this Administration to respond, whether it be dumping steel, theft of intellectual property, protecting the Internet, protecting our privacy as Americans from governments around the world attempting to interfere in the way the Internet is regulated. We need action and we are looking to you to do so, and this committee will be aggressively working to ensure that that action is taken.    Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, ma'am.    Mr. Culberson. Madam Secretary, we appreciate your service to the country. In conclusion, we will be following up and deeply appreciate your attention as we discuss making sure we are protecting American industry, making sure that we are keeping the Internet safe and secure against cyber attack.    And the Founding Fathers entrusted--one of the most powerful checks and balances we have in our Federal system is the power of the purse, and over the decades Congress entrusted that authority to the Appropriations Committee and it was in turn entrusted to the subcommittee chairman. And as the new chairman of the subcommittee, the new rule is, for every agency under our jurisdiction, if you want access to our hard-earned tax dollars, follow Federal law as enacted by Congress and that will be true of all the agencies as well as the grant recipients. That is why I will be paying particular attention to sanctuary cities, for example. If they want access to our hard-earned tax dollars, they are going to have to follow Federal law.    We will work hard with you to make sure that we give you the resources you need to fulfill the mission that you have, but we really want you to be aggressive in protecting American industry and protecting the privacy and security of Americans in this digital age as Mr. Carter just pointed out because the Chinese are engaged in cyber warfare against the United States. They have stolen virtually every piece of intellectual property in this country and it's just unacceptable and it has just got to stop.    And we will work with you to make sure you've got the resources you need, but we will also be exercising aggressive and good stewardship and working with you in a cooperative way using the power of the purse entrusted to the Congress by the founders. And we deeply appreciate your service to the country and thank you very much for appearing to us today and the hearing is adjourned.                                           Thursday, March 3, 2016.    Mr. Culberson. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science will come to order. I would like to welcome our two distinguished panelists, Dr. Charles Elachi, the Director of Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and Dr. Jonathan Lunine, the Director of the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science. We are very pleased to have you here with us today to talk about the future of one of the most exciting areas of looking into the future of space exploration, the Ocean Worlds program that this committee put in place in last year's bill to open up new frontiers in the search for life where it will be the most, I think, promising. And we are going to discuss that with you today and I appreciate so much your taking the time to be with us.    I understand Dr. Elachi, we want to keep your testimony to a minimum, because we do not want you to get complete laryngitis. Dr. Elachi is being honored tonight. We want to make sure he has got enough voice for your acceptance speech tonight.    We live in an extraordinary time where the scientific community has revealed to the world that there are as many Earth-like planets as there are stars in the sky. The amazing discoveries that Kepler has made to discover not only Earth-like planets but solar systems everywhere we look and the possibility for life on those other worlds and indeed within our own solar system has become very, very real. So today we are here to talk about that search for life beyond Earth, the search for Earth-like planets, the need to develop next generation rocket propulsion to enable us to reach the outer solar system more rapidly and lay the foundation for interstellar travel so that our children and grandchildren will actually have the reality of being able to reach Alpha Centauri and beyond.    I particularly want to welcome our first witness, Dr. Charles Elachi, the Director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who it has been my privilege to know and work with ever since we first met in 2004 at the Mars Opportunity landing in January of that year. Over the years, as I have gotten to know Dr. Elachi and work with him, I have come to see that I think quite frankly that the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is the gold standard for NASA flight centers. The work that you do is extraordinary. The way that Cal Tech and JPL work with NASA is I think a model that I would like to see replicated at other flight centers around the country. Your collaboration with the National Science Foundation and MIT has most recently led to a confirmation of a theory that Albert Einstein came up with a hundred years ago about gravitational waves, something I am looking forward to getting briefed on when I come visit you again in the near future.    The discoveries you have made are just absolutely extraordinary. JPL in particular, NASA has developed with JPL taking the lead and creating mankind's first interplanetary data relay system with the constellation of satellites and landers that you have in place around Mars. And it is just absolutely extraordinary. The Opportunity lander, in fact, that I was there with you in January of 2004, is still thriving and doing well after all these years making great discoveries.    I want to make sure the committee is aware, Dr. Elachi has just announced his retirement. Your successor will be in the same position, I think, that Thomas Jefferson was when he discovered that Benjamin Franklin was retiring as the American Minister to France. Someone asked Mr. Jefferson about replacing Dr. Franklin, and he said, ``No one can replace Dr. Franklin. I can only succeed him.'' And your successor will be in the same position, Dr. Elachi. Your contributions to the country, to the exploration of outer space, and to pushing the frontiers of human knowledge are just absolutely unparalleled and it has been a great privilege for me to get to know you and work with you, and the great team that you have got there at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. And your successor is also going to have to manage, as you do so beautifully, to pull off not only weaving together all of the scientists, the engineers, but being able to work with elected leadership. And you know you will have the support of this committee. And your successor will have the same level of support that you have always had.    I want to be sure also to welcome and thank Dr. Lunine for being with us today, who is the David C. Duncan Professor in the Physical Sciences and the Director of Cornell's Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science. And you have a particular interest, I know Dr. Lunine, in how planets form and evolve, what processes maintain and make habitability possible, and what kind of exotic environments might host the chemistry that would be consistent with the evolution of life in one, maybe in the form that we know and perhaps in others. I would be interested to hear your thoughts on that.    We have in our bill, the 2016 appropriations bill and in previous bills, made certain by law that NASA is going to fund and fly the mission to Europa that the planetary decadal survey recommended last decade as a top priority, and then this decade as a priority right there with the Mars cache mission. And we have made that mission a top priority because it is the top priority of the decadal survey but also because it holds the greatest promise for discovering life on another world. And I want to discuss that and how important that mission is and why that moon of Jupiter is the place we will most likely, in your opinion, find life on another world in our own backyard.    NASA is uniquely positioned to explore our universe. It is the only government agency that pushes the boundaries of our knowledge by sending humans and machines beyond Earth to explore and discover. NASA's image among the American people is so positive and so high that the only other function of the government that even comes close to them is the United States Marine Corps in a wonderful nationwide survey that I saw, of when you think about the government which agency of the government has the greatest recognition and positive feeling. It is NASA and the United States Marine Corps.    But unfortunately once again the Office of Management and Budget has given us a 2017 request that cuts the planetary science budget; that cuts NASA below the level funded by this committee and the Senate. Very disappointing and aggravating. It is why we included language in the financial services portion of the bill that makes it clear that the agencies of the Federal government have to follow the appropriations bill and they cannot follow the budget. So it is important for you to communicate to your colleagues that they should just frankly ignore the budget recommendation. Do not be concerned, do not be alarmed by what they read in the budget. Follow what is in the appropriations bill. My good friend Mr. Honda and Mr. Fattah and the members of this subcommittee are going to make sure that we take good care of the scientific community and     The decadal survey in my mind has always been the gold standard that NASA should follow. They do a superb job of prioritizing missions, having the scientific community experts get together, and decide which missions are the most important and then they prioritize them. And if I could just take a moment before I wrap up and recognize my good friend and ranking member Mr. Honda, the decadal survey for 2013-22 states in relevant part that, ``if NASA's planetary budget is augmented then the program will also carry out the first in depth exploration of Jupiter's icy moon, Europa. This moon with its probable vast subsurface ocean sandwiched between a potentially active silicate interior and a highly dynamic surface ice shell, offers one of the most promising extraterrestrial habitable environments in the solar system and a plausible model for habitable environments outside of it. The Jupiter system in which Europa resides hosts an astonishing diversity of phenomenon, illuminating fundamental planetary processes. While Voyager and Galileo taught us much about Europa and the Jupiter system, the relatively primitive instrumentation of these missions and the low volume of data returned left many questions unanswered.''    The decadal survey goes on to say, ``Major discoveries surely remain to be made. The first step in understanding the potential of the outer solar system as an abode for life is a Europa mission with the goal of confirming the presence of an interior ocean, characterizing the satellite's ice shell, and enabling understanding of its geologic history.'' My colleagues, Ocean Worlds, and in particular Jupiter's moon Europa, hold many extraordinary discoveries that are yet to be made. We now know of course about the ocean of Enceladus, and we want to be sure we hear a little bit about that as well.    But in particular I would like the witnesses to focus on the importance of the Europa mission and why it is so critical that we go to Europa, and what we are likely to discover there, and what type of launch vehicle we want to use.    But before we proceed I would like to recognize my good friend Mr. Honda for any remarks that he would like to make.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Honda. I feel the same way, as I know Mr. Fattah does. And all of us on the subcommittee are extraordinarily supportive of the work that you do. Dr. Elachi, Dr. Lunine, we are glad to have you with us today. And we will start with you, Dr. Elachi. And of course, without objection, your written statement will be entered into the record in its entirety and we encourage you to summarize, particularly in light of the fact that we do not want you to lose your voice entirely. But thank you so much for being here, and Dr. Elachi, you are recognized.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Dr. Elachi. Dr. Lunine.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Dr. Lunine and Dr. Elachi. And I know my colleagues have questions. It is extraordinary, is it not? We have, the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats alike, strongly supported NASA and its mission. One of the most gratifying things we get to do, is to help you seek out new life and discover these incredible new worlds. And I have, in our bill this year we funded, NASA has the largest appropriation they have ever received since the start of the agency in 1958 and we have got planetary science funded at a level of $1.63 billion this year. What level of funding in your opinion, Dr. Elachi, will be necessary in the 2017 bill to make sure that we stay on track? That the planetary science community has the resources they need to achieve the objectives of the decadal survey, both for this flagship mission to Europa and the new frontiers and Discovery class missions?    Mr. Culberson. But we are on the right track? This funding level that we are on now, you have got what you need so far?    Mr. Culberson. You know when Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon, that is an extraordinarily important and important milestone. But the discovery of life on another world I think will be another one of those transformational moments in human history that when that occurs will encourage the entire, it will galvanize the country and the world and certainly encourage the nation to take NASA even further, funding levels that you will need to make sure the American space program is the best in the world. And that is actually another reason I have been so enthusiastic about this mission is that it holds the greatest promise for that first discovery of life on another world which will then enable the entire country to get behind NASA with the funding levels that you need to do what is necessary to keep the American space program the best in the world.    But for this mission to succeed, Dr. Elachi, I wanted to ask you about the launch vehicle. Talk to us, if you could, about the importance of using SLS for the Europa mission. And, can you talk to us a little bit about whether or not it will require one or two SLS missions? For example, one for the orbiter and one for the lander. Can you talk just a little bit about it?    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. They are going to call votes between about 11:20, I understand, and 11:30, so I want to move on to my--oh, excuse me, 11:30 and 11:50. So we do have a little more time. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Fattah.    Mr. Culberson. We have got two votes. And Mr. Honda would like to come back. I would like to come back. So if we could recess briefly, we will take these votes and then we will come back and have a few more questions. So the committee will stand in recess briefly. Thank you.    Mr. Culberson. All right. Thank you, Mr. Honda.    The hearing will come back to order. We have finished up our votes and I appreciate very much your patience with us taking a brief recess while we finished up on the House floor.    I wonder if I could to ask Dr. Elachi in particular. Of course, as you know, the fiscal year 2016 Appropriations Act directed NASA to launch a mission to Europa with a lander in order to confirm the presence of organics. If I could ask both of you, first of all, how essential is that we land on the surface in order to confirm the presence of organics?    Mr. Culberson. On the surface?    Mr. Culberson. Dr. Lunine.    Mr. Culberson. So you would agree, the only way to be certain is to land on the surface and actually test the ice deposits on the surface, that is the only way to be sure?    Mr. Culberson. Of course.    Mr. Culberson. And that is why, of course, as our bill states, the goal of this mission is to achieve the scientific objectives of the Decadal Survey, which as you have just confirmed for the record has to include a lander if we are going to answer that essential and most exciting question of all, is there life on other worlds.    And if I could, Dr. Elachi, ask about when does NASA intend to solicit instruments for the landers with an announcement of opportunity in fiscal year 2016?    Mr. Culberson. Well, we will push NASA to make sure they get this done as rapidly as possible. And I also hope that we will see at least two ways to verify the organics with the mass spectrometer and the Raman on the same lander. Because if we are going to go all this way and make this exciting mission, make sure that we actually are detecting organics, it makes sense to double check it, doesn't it?    Mr. Culberson. And the payload will be comparable to that which landed on Spirit and Opportunity on Mars in terms of the weight and size?    Mr. Culberson. Yes.    Mr. Culberson. Yes.    Mr. Culberson. I will have a couple followups. I want to recognize my good friend, Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Chirality?    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. You would have to make that measurement on the surface on the spot in order to be able to determine the left or right-handedness?    Mr. Culberson. Right. And, I also understand from the briefings that I have been given that the speed of fly-by is so high that any organic material that might be in that plume would be disintegrated by it. So another reason to land on the surface is the organics in that plume when you fly through it would probably disintegrate, as I recall this morning----    Mr. Culberson. No, the plume is created naturally. It is like Enceladus, the ocean is venting through cracks in the ice into the lower pressure, because it is essentially a vacuum. And we have seen it in Enceladus, detected a plume on Europa once or twice from Hubble.    Mr. Culberson. And the pyramid you are discussing, it would land similar to Spirit and Opportunity, there would be airbags around the pyramid?    Mr. Culberson. Could you talk a little bit about what we know about the ice? The surface is, it is a free-floating ice shell, not sure how thick, but the age.    Mr. Culberson. And if the surface is that young, it obviously implies that it is being continually replenished and that that ice is diving down into the ocean and coming back up. And because of the intense radiation, I think I have read that the hydrogen atoms are being stripped away from the H<INF>2</INF>O, which means it is oxygen-enriched ice going down into the ocean and releasing that oxygen, so it is plausible that that ocean has been oxygenated for billions of years?    Mr. Culberson. I also understand from talking to Dr. Robert Ballard that these mid-ocean ridges, which are not visible here, the largest volcanic system on the Earth, the 40,000-mile long mid-ocean ridge, that Dr. Ballard told us that for years geologists couldn't figure out the chemistry of the Earth's ocean, they didn't understand why it had the mixture of chemicals that it did, that the rivers flowing into the ocean, you couldn't account for the chemistry of the ocean just based on rivers until they discovered these mid-ocean ridges. And Dr. Ballard points out that the entire volume of Earth's oceans circulate through those mid-ocean ridges every few million years, he thinks maybe 4 to 6 million years, and that injects a tremendous amount of chemicals into the earth's oceans, which account, once they did that calculation, it matched perfectly and it explained why the Earth's oceans have the level of salt and other chemical elements within it.    And clearly wouldn't you say that is a reasonable analogy to what we see in Europa where the silicate, you are detecting silica in the plumes on Enceladus, almost certainly, you have got a rocky bottom to the oceans of Europa, so is it reasonable to assume that you have got similar circulation of the salt water on Europa going through those volcanic black smokers, we will probably have black smokers on the bottom of the oceans of Europa as we see on earth?    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Just to wrap up on Europa, I want to make sure I understand that you have got an oxygenated ocean, this obvious evidence of a lot of heat, probably circulation through those volcanic ridges, and the ice would also protect that ocean from asteroid impact and radiation, so a very stable and secure environment for potentially life to not only begin, but to then be sheltered for essentially the life of the moon; is that accurate?    Mr. Culberson. And I want to stress too, of course, for the record that this is obviously a keen interest of the committee, of mine, but it is the top priority of the Decadal Survey. This is something that we are pursuing, Mr. Honda, and the subcommittee is supporting, because this is the consensus of the scientific community in the Decadal Survey, correct, that we need to go to Europa?    Mr. Culberson. And I want to also, if I could, because the other purpose of this hearing today and we will wrap up here in a few minutes, but I want to lay the foundation for the future. The idea of this hearing was to talk about the exploration of these ocean worlds as a great opportunity to discover life perhaps in our own backyard.    Talk to us about, if you could, as you mentioned, the oceans of Enceladus, that is a free-floating ice shell as well?    Mr. Culberson. And the water--go ahead. Sorry, Dr. Elachi.    Mr. Culberson. Right. And those of course would also be prime candidates for launch on the SLS? They are smaller spacecraft, but again to get there rapidly, you would need the     Mr. Culberson. How deep is the ocean on Titan, do you think, or is it a sea?    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Honda, dive in any time.    Mr. Culberson. If I could also to follow up, because I want to talk a little bit about it before we wrap up, the purpose of this hearing today is to talk about the next step and it is developing a program like we had with the Mars mission. We have discovered these oceans that exist in the outer solar system, they are undoubtedly, probably very common throughout the universe, and it is important that if we are going to discover life, it is going to be in those oceans.    Talk first for a moment about, for example, what other moons in the outer solar system do you think could have oceans of water?    Mr. Culberson. Any of the moons of Uranus indicate any evidence of----    Mr. Culberson. So the ocean moon exploration program that we have outlined in our bill will be obviously focused initially, the first mission to Europa, Enceladus and Titan would be the most immediate and obvious targets.    And what we learned from the New Horizons mission to Pluto, large amounts of water in evidence there on Pluto too, isn't it? Frozen obviously, but you found water on Pluto and that was unexpected.    Mr. Culberson. The point I wanted to drive at is that everywhere we look too out there, there is a lot of water.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. If I could, having the benefit of your presence here, Dr. Elachi and Dr. Lunine, talk about the far future, because one of the exciting things about this Ocean Worlds Exploration Program is it will be laying the foundation to develop the next generation of rocket propulsion and to take NASA on to the next level, because when we do discover life in another world, I think that will encourage the public to support the level of funding NASA is going to need.    Let me ask first quickly about the work that NASA is doing with the Department of Energy to support radio isotope power systems, is the level of funding that we have in this year's bill sufficient, and are you satisfied with the work that is being done to increase the power output and to reduce the mass and size?    Mr. Culberson. That would be the second mission to Europa would be to get through the ice, this mission will involve some artificial intelligence because of the distances involved. The computers on board will have to make a lot of decisions on their own as they are approaching the surface; is that correct?    Mr. Culberson. And that second mission would require a heat source sufficient for a submersible vehicle to melt through the ice, drop out into that ocean, and then transmit images and information back to the surface to tell us what is beneath that ice and we hope reach the bottom of that ocean.    Mr. Culberson. The ice, rather, yes.    Mr. Culberson. Let me wrap up with, talk about WFIRST and looking out beyond our solar system to identify earth-like planets around nearby stars and the chronograph that you are developing in the Starshade, because it is extraordinarily exciting and looking out into the future, the WFIRST is essentially a flagship mission in terms of investment, that would be second, then we do the Europa mission, and then the next big mission would probably be WFIRST.    Could you tell Mr. Honda and I a little bit about the WFIRST mission and its importance, coupled with Starshade, in identifying and then spectrally analyzing the atmosphere of earth-like planets around a nearby star?    Mr. Culberson. But you would be able to with WFIRST, the chronograph that you already are developing, to be able to directly image or be able to pick up the light of these exoplanets and spectrographically analyze their atmospheres, they could detect--and please for the record, I just want to confirm, the smoking gun for life would be methane, oxygen together?    Mr. Culberson. Could WFIRST do that for us, Dr. Elachi, to determine----    Mr. Culberson. We are about to wrap up, but I want to make sure, I have this great opportunity, these two brilliant scientists here with us today and with Dr. Elachi's imminent retirement, I want to make sure I have got a chance to get this on the record, that one of the goals of WFIRST is to not only be able to directly image those exoplanets, but it would have the ability from the briefing that I got at JPL, particularly with Starshade because you don't lose any photons with Starshade, to be able to spectrographically analyze that light from that earth-like planet, it was my understanding from the scientists that briefed me at JPL that they would be able to see the spectrographic signature of methane and oxygen, they would be able to see it.    Mr. Culberson. And perhaps even industrial pollution, we will be able to see perhaps hydro fluorocarbons.    But nevertheless, that then leads to our kids and grandkids, and I hope one of the legacies that I would like to leave as the subcommittee chairman of this marvelous committee and with your help, Mr. Honda, that not only have we then discovered life in another world, we hope in Europa, identified earth-like planets and picked up the spectrographic signature of an atmosphere that contains methane and oxygen. But I hope also finally, in conclusion, to ask about the development of the next generation of rocket propulsion ion engines that would be able to take a spacecraft to Alpha Centauri, which is about four and a half light years away, and if we could achieve what percent of the speed of light do you think is possible, two percent, four percent, five percent perhaps?    Mr. Culberson. I think Mr. Honda has a question.    Mr. Culberson. And then just in conclusion, that is really the final piece of this hearing----    Mr. Culberson . Was to really, I hope, as a result of the time that I have got, if I have the privilege to stay here as the chairman for that time period, we will have laid the foundation not only to discover life in that other world, but to have identified those earth-like planets around other solar systems, and then develop the rocket technology so that our children and grandchildren will have the opportunity to be witness to the first interstellar missions to Alpha Centauri. It may take 80 years or a hundred years to get there, but perhaps today we have heard for the first time how we here can lay the foundation stones for that to happen.    I want to thank you very, very much for your service to the country----    Dr. Culberson . And for the time that you have given us here today. And in particular, Dr. Elachi, thank you for the extraordinary work that you have done for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, for the nation, for NASA. The incredible discoveries that have been made on your watch I don't think would have been possible but for your leadership. You have woven together the extraordinary talent of the scientists and engineers at JPL, but also have been able to bring together the political support that was so essential to make sure that these magnificent missions were successful. And we will continue to give you all the support that we can at JPL and NASA in general.    And, Dr. Lunine, I want to thank you for being here as well.                                           Tuesday, March 15, 2016.                       Chairman's Opening Remarks    Mr.  Culberson. The Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee will come to order. I want to welcome our witness, General Bolden, and thank you for your service to the country, General Bolden. For your service to NASA, to the space program, and for keeping us all safe and free and strong for your service in the United States Marine Corps as well. And this has just occurred to me, today may be your last hearing here in front of us. I want to thank you very much again for your service. And what a privilege it has been for us to work with you, to help make sure the American space program is the best in the world, has been, always will be.    This committee and the Congress has been committed to the American space program. We and the Congress and the country have given the space program all the support that you need. We have often given you too much on your plate and not enough money to do so. But in this year's 2016 appropriations bill, as you know, we made certain that you for the first time have got the resources you need to do what is on your plate to ensure that we never surrender the high ground of outer space to any other nation. And we will continue to do so. The Congress and the country strongly support what you and your colleagues at NASA are doing, General Bolden.    We today in our hearing are going to discuss the 2017 appropriations bill and what NASA's needs are for 2017. I am actually going to minimize any discussion, frankly General Bolden, of the President's fiscal year 2017 budget request because quite frankly it is, I have to say that President Obama's budget request is frankly almost embarrassing. We cannot and will not even consider a budget request that would ask this Congress to cut NASA's funding. We cannot consider a budget request that contains $763 million in unauthorized mandatory fees and taxes and things that just are not going to happen.    We, all of us in this committee, admire you and the great men and women at NASA immensely. We will certainly talk about the President's budget request but it is not realistic. It is not going to happen. And I cannot imagine anyone in this Congress seriously considering it. And I am actually glad we have got language in the 2016 appropriations bill and the 2015 bill and we will have it again in this bill that says no agency of the Federal government can change any funding level for any policy or program based on the President's budget request. That the agencies have to follow the appropriations bill, because that is what matters, it is the will of Congress as signed into law by the President. And we know that, and you cannot really comment on this, but I know you are as disappointed as we are in the President's request. We love what you do at NASA and we are going to be here to support you, sir. And we will make certain that we are going to do our very best in this tough budget environment to be sure that NASA has got the resources that you need to do your job. Because, you know, the bottom line is this request that we have received from the White House is essentially a $1.023 billion cut to NASA's budget which is just not going to happen. We are not going to let that happen.    We have in this budget year in the--you know, it really is baffling. It is hard for me to find the words to describe it. And it is not your fault, General Bolden. You do a superb job. The men and women at NASA do a great job. But it is very difficult for us to get our arms around the fact that the White House would actually expect the Congress to cut NASA by over $1 billion and has not given us, not given you the support that you need, sir.    Also I think it is important to note that NASA has just accepted a new group of applications for just 14 spots in your 2017 class of astronauts, an indication of the level of support the country has for the work that you do. They had over 18,300 applications for 14 spots as astronauts. That is a record that surpasses the previous 1978 record of 8,000 applications. And it is an indication, I think, of the level of support the country has for the work that you do. Every time there is a new space mission, a new landing, a new launch, the NASA website becomes one of the most popular in the country. There is just a tremendous amount of support out there for what you do. And it just continues to be baffling to us as to why the Office of Management and Budget refuses to give you the support that we think you deserve.    But this subcommittee will make sure that you get the resources that you need. Again, this is going to be a tough budget year and we will be right there behind you, sir, every step of the way. And before we proceed I would like to recognize Mr. Honda for any remarks he would like to make.                     Ranking Member Opening Remarks    Mr. Culberson. Fourteen spots.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Honda. General Bolden, we really do appreciate your service. Thank you for being here today. And without objection, your written statement will be entered into the record in its entirety. And we welcome your summary of your testimony. If you can do so within approximately five minutes or so it would be great.                    Administrator's Opening Remarks    General Bolden. Yes, sir. I will do my best. And Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, it is my extreme pleasure and it is actually an honor for me to be here today to discuss with you President Obama's $19 billion fiscal year 2017 budget request for NASA. And I, it is unusual for me to do this. But because there are young students here, I want them to go back understanding how this process works. And I think you mischaracterize me when you say that I am disappointed in the President's budget. I am not. I helped to craft it. And I am very proud of that budget. And we will discuss in this hearing how we got there and then the process that you all are going to use to give us the funds that we finally get in appropriations. Because what they should take away is that the President proposes, which means it is a proposal, and the Congress disposes, which means you all give us the money. And as you said, that is what becomes the budget. So I did not want them to go away thinking that the NASA Administrator was not happy with the President's budget, because I am. We worked really hard to bring you that budget. So now I have wasted a lot of my time.    This request builds on the outstanding fiscal year 2016 NASA appropriation that this Congress gave us last year. And I mean it when I say it was an outstanding budget. $19.3 billion is not chump change. And we really want to be able to extend what that budget allows us to do, and that was the way we crafted the 2017 budget. I want to thank you again, Mr. Chairman, personally for your leadership in crafting the 2016 budget.    So it is my honor to serve as the NASA Administrator throughout the Obama administration. And as we submit what is likely, as you mentioned, my final budget, I am also proud of the many things this agency has accomplished on behalf of the American people with the resources the President and Congress have committed to us over the past seven years. Together we have enabled our nation to continue leading the world in space exploration and scientific discovery.    Two weeks ago American astronaut Scott Kelly returned home from the International Space Station after 12 months working off the Earth for the Earth. His year in space will pay scientific and medical dividends for years to come, helping pave the way for future astronauts to travel to Mars and beyond. Commander Kelly significantly advanced our journey to Mars and I trust that you join me in saluting his service to our nation.    NASA is closer to sending American astronauts to Mars than at any point in human history and this budget will keep us moving forward. The support of this committee and Congress is essential to this journey. The International Space Station is the cornerstone of our exploration strategy. Thanks to the determination and ingenuity of American industry, we have returned Space Station cargo resupply launches to U.S. soil, insourced jobs, and helped establish a new private market in low Earth orbit. American companies are now ferrying supplies to our astronauts on the Space Station from the United States with Orbital ATK set to launch again later this month, in fact next week, and SpaceX targeting a resupply mission in early April, both from the Kennedy Space Center.    In July Orbital will conduct a return to flight mission from the Wallops Flight Facility. Thanks to the administration's decision to invest in American industry and to this committee's full funding in last year's budget, Boeing and SpaceX continue to make great progress toward certification in 2017 to safely transport our astronauts to the Space Station from U.S. soil, ending our sole reliance on Russia once and for all.    NASA is making significant progress on the journey to Mars, developing our newest, most powerful rocket ever built, the Space Launch System, and the Orion Crew Vehicle as part of a sustainable and affordable deep space exploration system. This budget supports the Agency's baseline commitment for an uncrewed test flight of SLS and Orion in 2018 and a crewed flight by 2023. With additional funding provided by Congress, the teams are working toward an earlier launch date for the first crewed mission and are already designing and procuring long lead hardware for subsequent missions.    The budget also increases funding for habitation systems development, a key component of our stepping stone strategy to send humans to Mars.    The President's budget funds a robust science program with dozens of operating missions studying our solar system, the universe, and the most important planet in our solar system, Earth. This coming July 4th, Independence Day, the Juno spacecraft will orbit Jupiter while the Cassini spacecraft will prepare to execute its dramatic grand finale orbits of Saturn. OSIRIS-REx will launch to a near-Earth asteroid to collect samples for return to Earth in 2023. In 2017 and 2018 NASA will launch seven exciting space science missions, including the James Webb Space Telescope. Before we send humans to Mars robots are paving the way, with Mars InSight now targeted for launch in 2018. Another Mars rover set to launch in 2020, joining the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers now exploring the red planet, and work underway to define the next Mars mission for 2022.    We are formulating missions to explore Jupiter's moon Europa, as well as WFIRST, designed to study dark energy, perform galactic and extragalactic surveys, and explore exoplanets.    We are accelerating the building of LANDSAT 9 as part of our sustainable land imaging architecture to continue our over 40-year record of high quality measurement of Earth's land cover.    NASA technology drives exploration. With this request, NASA will continue to conduct rapid development and incorporation of transformative space technologies to enable future human and robotic missions, increase capabilities of other U.S. agencies, and address aerospace industry challenges. Space technology investments will ensure that we continue to lead the world in exploration and scientific discovery.    NASA's aeronautics program advances U.S. global leadership by developing and transferring key enabling technologies to make aviation safer, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly. With this request, NASA aeronautics is ready to take the next step to develop and fly X-plane demonstrators in partnership with industry and academia, including ultra-efficient subsonic transport experimental aircraft and the world's first low boom supersonic flight demonstrator.    Mr. Chairman, we appreciate the strong and consistent support we have received from this committee. I look forward to your questions.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, General Bolden. We appreciate the fact that the budget does indeed include an Outer Planets and Ocean Worlds exploration program. That is something that these young people in the audience and around the country are going to become increasingly excited about as they discover that there are indeed water worlds out there that have probably some of the best potential for us finding life on another world. And I am very pleased to see that the budget request does acknowledge that. We in the Congress included in the 2016 bill, created an Ocean Worlds program for that reason and have focused on the Europa mission in particular as the first one to fly because of the recommendations of the decadal survey of planetary sciences.    For the young people in the audience and anyone listening, every ten years, General, the scientific community gets together at the National Academies and develop a 10-year plan looking forward to decide what are the most important missions that should be flown in heliophysics and studying the sun, or studying the Earth, and studying the planets, and then looking out beyond our own solar system. And that decadal survey is a good road map for the next 10 years. And in our 2016 bill I made sure we included in our 2016 bill guidance to NASA to look to those decadal surveys in each one of those areas as kind of a blueprint of where NASA should go over the next decade. And that blueprint for the planetary scientists listed the Mars mission 2020 as No. 1, to cache samples from the surface and retrieve them later. That mission has been funded and is going to be done. And their number two priority this decade, and their top priority last decade, was the mission to Europa. Because that moon contains at least two to three times more salt water than there is on Earth, it has all the basic ingredients for life to be present. And so we are very supportive of the work that NASA is doing to send an orbiter and a lander to Europa to find out whether or not there are organic molecules in that ocean. And could you comment, General, on your feelings about the decadal survey recommendation? Do you agree with the decadal survey recommendation that the Europa mission is important?    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman I am, having talked to Steve Squyres who chaired the latest planetary decadal, I agree with the priorities that they set. And one of the things that I was most impressed with was the fact that he really looked hard at cost. And so, you know, I think that they are projects that can be done. And that is why we have sent Mars 2020 and a sample return as number one in compliance with the decadal survey and we are now trying to formulate the mission to Europa. And I assume we will talk a little bit more about that as the hearing goes on.    Mr. Culberson. Sure. You know, the Congress gives you direction.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. That is actually the one mission it is illegal for NASA not to fly, is the Europa mission, because it is so important that we find out whether or not we are alone in the universe, and then it will also help I think galvanize the public. One of the reasons I have been so interested in this mission is not only has it been, in the decadal survey it was the top priority last decade and the last NASA administrator, your predecessors neglected it. It was cast by the wayside. And this time we want to make sure it is done. So it is a directive from the Congress to make sure this mission is flown and we made sure you have got the resources to do it. And right now I know that design work is going forward on the lander, correct? And----    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, we have a total effort going on on the Europa mission entirely, which is orbiter and lander. I think you and I have discussed this before. My strong recommendation to the committee and my strong recommendation to the community would be that we separate an orbiter from a lander in order to optimize our chances of being successful with both. When we look at the Mars program as a model, before we landed, we actually landed Mariner 4 in 1965 and it was 11 years later when we put Viking 1 and 2 on the surface of Mars. And that was for a very good reason, the fact that we just did not know the Martian surface and we wanted to make sure that we understood it fully. We are in the same situation with Europa. We want to make sure that we characterize the surface of the moon prior to deciding on a place that we are going to put a lander. We are definitely working on a lander. But, you know, my strong recommendation would be that we separate a lander from an orbiter in the mission. But that remains to be done. We expect that we will be at preliminary design review in 2018. And at that time it will say whether or not we have a lander and an orbiter together, it will say what kind of launch vehicle we use, and the like. So we are responding to the direction from the Congress.    Mr. Culberson. Good. Thank you, sir. And I understand what you are saying and appreciate the fact that your scientists are looking at, engineers, right now whether to launch the lander separately and, you know, the orbiter would obviously go first. And I understand what you are saying. The discussions are ongoing right now----    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson . About whether or not you want to put the lander on the same rocket or launch it separately. It may indeed be, I think you are probably right, it may be a good idea to launch them on two separate SLS rockets so that the orbiter goes first in order to scout the surface, as Mariner 4 did. Mariner 4 was of course a fly by, and then they did orbiters, and then landed second. So that is the direction the Europa mission is taking. I think that is a very good idea. And as always, your folks at the flight centers do a terrific job.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. I am particularly impressed with the work that the flight centers, for example, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a Federally funded research and development center and Johns Hopkins University has a similar arrangement with----    General Bolden. APL, Applied Physics Laboratory.    Mr. Culberson . APL, Applied Physics Lab.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. And they do a superb job. And you have the universities that are essentially running the flight center and they are in a five-year contract, I think, with NASA and they are reviewed every five years. I am keenly interested in trying to find a way to replicate that model for some of the other flight centers to get the young people involved, the university communities, scientists, engineers, graduate students involved in helping these NASA flight centers. From your perspective I really would love to have your thoughts, General----    General Bolden. You are going to get me in trouble, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Culberson . How would, it is difficult with the human space flight program. I think that is very different. That is a real challenge. But when it comes to, for example, Ames in Mr. Honda's district, with all those great universities right there, Stanford and others right here, the Glenn Flight Center in Ohio, could you give us your thoughts on how we could think about looking into the future transitioning perhaps Ames, and to let maybe have Stanford and some of the other great universities in the area bid on adopting Ames, taking over Ames, and running it like a Federally funded research and development center like JPL, like Cal Tech does JPL. How can we replicate that model at some of the other flight centers and what are your thoughts on that?    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, I, you know, the National Academies have done studies on this in the past. We have actually done studies and based on the information that I have, mainly to include information yesterday from my deputy who served on National Academy boards that looked at this, I would not recommend that NASA go the model of, you know, of more than one FFRDC. The examples you gave, Ames does an incredible job right now of engaging the students, both undergraduate, graduate, and post-grad on the campus of Stanford and other neighboring universities. Right now if you go out to the Ames Astrobiology Center you will be introduced to something called the biobrick. And that is the result of collaboration between students at Stanford University and people at the Ames Astrobiology Center. And that is what we are going to use when we go to the surface of Mars. So it is a study that probably needs to be done again. But based on my limited knowledge and what I have read from the Academies and others, I would be leery of trying to assign more than the FFRDC that we have right now for NASA.    Mr. Culberson. Why?    General Bolden. Well I have served on the advisory committee for Lawrence Livermore Lab. And one of the things that frustrated me was the fact that it did not get along with its sister labs. Each lab is an entity unto its own. They are run by a contractor. There is no single mission. I would really defer to the Secretary of Energy, because he lives and breathes with FFRDCs everyday. That is the bulk of his centers are that way. And I just found, you know, as the NASA administrator when I set a mission for the agency and I bring all the center directors together and say, okay look, I want to hear everybody's opinion, I want to hear all dissenting opinions, and after that I am going to make a decision. And we are going in that direction. The journey to Mars, for example. You could not do that with a bunch of FFRDCs. Because they operate independently. They do not have any single person like the NASA administrator who says you are going to do this. They are all set up for different things. That would be my, you know, my opinion, my humble opinion.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much. Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Jolly. General Bolden, just if I could very quickly, to be sure that you all are following, NASA is following the appropriations bill.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. OK.    General Bolden. We are, and that is what I meant, Mr. Chairman. We are working on the 2016 appropriation.    Mr. Culberson. You are working, exactly. That is very important. Because over the years that I have had the privilege to serve on this subcommittee, I got so frustrated with predecessors, the previous President, not just this President but previous Presidents, who did not give NASA the attention that you deserve, the support that you deserve. The President would come out with a budget and NASA and every other agency would just change direction and start following the budget request instead of the appropriations bill. And I got so frustrated with it. Because it is damaging to the exploration upper stage, to these incredibly expensive and complicated spacecraft and rocket programs for the agency, all these fine men and women who have devoted their lives to building these rockets and spacecraft, to change course and start following the President's budget.    This is a very important point I just want to drive home, is that the--I am pleased to hear you say you are following the appropriations bill. Because I put statutory language in last year's bill and this one that says literally no agency can change any program, policy, you cannot change funding levels for any program or policy based on the President's budget. You have to follow the appropriations bill. And you are following the appropriations bill?    General Bolden. We are following the 2016 appropriations presently, sir.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. So the budget recommendation for the President is simply a recommendation for our discussion. As long as you follow the appropriations bill, we are good.    Mr. Culberson. That is the law. Right. But it is so frustrating to see the agency change course----    Mr. Culberson . When we love you, we are devoted to you, and we want you to stay the course and follow the 2016 appropriations bill. Thank you. Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Palazzo.    Mr. Culberson. General Bolden, real quickly, when you mention international partners, what countries are you thinking about, present and future international partners?    General Bolden. We have about 15 partners on the International Space Station today. If you are talking about aeronautics we have 26 partners in something called the International Federation of Aeronautics Research. And so there are a lot; we have more than 800 signed agreements today with more than 120 nations in the world. So NASA is the world leader when it comes to aeronautics, science, and exploration.    Mr. Culberson. I just want to be sure we are not talking about the Chinese.    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, whenever we do anything with the Chinese, as I think you and the committee are aware, we submit a certification to you and to the Senate Appropriations Committee listing every individual that is going to be in the meeting, what the subject is going to be. We go through an enormous database----    Mr. Culberson. Right, and we clear that with the FBI.    General Bolden. We clear----    Mr. Culberson. We want to keep that contact very, very limited.    General Bolden. I just did not want to mislead anyone that----    Mr. Culberson. Because they are not our friend.    General Bolden . Yes, sir, that we do not do anything with the Chinese. When we do, though, we certify as required by law that the folks that we are working with are not engaged in human rights violations, are not engaged in terrorism, and there is going to be no exchange of technology.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much.    General Bolden. And we have lived by that.    Mr. Culberson. Ms. Roby.    Mr. Culberson. To follow-up on Ms. Roby's question, she is correct; we are, all of us, strong supporters of getting the SLS Program up and running as quickly as possible, but you said you are doing a run out? Your estimates on when you could launch are based on the President's budget?    General Bolden. We look at----    Mr. Culberson. You really cannot use that; that is just simply a recommendation. What matters is the appropriations.    General Bolden. You are absolutely right. The spending this year is determined by the appropriations we get. You know, in my world, then I have to pick and choose some amount of funding, and so I pick what we assume the run out on our budget is going to be--it will get us to 2030; that is impossible to think that----    Mr. Culberson. Based on the President's recommendation?    General Bolden. Based on the President's out year budget, yes.    But we state--Mr. Chairman, we state that very clearly, that based on the President's budget request at our key decision point where we made our official announcement about the date for launch and the cost for the vehicle, that very clearly states that that is based on the President's budget request, not on a single year's appropriation. And we also, as I just said to Mr. Jolly and Mrs. Roby, if the Congress chooses to fund us at a higher level, that conceivably draws the launch date in, but not necessarily.    It depends on--because we are talking about a program, you know, and we want to purchase long lead items. We want to do     Mr. Culberson. Well, it is hard to be critical of this good man because he is a Marine and a good soldier.    General Bolden. No, Mr. Chairman. That is----    Mr. Culberson. No, but you are following the President--I understand you are--you know, you have to follow what the President's recommended, but I just want to make sure----    General Bolden. Yes.    Mr. Culberson. Ms. Roby's right; we are going to get you the funding that you need to make sure that SLS is taken care of. You can launch then on--you are expecting that you will be able to launch in 2018 for EM----    General Bolden. 2018 for EM-1 and 2023 for EM-2.    Mr. Chairman, you know, you have to understand when we put a lot of these budgets together, we were under sequester. We are still under sequester. That is not done yet. You know, it would be nice for me to pretend that the Congress has solved the sequester question. So, the President's 2017 budget is optimistic, if you compared that with what we would get under sequester. So, I am taking an optimistic view at being able to develop a program. We need to get our financial house in order. I agree with you.    Mr. Culberson. Sure. Talk to us a little bit about stability and certainty and predictability. What would be some of the things that, for example, the NASA authorization bill, that Mr. Palazzo mentioned from his work on the Science Committee. I have been keenly interested in this and Chairman Smith has been very supportive of legislation that my predecessor, Frank Wolf, and I developed to try to give NASA a greater certainty and predictability and stability in your out years----    General Bolden. Yes.    Mr. Culberson . So you could plan for the future.    What are some of the things--for example, multiyear procurement, I understand you already have the ability to do multiyear procurement. And what could the--what can you do and what can the Congress do to support you in that effort to give the agency greater stability from year to year, so you are not doing----    General Bolden. You really want my answer, sir?    Mr. Culberson. I do, thank you.    General Bolden. If the Congress were to do one single thing that would dramatically increase the stability that this agency and every other agency of the Federal government, it would be multiyear funding. You know, one-year budgets, they don't--they make life miserable for American industry, for our workers, for everybody. If the Congress--if the Authorization Committee wanted to do one thing, just one thing that would dramatically change the way that this country operates and competes, it would be one-year funding.    Mr. Culberson. And you, of course, already have the authority to do multiyear procurement, however, on the big rocket systems and spacecraft.    General Bolden. Well, you know, we get two-year money and we get that kind of money. That is not the same as multiyear funding, where instead of giving me a one-year budget, you give me a budget for five years.    Mr. Culberson. But I want to find out within the existing boundaries of law----    General  Bolden. Ms. Roby is smiling at me because she won't argue with the chairman.    Mr. Culberson . Until we have a new authorization.    Mr. Culberson. Sure.    Mr. Culberson. But I mean in terms of multiyear procurement. I am talking about greater stability for the future----    Mr. Culberson. Yes.    General Bolden. No. You asked me about authorizers.    Mr. Culberson. Sure. Sure. Yes. Yes.    General Bolden. Because, as I understand it, the way this thing works is, in a perfect world, the authorizers give you guidance. They give you a roadmap and then you fund it. That almost never works.    You know I have been a NASA administrator for six years. I think I have had two authorization bills, maybe three.    Mr. Culberson. Yes, it has been very frustrating, because the House, as Mr. Palazzo says, we do our part----    General Bolden. I share your frustration, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Culberson . But they disappear in the Senate.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. So that--but you would be able to, as you mentioned, do advanced procurement of critical components.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. If you already got that authority----    General Bolden. That would be incredible.    Mr. Culberson . If we gave you the funding necessary, for example, on SLS, as you said to Ms. Roby, you could do advancement procurement of critical core components. That is done in the Virginia-class nuclear submarine program, for example.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. The Navy will buy components of the nuclear reactors in advance----    General Bolden. Yes.    Mr. Culberson . In order to help make sure that they have got some stability over multiple years.    Let me ask very quickly, when, this year, will you-- before I pass it to Mr. Honda--to follow up, one last question on the Europa mission, when over the next few months will you be announcing an announcement of opportunity for the science instruments to be included on the lander for Europa?    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, that is--that won't happen this year. You know, we have to decide, first of all--I think I mentioned earlier that I--and I will--let me take it for the record, because I do not want to misspeak, because I know you have information from JPL and others and I do not want to get cross-wise with the guys that work for me.    Mr. Culberson. Take that for the record. Let's do that for the record.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. I recognize that, right?    Mr. Culberson. Well, no; that is the Johnson Space Center. Thank you. Thank you, Mike.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    Mr. Palazzo.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Palazzo is right, it is extraordinarily important to protecting the nation's space program and our technology from penetration by foreign agents, it is very important. And I know there was a problem at Ames, for example, and letting foreign nationals come into the facility.    So you mentioned, General Bolden, I heard you say Foreign National Access Management. I hope you have got procedures in place to essentially keep foreign nationals out of NASA Flight Centers and they don't get access to----    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, I cannot stand here and say that is true, that is not true. We have foreign nationals who operate on NASA facilities every day, we have foreign nationals who may actually be NASA employees like every other agency of the Federal Government.    Mr. Culberson. Well, in particular the Chinese.    General Bolden. So I understand what you----    Mr. Culberson. The Chinese are the ones we are most concerned about.    General Bolden. The Chinese, that is different, yes.    Mr. Culberson. So no Chinese foreign nationals are getting access to NASA Flight Centers or computers?    General Bolden. No foreign nationals are getting unauthorized access to any classified material, sensitive material. No, none, zero.    Mr. Culberson. OK, thank you.    General Bolden. But, Mr. Chairman, I want to be very clear, no unauthorized access. Any time anyone who is not an American, in fact even American citizens have to go through a very stringent process to be allowed to have access to classified and sensitive material. That program is much more robust for a foreign national.    So I just don't want to lead you to believe that we have put a wall up and only Americans are going into bases.    Mr. Culberson. But the ones we are most concerned about are the Chinese.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. Because the Chinese space program is owned lock, stock and barrel, controlled by the People's Liberation Army. It is a military program designed to help them better target their ICBMs at the United States and they have a long history of stealing our technology. And it is just unacceptable the level of cyber theft and espionage the Chinese have been engaged.    And our predecessor, Frank Wolf, very wisely and with a lot of foresight, included language in our bill which we have kept and strengthened, that in Section 531, General Bolden, governs NASA's bilateral activities with China.    And I wanted to ask, if you could, sir, to please explain the process that NASA uses to ensure compliance with Section 531, which in part states that NASA must certify that these bilateral activities, these meetings, pose no risk of technology transfer or other information with national security or economic security implications to China or to a Chinese-owned company. How does NASA ensure compliance?    General Bolden. Yes, sir, and I made reference to this a little bit earlier. In order to follow the law pursuant to Section 531, we actually use an independent third party tool to execute our foreign national investigations. The tool is called Visual Compliance and that allows us to look at, among other databases, but there are five FBI databases, there are several Department of Treasury databases, those from the Department of Commerce, Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, Arms Export Control Department lists, and on and on and on. And so that is the process that we use for every single person that I put on a certification letter to you.    And as a result of some additional direction that came in Section 531, I now also provide a copy of that certification letter to the Director of the FBI, it goes via email transmission to--it doesn't go to Director Comey personally, but it goes to his executive secretary and it goes to the Section Chief of the FBI headquarters Counterintelligence Division, who right now is Mr. Crouch.    And as I said, my intent some time after this hearing is to actually sit down or at least, maybe not sit down, but talk to Director Comey and make sure that this process that I just explained to you meets the requirements and the needs of the FBI, so that they can feel that what we are certifying is in fact accurate.    Mr. Culberson. Right, because the reason that new language was added was to be sure that you are not just telling the FBI, but that you are involving them. That we want you to be able to get back from them and for them to be able to tell you this looks like it is okay or that is not okay.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Culberson. Let me ask, if I could--well, let me go to Mr. Honda, I have gone over a little bit.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    Mr. Palazzo.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much.    Administrator Bolden, just a couple more followups.    On the commercial crew program, I wanted to ask if any of the fiscal year 2016 milestones slipped into 2017 or beyond on commercial crew.    General Bolden. Mr. Chairman, I will take that for the record.    To my knowledge, none have slipped that we didn't ask to be slipped for one reason or another, or that we didn't coordinate, you know, with the providers to slip it, because it would be--but I will take that for the record.    Mr. Culberson. Which milestones do you recall----    General Bolden. That is why I said I don't----    Mr. Culberson . Slipped?    General Bolden. I don't think any slipped, but that is why I said, you know, when you talk about, sometimes people use the term slip when in fact we purposely moved something to a later date to accommodate some other test.    So what I would like to do, if it is okay with you, is to take it for the record----    Mr. Culberson. Yes, sir.    General Bolden . And then tell you how any milestones that were scheduled to be done in 2016 are now being done in 2017 and why.    Mr. Culberson. I wanted to also ask about the next generation rocket propulsion.    General Bolden. Yes.    Mr. Culberson. As you look into the future, and the one aspect of the asteroid mission that I think is particularly exciting is the development of the next-generation rocket propulsion, so I want to ask about NASA's work on not only solar electric, nuclear electric, but then also ask about the level of plutonium that you have available.    There is only, as I understand it, about 35 kilograms currently or 77 pounds of plutonium-238 set aside for NASA missions, and this will only support about two or three NASA missions through the middle of the 2020s.    Are you satisfied with the level of funding that you have to understand that the Department of Energy has wanted NASA to take the lead on this? We made sure that you had funding for plutonium-238 production in your 2016 bill.    What do you need from this committee and the Congress in order to make sure that you have got a sufficient supply of plutonium-238 for future missions and which missions do you expect to use plutonium for beyond the 2020, Mars 2020?    General Bolden. As my memory serves me, Mr. Chairman, we have sufficient funding and sufficient sources of plutonium for the missions that are in NASA's plan right now, Mars 2020 being the next mission that will require nuclear fuel.    And in a conversation with Dr. Grunsfeld, the head of the Science Mission Directorate, yesterday when we were talking about Juno that arrives at Jupiter here on Independence Day, you probably know that Juno is not nuclear-powered. Juno is powered by solar arrays, new-generation solar arrays, giant ones. But according to Dr. Grunsfeld yesterday, it is because of the work that we did on Juno and the success of those solar arrays that our team, along with JPL, is now leaning toward solar electric propulsion--solar power, not solar electric propulsion, solar power for Europa, which would mean that we would not need nuclear power for the Europa mission.    But that again, as I mentioned, you know, we won't know that until 2018 when we get to preliminary design review and finish out the formulation of the mission, but that is where it is leaning right now.    Mr. Culberson. If you could, talk to us about the next generation of rocket propulsion. What do you envision being developed to succeed chemical propulsion and what are you doing today to develop that next generation?    General Bolden. When people ask me about going to Mars and what are the challenges, I tell them radiation is one, time is another one. So we need game-changing propulsion, game-changing in-space propulsion.    We are now funding at a very low level development or research on what we call low-grade nuclear fuel, so that we do not have to go through the complicated process that we do now to get, you know, the type of enriched fuel that we use today. That holds out some hope.    There are other systems. People are looking at advanced solar electric propulsion. You have people like Dr. Franklin Chang Diaz has a rocket that is called VASIMR, it is variable specific-impulsed thrust, which is a constantly thrusting ion engine, you know, that we are funding. We are funding the upgrade of a laboratory where he is doing testing now to just see if he can get it ground tested and then we will go see what happens after that.    That type of propulsion systems bode well for the future. But nuclear electric I think is the one that most people tell me is probably going to be what we need, but we have got to get the fuel issue solved first, you know. But we are making slow progress.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Well, General Bolden, we want to thank you again for your service to the country and for the service you have given to NASA, the leadership. It has been a privilege for us to work with you. And we will have a number of questions that we will submit for the record, sir.    But again, from the bottom of our heart, we genuinely appreciate your service to the country. And this subcommittee and the Congress strongly supports the men and women at NASA and we will do everything we can to make sure you have got the resources you need to achieve all that is on your plate, and to ensure that the American space program is the very best in the world bar none.    General Bolden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.                                         Wednesday, March 16, 2016.    Mr. Culberson. The Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee will come to order. We are pleased to have with us this morning the Director of the National Science Foundation, Dr. France Cordova. And we thank you very much for your service to the country, Dr. Cordova. We have on this committee a long history of strong bipartisan support for the work that the National Science Foundation does and a commitment to make sure the United States maintains its leadership in scientific research and the role that you play is absolutely essential.    We have a very difficult budget year but we are going to continue to do everything that we can to ensure that you and the scientists that work under the peer review grant process that you oversee have the resources that you need to maintain American leadership in scientific research.    We have before us the President's 2017 budget request, which is about $7.6 billion, an increase of $101 million, or about 1 percent above the current fiscal year. And unfortunately the President's budget request includes about $400 million in new unauthorized mandatory funding from a variety of sources that are all just not going to happen. It is a difficulty that every agency that is presenting their budgets this year to the Appropriations Committee face. You are not alone in this. And I know this budget did not come from you personally. I understand that you made recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget. They include these extraneous recommendations, the taxes and fee increases and speculative sources of funding for the future that are just simply not going to happen. We had this dilemma with the Administrator of NASA. And we are devoted to NASA and the National Science Foundation. But these mandatory funding increases are simply not going to happen. And it makes it more difficult for the Appropriations Committee to do our work, to support you and help you in an extraordinarily difficult budget year. It complicates things tremendously when the President submits a budget request both for NASA and the National Science Foundation that he knows will never get enacted, that includes funding sources that are utterly unrealistic and improbable. It puts us in an even deeper hole than we are. But we are going to work together. Mr. Honda and I are both, the full subcommittee is committed to work with you and to help you do what you need to do.    I know Mr. Honda joins me in congratulating you and your partners at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and others on the extraordinary discovery that you have made recently using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory in confirming the existence of gravitational waves that I know some of the scientists were up here a couple of weeks ago and my day was just berserk. I am sorry I did not get a chance to meet them personally. But I am looking forward to visiting with them, as I know Mr. Honda is, to hear firsthand about their discovery. We would love to hear you talk a little bit about that today, if you could. In fact, this is something that was theorized by Albert Einstein about a hundred years ago.    In fact the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory was a project that was originally supported by this subcommittee under the leadership of Chairman Livingston and Chairman Rogers. And that work took many years. It requires an investment that the seed has to be planted in the ground and nurtured and carefully supported by subsequent Congresses and subsequent Directors of the National Science Foundation to make sure that they come to fruition. And we will certainly do our part, as I know you will as well. We really do congratulate you and all of the researchers who are involved in this extraordinary achievement.    The National Science Foundation's annual budget represents about 60 percent of the total Federal budget for basic research conducted at U.S. colleges and universities, excluding medical research that is supported by the National Institutes of Health. In many fields the National Science Foundation is the primary source of Federal academic support for scientific research. So we want to add while we wholeheartedly support research and the sciences we of course also need to be exceptionally good stewards of our constituents' hard earned tax dollars and be very careful and frugal about how they are spent. And we are just delighted to have you here with us today and thank you very much for your service. And I want to recognize Mr. Honda for any remarks he would like to make. Thank you.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much, Mr. Honda. And Director Cordova, your written statement will, without objection, be entered into the record in its entirety. And if we could we would welcome your summary of your testimony and if you could keep it within five minutes we would be very grateful. Thank you very much.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much, Dr. Cordova. The LIGO gravitational-wave experiment that you just talked about, were you able to tell the direction from which the wave came or where the black hole merger occurred?    Mr. Culberson. How do they work? And what was the U.S. investment in the LIGO?    Mr. Culberson. Sure. How does it work? And what are the implications of the discovery for what we know about the universe and how it works? Why is it important?    Mr. Culberson. When were gamma rays and x-rays first detected?    Mr. Culberson. But x-rays were first seen over 100 years ago.    Mr. Culberson. Correct.    Mr. Culberson. Right.    Mr. Culberson. Sure.    Mr. Culberson. Yes, I just mentioned it because what an extraordinarily exciting time to be alive when you can begin to discuss here the concept of a gravitational wave spectrum.    Mr. Culberson. That is an extraordinary concept and very exciting to be alive at this moment in history. And for us to be able to help make sure this continues, that we continue to expand the width of our ability to perceive and detect gravitational waves. Now we are starting with obviously the brightest and the biggest source of gravitational waves and it is just an extraordinary discovery and we congratulate you. And who knows, maybe with the work that we do in expanding America's space program maybe we can eventually have a GRACE type spacecraft using lasers and we can go to the outer solar system and we can expand your gravitational wave detection using lasers similar to the GRACE spacecraft measuring the distance between the spacecraft here at Earth and then far out in the solar system to measure the, did you say the width of an atom?    Mr. Culberson. Is the detection capability of the LIGO?    Mr. Culberson. And that is what enables you to see----    Mr. Culberson. The distance between these two observational points deep within the Earth, I understand they are very deep in the ground?    Mr. Culberson. I am thinking about the neutrinos. This is, I am thinking about neutrinos.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much. Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you. Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Kilmer.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much, Mr. Kilmer. Dr. Cordova, if I could I wanted to follow up on the, I have always been a big fan of the decadal surveys when it comes to NASA.    Mr. Culberson. I have included language in our bill this year to encourage NASA to follow the recommendations of the decadal survey in each of the major survey areas and am delighted to hear that you have got a similar process that I look forward to learning more about. But if you could just reiterate some of what you said to Mr. Jolly and describe for us how is their decadal survey process at the National Science Foundation? And how do they map out a blueprint for the decade ahead for the type of research that you need to do?    Mr. Culberson. What did you mean when you said there was a decadal survey?    Mr. Culberson. Sure, that makes sense.    Mr. Culberson. Synoptic----    Mr. Culberson. Do you then meet with NASA officials and decide who is going to take what piece? Or do you collaborate with NASA, for example?    Mr. Culberson. Also produced by the National Academy?    Mr. Culberson. So then do you collaborate with NOAA, for example, to decide what portion of the oceanographic decadal that they will fund and follow versus the portions you----    Mr. Culberson. You do not talk to them?    Mr. Culberson. Correct. Of course.    Mr. Culberson. But there is no formal standardized procedure to collaborate with either NOAA or NASA to decide what portion of the decadal you are going to work on versus NASA or NOAA?    Mr. Culberson. It sounds like it is sort of an informal process.    Mr. Culberson. OK.    Mr. Culberson. The reason I ask is I want also to avoid directorate level funding.    Mr. Culberson. I think it is important that we not insert----    Mr. Culberson . Political agendas from either end of the political spectrum, from any part of the political spectrum, in the work that the scientific community does. But I am very impressed with the work of the decadal survey that the National Academies have done in their decadal surveys. And that is why I included language in our 2016 bill to ensure that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, we gave them direction to follow the decadal recommendations because of the superb quality of the work. It is a blueprint for the next decade.    Mr. Culberson. It allows us as members of Congress----    Mr. Culberson . To recognize what the priorities are of the scientific community in their best objective judgment and fund those priorities and make sure that they are carried out. Because these discoveries, as the gravitational wave discovery, has taken a couple of decades to achieve.    Mr. Culberson. These are long term, very expensive, very difficult achievements that we cannot always be sure----    Mr. Culberson . When we make the investment at the front end where it is going to wind up at the back end.    Mr. Culberson . It is our job as policy makers to make good decisions based on accurate, objective, factual data. That is all we are looking for. So the decadal survey is of keen interest to me and I am glad Mr. Jolly asked the question. Because that was something I intended to pursue with you separately and privately and I am glad he brought it up. Because we need to have, I think, a decadal survey, or find a way to have a decadal survey for the National Science Foundation, as NASA has for the space program, so we can see as policy makers what the next decade----    Mr. Culberson . What the needs are for the next decade--    Mr. Culberson . What amount of money will be necessary. Frankly I would love to also, I have been working with Mr. Fattah and Mr. Honda, all the members of this subcommittee, I really want to cut the Office of Management and Budget out of the loop for NASA and the National Science Foundation. I do not think the bean counters, the bureaucratic bean counters at OMB should be substituting their judgment for the work that you do or the work that NASA does. They ought to be able to give us an accurate, honest assessment----    Mr. Culberson . Of what your needs are----    Mr. Culberson. Sergeant? I like that. Sergeant Friday, everyone.    Mr. Culberson. Yes.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much. Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Ms. Roby.    Mr. Fattah.    Mr. Culberson. Mr. Jolly.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Honda.    Dr. Cordova, I am aware that National Science Foundation, under your leadership, has implemented new policies to clarify that the abstract for an award must serve the public--as the public justification for NSF funding by articulating how the project serves the national interest and that NSF has also issued a resolution in May 2015 that strongly endorses the principle that all foundation funded research and education must further the national interest by contributing to the foundation's mission.    Could you explain to us what processes NSF has implemented to ensure that all grants funded are in the national interest?    Mr. Culberson. Thank you.    Mr. Honda.    Mr. Culberson. Thank you, Mr. Honda.    I will do one more set of questions and I believe we need to wrap up. Mr. Honda has a commitment. And I do want to focus, if I could, Dr. Cordova, on the National Ecological Observatory Network. Last year, NSF identified an $80 million cost overrun for the NEON project. And as a result, as required by the NSF, NEON will de-scope the project, which includes decreasing the number of sites from 106 to 82, and I know you have also brought on new management.    If the network is not entirely built, why do you need $65 million additional funding for operations, especially if the network is going to include nearly 25 percent fewer sites than originally planned? And what steps has NSF taken to ensure the program is, quite frankly, properly run, and that you have got a greater degree of rigor in management, and to prevent cost overruns?place last Friday so they can assume management responsibility for the project. There will be a 90-day transition period where the final costs to construct and operate NEON will be negotiated between Battelle and the National Science Foundation.    And that has always been the plan--to get them on board as soon as possible because, in their proposal, they have new ideas about how to accelerate the scheduling and, thereby, it may not cost as much. So it is just essential to get them going as soon as possible, but we also have to give them the opportunity to really understand the full cost.    As far as the science is concerned, when we realized last spring/summer that we were facing a potential $80 million cost overrun, we asked the advisory committee to the biology directorate to stand up a task force, if you will, a subcommittee, under their aegis, of top scientists. I mean, these are National Academy standing scientists from around the country to come together and to look at what was proposed originally for NEON and what the budget constraints and all were now, and that we did not want to have a cost overrun, and considering that there was a de-scoping plan on the table, could they assess the de-scoped plan and let us know whether there was a lot of transformative science to be had with the de-scoped plan.    And so they did that. They did that on an amazingly short time scale, which just shows the power of the science community to come together and to quickly do such an important assessment. And they came back, and they said that absolutely that they thought that great science could be achieved with the proposed de-scoping from the number of sites that you mentioned, but no more de-scoping because we do have to preserve the original mission of NEON.    And so we think that by accelerating schedule and also--just to go back to the discussion about computers, and Mr. Honda's questions about how we were involving the best computational capabilities--we think by revolutionizing the computer approaches to this observatory as well, that we can also realize some efficiency in gains.    And so, you know, time will out: we will find out how well we have done, but we think that Battelle has produced an exceptional proposal in every aspect, including involving the science community. And we have very high hopes, and with our very close involvement--and believe me, I have weekly meetings with my senior staff on NEON--that this is an all-hands effort to make sure that this problem is resolved in short order of any potential overruns, and that this program delivers incredible value to the public.    Mr. Culberson. So in addition to weekly meetings, what other steps have you formally instituted to be sure that you have got the proper oversight to ensure that Battelle is not--you do not have the same problem you did before with the other management?    Mr. Culberson. Thank you very much, Dr. Cordova.    Do have one more question?    Mr. Culberson. Sure.    Mr. Culberson. I hope your policy is zero tolerance.    Mr. Culberson. It is terrific that you are focusing on this and ensuring that everyone is treated with professionalism, respect, and courtesy. Thank you very much for your service to the country. We will have a series of questions we will submit for the record. I ask you to respond to in writing, and with greater specificity. But above all, we thank you for your service. And the hearing is adjourned. Thank you.
