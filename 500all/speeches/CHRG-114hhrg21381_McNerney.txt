So U.S. consumers are buying products made overseas that are potentially less efficient and cost American jobs at the same time?    Mr. McNerney. How could we remedy that situation?    Mr. McNerney. So this is an enforcement issue it is not a trade rules issue?    Mr. McNerney. OK, very good. Mr. Eckman, please elaborate a little bit if you would on how the rulemaking process could be improved, the transparency of the rulemaking process could be improved?    Mr. McNerney. Thank you. Mr. Cosgriff again, I am going to ask do you believe that the current standards are room to drive more innovation?    Mr. McNerney. Can drive more innovation?    Mr. McNerney. Thank you. Ms. Noll, could you give some examples of efficiency improvements that are still possible?    Mr. McNerney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
