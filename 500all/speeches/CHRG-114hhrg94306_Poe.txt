    Mr. Poe. Mr. Chairman, Iran will lie until the truth will suit them better. We cannot trust Iran and I see no convincing evidence that we can verify them sticking to the final deal.    Iran is still lying about its past nuclear activities. There is no reason to hope or believe Iran will start telling the truth and being honest once sanction relief comes. This hope is delusional.    After the deal to make a deal, as I call it, Supreme Leader Khamenei said there was no deal and still screams ``Death to the United States.'' The White House said sanctions would be lifted gradually. President Rouhani publicly demanded that the sanctions be lifted on the first day of the agreement.    The military has insisted that there will be no inspection of military facilities. The sides don't even agree on what this little deal may be. Iran could very well outsource its nuclear program to North Korea to avoid inspections altogether.    We cannot trust this regime. Iran has proven time and again to be deceitful and a dangerous state sponsor of terror hell bent on lying and cheating its way to obtain nuclear weapons, developing ICBMs to deliver these nukes while being a threat to the world and their own people.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
