    Mr. Byrne. Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen, and both of you have good, strong long-time connections to the State of Alabama. Secretary Lehman is from my hometown in Mobile, and Admiral, you are a son of the State of Alabama. We appreciate both of you and thank you for your service.    Two weeks ago I was in China at a conference, and one of the days in conference we spent talking about the military situation there. We had a representative from the United States side, and a representative from the Chinese side. And the Chinese representative was remarkably candid and very worrisome. I would like to read a portion, just a few sentences of what he had to say, and ask you to react to it. To some extent, I think, Admiral, you have already addressed it, but I would like for you to be a little more specific about what we would do in response to this. But, listen to what he said. You know, this is the Chinese speaking:    ``As is well known, security frictions between China and the U.S. for a long time have occurred mainly within the first island chain. Chinese efforts to secure reunification across the Taiwanese Strait and to safeguard its territory, sovereignty, and maritime rights and interests in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, face incessant U.S. interference and intervention.'' And here is the key sentence. ``The development of a new balance of power will be marked by China's enhanced capacity to safeguard its territory and sovereignty and maritime rights and interests and a weakened U.S. capability to intervene.'' That is the Chinese perspective on us.    So if we are going to reverse that, specifically, what do we need to do?    Mr. Byrne. Mr. Secretary.    Mr. Byrne. My time is up. I really appreciate your comments. Thank you.
