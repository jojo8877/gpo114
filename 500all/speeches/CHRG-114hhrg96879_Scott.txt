    Mr. Scott. Go Dogs.    The Chairman. Dr. Buhler, please.         STATEMENT OF DOUGLAS D. BUHLER, Ph.D., SENIOR         DIRECTOR, MSU AgBioResearch, EAST LANSING, MI    Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Lacy, I will be stepping out after my questions because I have an Armed Services Committee as well at the same time, but I do want to thank you for being here and I appreciate your kind comments. My professors might take issue with you at the University of Georgia. But we are the leading producer of poultry in the U.S., and as you testified in your opening statement, a serious outbreak of avian influenza would be devastating to our state's economy, and especially to certain regions of our state and our food supply. This avian influenza has been around a long time. It is something that we just now seem to be coming to grips with that it is here in our country and a major risk for us. Can you explain in more details the work that you are doing to help the producers to help protect the poultry flocks from avian influenza, and what other potential diseases are there that we see in other countries that have not yet made it to America?    Mr. Scott. What is the difference this year and in prior years? Why did it get ahead of us this year instead of us controlling it the way we had in the past?    Mr. Scott. Have you been able to partner with the ARS facilities and other universities on this, or did you speak to potentially CDC and other government agencies, and how you are able to coordinate and work together?    Mr. Scott. Well, I want to thank all of you for being here. And, Mr. Chairman, this just reemphasizes the value of not only research in agriculture, but extension, that protects the food supply of the United States and, quite honestly, the largest food supply in the world.    So thank you all for what you do. I certainly appreciate you being here, and I hope to see you in Athens.    The Chairman. Thank you to my colleague from Georgia. And I also want to give him a thanks because he is my predecessor in this chair for this Subcommittee, and did a great job during the last Congress too, so thank you.    I tried to avoid the next questioner by going to Mr. Peterson, but, Jim, he didn't have any questions, so I am going to you.
