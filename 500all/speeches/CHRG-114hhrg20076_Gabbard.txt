    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you.    General Lyons, can you speak to your Ready Reserve Force requirements and whether or not you have enough of your either organic mariners or commercial vessels to meet that requirement?    General Lyons. Yes, ma'am. Today we have a capability that I believe is sufficient to meet the national military strategy's requirements with acceptable risk.    The issue we face is where we will be tomorrow. We see some downward trends that are significant in nature, one of which is the health of the merchant mariner industry that we have been discussing and those mariners that not only sail our commercial vessels, but also sail our Ready Reserve Force fleet, our surge fleet crew, our pre-positioned equipment that is out there today.    So we believe we are in good shape now, but we do have some concerns about where we are headed in that as well as the age-out of the organic fleet.    Ms. Gabbard. Similarly, you have talked about the importance of the Maritime Security Program as it relates to your ability to respond and move people and logistics, et cetera. What is the fleet size requirement of the Maritime Security Program?    Ms. Gabbard. Assuming that you do have losses and being able to account for that.    Ms. Gabbard. Right, right. Okay, thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
