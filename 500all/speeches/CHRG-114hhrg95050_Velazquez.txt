    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Director Cordray, Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires banks and lenders to collect and report credit application data on small businesses as well as minority- and women-owned businesses.    Can you elaborate on how collecting this information will help enforce fair lending laws and enable lenders to identify opportunities for improvement in their served communities?    Ms. Velazquez. So when can we expect the CFPB to publish rules? Do you think before the end of the year or after?    Ms. Velazquez. It is a very important part of the law and it helps us here understand the dynamics in terms of small business lending.    Ms. Velazquez. New York consumers submit thousands of debt collection complaints to the Bureau every year. As you know, onerous and illegal debt collection practices can be a significant burden to families' finances and ability to obtain credit.    It is our understanding that CFPB is in the process of drafting a rule to address these complaints. Can you describe the main tenets of the rule and the types of abusive collection activities you hope to eliminate?    Ms. Velazquez. Do you have a timeline as to when a rule will be released?    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
