    Mr. Hudson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I am pleased today to introduce Fred Wells Brason, a former hospice chaplain, now President and CEO of Project Lazarus from my home State of North Carolina. Mr. Brason has had tremendous success in saving lives from opioid overdoses, and I look forward to hearing his testimony and learning from his great work.
