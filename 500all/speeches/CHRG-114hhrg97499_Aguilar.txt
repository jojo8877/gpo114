    Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you for being here, gentlemen.    This one is for the group.    And as it was mentioned in the Wolfsthal and Lewis, the Trillion Dollar Triad report, Dr. Mount, you mentioned that in your testimony a few times, and the cost estimate of a trillion dollars to upgrade our nuclear triad over the next 30 years.    Based on this mind-boggling figure, how can we, regardless of the strategic argument, realistically talk about developing and deploying lower-yield weapons when clearly now and in the future some of these serious investments that we need to make, some serious investments in our conventional capabilities, with finite dollars available to us, it is imperative that they be invested wisely.    And I give you some credit because in your testimony you do talk about some of the financial implications as well. Can you expand on that?    Mr. Aguilar. Anyone else?    Mr. Aguilar. I think the chairman would also convey that that reduction to readiness was a reduction of the increase to readiness, which a lot of other members advocated for as well.    One additional point. Instead of--are any of you concerned about, you know, with the lower-yield weapon that we are discussing, you know, that this investment would give other countries more of a reason to invest in their own nuclear arsenals and maintaining this constant drumbeat of the arms race?    And some of you allude to that in your testimony, but would anyone like to expand on their concerns with respect to that point?    Mr. Colby and then Dr. Murdock.    Mr. Aguilar. Apologies, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Aguilar. Apologies.
