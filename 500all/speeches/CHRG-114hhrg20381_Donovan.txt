    Mr. Donovan. Thank you, Chairman. I would like to thank Subcommittee Chairman Matt Salmon and Ranking Member Brad Sherman along with their staffs for holding this hearing.    Although I am not a member of this committee, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak here today. The relationship between the United States and Sri Lanka is important to my district of Staten Island and western Brooklyn because I represent the largest population of Sri Lankans in the United States. And welcome, Professor. It is great to have another New Yorker in the room.    Many of my constituents are ethnic Tamils and left Sri Lanka during the civil war that lasted 26 years. They could not have been more relieved when it ended in 2009 and elections were conducted in 2015.    These elections in Sri Lanka have provided an opening for change and reforms that have been taken place. However, I am not sure if the reforms have gone far enough. So U.S. attention and encouragement remains vital.    In particular, the reforms needed for reconciliation between Sinhalese and Tamils, Hindus, Christians, Muslims and Buddhists after a long war have not yet been accomplished.    We need security sector reform to reorient the military for peace time, political reform to provide greater autonomy for regional governments, and legal reform for neutrality of the judiciary and criminalization.    Criminalizing terrible abuses such as enforced disappearances, war crimes and crimes against humanity remain as important tasks for the future.    Sri Lanka has made important commitments in the area of accountability and transactional justice and needs to be held to those commitments in the areas of truth telling, justice, reparations and institutional reforms so that reconciliation can take place.    I look forward to hearing from the witnesses and reporting back to my constituents, and I yield back the remainder of my time, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Donovan. I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much.    I am curious--why do you think the judicial process is so slow? Over 200 Tamils held under these same laws at this moment 7 years after the war has ended. Like, why do you believe that this process is so slow for these individuals?    Anyone, yeah.    Mr. Donovan. Is it true that some of the names aren't even released yet?    Mr. Donovan. I am sorry. I didn't want to cut you off.    Mr. Donovan. Can the United States do anything about this? What is the United States' role here as people back home see?    Mr. Donovan. Right. And so--and this will be my last question because I want the other members speak because the chairman said we have to run and vote momentarily--the United States' role here--besides suggesting, trying to influence, trying to persuade corrections in this system that you just described as so wrong, is there a role here for the United States besides just as an advisor of telling people this--what you are doing here is wrong and that the effects on women, as you just spoke about, are something that the United States disapproves of.    Just disapproving it is not going to get this to move any further along in the process. What is our role here?    Mr. Donovan. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
