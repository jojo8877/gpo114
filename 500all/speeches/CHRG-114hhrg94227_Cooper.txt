    Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    In view of the tightness of the schedule, I will just submit my statement for the record.    Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I certainly second your strong objection to sequestration for the defense budget. I just hope that we can at least reach the President's budget levels and do that honestly.    I regret the failure of any committee, but it was a little bit heartening last night that the Budget Committee failed to get a budget. And I think they are starting to listen to the members of this committee and others saying that you need to plug that defense hole and you need to plug it with real dollars, not borrowed dollars from China.    It was interesting yesterday that Senate Republicans objected to the way we were trying to plug the hole. And I don't know what their method is, but we have got to do this honestly and not just rely on the Chinese to fund our needs.    Apart from these urgent sequestration issues, I thought we should spend a moment on that memo from Greenert and Odierno to the Secretary of Defense back from November 5, 2014, because it uses nice bureaucratic language.    But I think the message of this memo is pretty important and pretty daunting. The first sentence says, ``The growing challenges associated with ballistic missile defense are increasingly capable and continue to outpace our active defense systems.''    Admiral Syring just said that we will be overmatched 2020 unless we do things right. This kind of implies we are being overmatched. And harsher language would say we are kind of losing right now.    Later in the memo it says, ``Our present acquisition-based strategy is unsustainable in the current fiscal environment.'' ``Unsustainable'' is a polite word for saying that we don't have enough money, this isn't fixable. And I don't know whether they meant to not only fix sequestration, but go beyond that.    But it also has a little bit of a tone here at least vis-a-vis other military necessities that they feel MDA is being something of a resource hog because you all are getting money that they could use for readiness or other needs that are not being met.    I don't want to read too much into this. But to have Greenert and Odierno write something like this is pretty astonishing because it is harsher criticism than the committee has ever levied. You throw this in with a recent GAO report talking about smaller issues and we have a lot of work to do.    I worry, for example, that--you know, lots of people talk and we are underway in looking at four east coast sites. But will we have the money, the $3 or $4 billion, to do those? Because we have to admit to ourselves that is a lower priority for MDA than discrimination of targets and redesigning the kill vehicle and things like that.    So, being straightforward here, we have got to not only fix sequestration, we have got to have a strategy that seems to work better against ballistic missile threats. And Greenert and Odierno talk about things like ``left of launch'' and non-kinetic means of defense, lots of things that are strategic decisions that we need to make sure we are on top of, because this same old, same old won't necessarily fix the problem.    So we trust you gentlemen. We hope it is working. But this is kind of a vote of no confidence here from two of the most important people in the military.    So what do we do to best fix their concerns?    Mr. Cooper. Chief of Staff of the Army, not the Air Force.    Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. McKeon.    Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Our colleague, John Garamendi, has been called away to California for a family emergency. But he wanted these two questions asked; so, I will do so on his behalf.    Number one, directed energy. How much money is needed to advance directed energy research at the most rapid pace possible?    Mr. Cooper. Thank you. Second question is: How much progress is being made on improving the reliability of current antimissile interceptors? Do we have a reasonable chance of defending the United States today with the current inventory?    Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Cooper. This week is so crucial because what we are really talking here is fixing a problem that will otherwise plague us for the next 7 years. So if we can get a better outcome now, we could be saving you gentlemen and your successors a 7-year nightmare here. So these talks like Mr. Brooks was talking about with the chairman is a very important time for the military to weigh in, very clearly.    Mr. Cooper. Where do reliability and improving shot doctrine rank in your priorities? Why?    Mr. Cooper. Where do reliability and improving shot doctrine rank in your priorities? Why?    Mr. Cooper. What are the risks of not conducting a flight test before producing the SM3-IB interceptors? How much would a flight test cost, versus a ground test?    Mr. Cooper. Where do reliability and improving shot doctrine rank in your priorities? Why?    Mr. Cooper. How do you plan beyond 2020?    Mr. Cooper. Are we on track for deployment of the Aegis Ashore site in Poland in 2018? What are the risks of accelerating this deployment to 2017? Are you able to accelerate the schedule for operational availability at this point and would you recommend acceleration? And would you then need additional SM3-IB interceptors? What would the cost be?    Mr. Cooper. Where do reliability and improving shot doctrine rank in your priorities? Why?    General Mann. Operational reliability is my top priority. It provides the Warfighter confidence to execute the mission. We continue to support the Missile Defense Agency's investments to the existing ground-based interceptor (GBI) inventory and the development of new GBI capabilities.    I defer to NORTHCOM regarding the potential impact of improved reliability on any modifications to the current shot doctrine.                                 ______
