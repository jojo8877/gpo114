    Mr. Byrne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And I might note for the panel that my Uncle Jack graduated from the Merchant Marine Academy and unfortunately, like so many of the men that served in World War II, he was lost at sea. So I know that the people that participate in this activity are not doing so risk free. And I appreciate every day what you do and the sacrifice that the people that you work with make.    Mr. DiLisio, I want to talk to you, and I get confused by the acronyms, too, about the Expeditionary Fast Transport Vessel, the EPF. I don't know why it is not the EFT, but it is the EPF, so I will get used to that.    As I understand it, the original plan was to build 18. We have delivered six and six are in various phases of construction or have been contracted for at the very least.    In the last 2 years, the administration has not asked for any additional of these vessels, but the Congress has gone ahead and authorized and appropriated one each year.    So you just described that the missions that that vessel can perform have actually broadened. You have discovered more things that it can do.    Talk a little bit about how important that vessel is and what you would be able to do if you had the full complement of 18.    Mr. Byrne. Sometimes news up here is noise.    Mr. Byrne. It does. But expand upon the various things that you are finding out, even though some of it is experimental. What are the various new things that you are finding out that it can do?    Mr. Byrne. Well, I thank you all for what you do. We need to do a better job, I think we all agree on that, in supporting what you do. Because your support capability and your support activities are so very important to our ability to defend the country. So I know our other members of the subcommittee, we are all going to try to find some way to help you out. But it is a tough budget environment.    So thank you, and I yield back.
