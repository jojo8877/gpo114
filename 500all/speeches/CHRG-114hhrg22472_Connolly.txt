    Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Barr, I must say I am reeling from the stunning revelation that you have no emails from two former Secretaries of State who covered the entirety of the Bush administration. And I want to make sure I understood your answers to Mr. Cummings very clearly. You are the top FOIA official at the Department of State. Is that correct?    Mr. Connolly. And if I understand your sworn testimony, you're saying that as of right now the State Department has not been able to identify any emails from Secretary Powell or Secretary Rice. Is that correct?    Mr. Connolly. Do you have other emails?    Mr. Connolly. Well, now, Ms. Barr, my time is limited.    Mr. Connolly. I'm going to help you clarify your testimony.    Mr. Connolly. So are you saying you actually do have emails from Secretary Powell, they just----    Mr. Connolly. I'm asking is there any evidence at all of any emails from Secretary Powell on his official or personal email accounts that you have access to as the head FOIA official for the Department of State?    Mr. Connolly. Really, for 4 long years?    Mr. Connolly. Yes. But please do so in a concise fashion. I only have 5 minutes.    Mr. Connolly. Go ahead.    Mr. Connolly. No, you keep on using that phrase. Do you have any emails from Colin Powell that you have access to?    Mr. Connolly. You're not sure.    Mr. Connolly. Do you have access to any--since you're not sure about Colin Powell, which I still find stunning--there's no evidence of any, but you're not sure. What about Secretary Condoleezza Rice, do you have----    Mr. Connolly. So you have access----    Mr. Connolly. What do you mean by responsive material?    Mr. Connolly. Yeah.    Mr. Connolly. And your testimony was there is no evidence of extant emails from her responsive to the request.    Mr. Connolly. None.    Mr. Connolly. So what happened to them?    Mr. Connolly. But there are some emails from her. You're not sure about Colin Powell, but you are sure about Secretary Rice?    Mr. Connolly. Which means they're preserved somewhere.    Mr. Connolly. Have you ever seen one?    Mr. Connolly. I find that amazing as well. Does the Federal Records Act apply to both Secretaries Powell and Secretary Rice?    Mr. Connolly. I understand that, but let's stick with emails for a minute.    Mr. Connolly. So is it compliant with the Federal Records Act to in fact wipe out emails----    Mr. Connolly. --whether they are on your personal account or your official account?    Mr. Connolly. Right.    Mr. Connolly. So just to summarize, and please correct me if I get it wrong, your testimony is you're unaware of any surviving emails from Secretary Powell responsive----    Mr. Connolly. I understand. But you have a title. Presumably you'd know, if anyone knew. But we'll use your phrase, responsive to the request.    Mr. Connolly. In that lane, there are no surviving emails from Secretary Colin Powell that you're aware of?    Mr. Connolly. And with respect to Secretary Rice, similarly, you're unaware of any surviving emails from Secretary Rice responsive to the request?    Mr. Connolly. There may be or, in fact, your guess is there are surviving emails from her, but they are outside that lane of responsive to the request?    Mr. Connolly. Thank you.
