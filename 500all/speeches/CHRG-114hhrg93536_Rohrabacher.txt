    Mr. Rohrabacher. Thank you.    First of all, I would like to thank both you and the ranking member for the leadership you have provided on this, and on this and a lot of issues that we have been facing. This is a really contentious time in our history, and we are lucky to have both of you and giving this committee and all of the rest of us the guidance and leadership we need.    I would just like to add on this particular bill, where we are focusing on North Korea, I would like to make sure that we go on the record--or at least I am on the record--as pointing out that many of the things that we are blaming North Korea for, which they deserve blame for, can be traced back to the influences of Beijing on their policies. The Communist Chinese, I am of certainty, are helping them in their efforts when it comes to nuclear weapons development, for example, and cyberattacks. I do not believe that all of these activities, which are criminal activities against the West and trying to put us in jeopardy and also especially aimed at putting Japan, we have to understand that much of what is going on in North Korea is aimed at sort of a--giving an ominous threat to Japan. And the Japanese are fully aware that this isn't just coming from North Korea. It is Beijing giving a message to Japan through their puppet state in North Korea. So I, just for the record, I want to make sure that we understand this is a chess game going on here, and the and the main player on the other side is Beijing. So thank you very much to both of you, and I, of course, urge your support for this resolution.
