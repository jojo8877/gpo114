    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I apologize for having had to leave. Very troubling. I have what may be a character flaw for this committee. I tend to give the benefit of the doubt.    So, Ms. Archuleta, I would like to give you the benefit of the doubt, but the flash report really is quite concerning to me. So, Mr. McFarland, a quote from that says, ``In our opinion, the project management approach for this major infrastructure overhaul is entirely inadequate and introduces a very high risk of project failure.''    Having sat here and listened to multiple hours now in this hearing, would you say that your level of confidence in OPM is heightened, or do you stand by that comment?    Mr. DeSaulnier. And you also asked for responses from OPM. It says you asked for it on June 2 of 2015, and you asked for comments by June 5, and then later extended that to June 10. By June 17, we had still not received comments or indication that comments would be forthcoming. Did you ever get comments back before the hearing?    Mr. DeSaulnier. Okay. Well, I got something this morning, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, actions to strengthen cybersecurity and protect critical IT systems. It doesn't have a specific date, June 2015. But, Ms. Archuleta, is this the response that you provided the IG, or is this for the committee? It is a 7-page report.    Mr. DeSaulnier. So, Mr. McFarland, heretofore you haven't got that kind of impression--at least that's my impression from your testimony--I am sorry, you were distracted for a second.    Mr. DeSaulnier. That Ms. Archuleta said she valued your input and looked forward to working with you. But, heretofore, you haven't gotten that, from what I ascertained from your comments today and the written commentary.    Mr. DeSaulnier. Do you have any heightened confidence that what Ms. Archuleta just said about your relationship will improve? It doesn't seem there is any evidence to that.    Mr. DeSaulnier. That's fairly significant. As you said to Mr. Lynch, $93 million you said isn't even close to the amount needed in your opinion and that the ability to succeed--there is a high risk that these efforts will ultimately be unsuccessful. Given how horrible the consequences of what has already happened doesn't really give me a lot of confidence that going forward anything is going to improve. As a matter of fact, it sounds like it is going to get worse.    Mr. DeSaulnier. Would you like to respond to that, Ms. Archuleta? And I can only imagine how difficult it is coming in here. But I must tell you, just sitting here and being willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, you appear to come across as petulant, defensive, and evasive.    Mr. DeSaulnier. You said that over and over again. With all due respect, I believe you, but it doesn't appear to be the truth.    Mr. DeSaulnier. So I just, personal observation, sometimes you can feel passionate about things but not be capable of doing what you desire to do. And I think we need to have a serious conversation. I know the chairman has these concerns about, to be perfectly honest, whether the current administration is competent enough to protect this information from people who would hack us.    Mr. DeSaulnier. Yeah.
