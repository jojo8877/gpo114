    Mr. Knight. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    So I'm just going to go down the kind of time frame here and who's involved. We have seven members involved, and we have about a 30-year process of where we started on this and now we're talking about another--maybe a ten-year process before we get to a--kind of a working model for lack of a better term here.    In every situation when we talk about a long-term project, we're always talking about cost, we're always talking about who's involved and maybe if we need to get more money, then we have to look at those members, or has anyone talked about bringing in other countries, other members into this agreement? Yes, sir.    Mr. Knight. Okay.    Mr. Knight. Okay. Very good. And I'm to understand that the ITER project is the closest project in this form of technology anywhere in the world, is that correct?    Mr. Knight. You're my expert.    Mr. Knight. Okay. And my last question is a question I always put to my son is that do you think we're smart enough to do some of the things today? And the answer is always we may or may not be smart enough to do some of these things. The fact of the matter is for the supercomputing that is happening today, we are way smarter today than we might have been ten years ago with the advancements in computers, with the advancements that we have done over the last ten years to get us to where we are.    So in ten years from now, hopefully, we have this model, hopefully, we are on schedule and we are hitting all the points that we're supposed to for this project. But over those ten years, computers are going to be infinitely better at what they do, compared to today. We are going to know an awful lot more in ten years than we know today.    So with all of that being said, I hear from all three of the panelists that it is very hopeful and possible that we will be there in ten years to have this project up and running. And I am getting that from all three of my panelists, is that correct?    Mr. Knight. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. And I think we were just invited to southern France.
