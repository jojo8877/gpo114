    Mr. Cummings. Mr. Chairman, I will be brief because I know you want to get to your questions.    First of all, I want to welcome you to your chairmanship and to the committee. I want to thank our Ranking Member. Congratulations to both of you.    The issue of cyber security has been one which I have been trying to raise before this committee for years. I give credit to you and Chairman Chaffetz for addressing it now because it is so very, very important.    I have a lot of questions but I want to let the Chairman ask his questions.    I sit on the Naval Academy Board of Trustees and Board of Visitors. We understand that cyber security is so very important. We have done a lot to make sure that all of our midshipmen are exposed to cyber security education.    Do you think that we are preparing our Nation and our young people and the troops to be able to effectively deal with this very, very serious threat to our way of life, to our existence?    Right now, we are dealing with the Secret Service. You see situations where people say we are prepared but when it comes time for the rubber to meet the road, you discover there is no road.    I am wondering how you all feel about our colleges, universities and other institutions? Are we where we need to be to effectively deal with this serious problem?    Mr. Cummings. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
