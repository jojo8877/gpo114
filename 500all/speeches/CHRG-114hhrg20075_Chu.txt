    Ms. CHU. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Ms. Glas, my state of California is home to the largest manufacturing base in the country, and, it has some of the strongest carbon reduction policies in the nation. In fact, California is responsible for about 11 percent of the nation's manufacturing production. Can you tell us about how Federal and state governments can encourage industry growth to ensure that the clean energy economy is developing good manufacturing jobs in the U.S.?    Ms. CHU. How about some of these tax credits? For instance, how has the long-term extension of the production tax credit and the investment tax credit impacted clean energy manufacturers?    Ms. CHU. The research and development tax credit was made permanent. How could this R&D credit be made to be more business friendly?    Ms. CHU. Mr. Tillman, I enjoyed your story on reshoring which is when a company shifts manufacturing back to the U.S., jobs are not only created at the new factory but at many surrounding business, like parts suppliers, restaurants, and real estate agents. Can you elaborate on this secondary economic impact of reshoring manufacturing?    Ms. CHU. Anyone else on the panel?    How could we invent, incentivize, and increase in the purchases made by large businesses from small business suppliers and reshoring? Is there a way we could do that?    Ms. CHU. Thank you.
