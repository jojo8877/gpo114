    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you for your appearance today, Mr. Werkheiser.    I assume the lab lost a significant amount of credibility when the disclosure was made. What is really amazing and troubling among many details of this case is that the lab went ahead as if nothing occurred, and you doubled down on a $174,000 piece of equipment that no one either knew how to operate, cared enough to operate correctly, or was even interested enough to oversee.    How do you justify buying a new piece of equipment like a mass spectrometer when no one was willing to verify that it was operated correctly?    Mrs. Radewagen. We have one report stating the lab had an average turnaround time of 224 days to process samples. Did the lab have a reputation for long turnaround times to process samples?    Mrs. Radewagen. So, coupled with knowledge that the lab had a history of inaccuracies and slow turnaround, why was management so complacent, or as the Scientific Integrity Review Panel described, characterized by conscious acquiescence and inattentiveness? Didn't that ultimately let the fraud continue until 2014?    Mrs. Radewagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
