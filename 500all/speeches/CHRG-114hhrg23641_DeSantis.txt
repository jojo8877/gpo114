    Mr.  DeSantis. The Subcommittee on National Security and the Subcommittee on Government Operations will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time.    The United States confronts a wide array of threats at its borders, ranging from terrorists seeking to harm the United States to transnational criminals smuggling drugs and counterfeit goods to foreign nationals entering illegally in order to work in the United States unlawfully.    America's borders and ports are busy places. Every year, tens of millions of cargo containers and hundreds of millions of lawful travelers enter the country, while tens of thousands of illegal cargo entries are seized and hundreds of thousands of unauthorized migrants are arrested or denied entry.    At the same time, hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants evade detection to enter the United States unlawfully and thousands of kilograms of illegal drugs and other contraband are smuggled into the country.    Recent terrorist attacks in the United States and Europe and worldwide have highlighted the national security challenges that we face. The November terrorist attacks in Paris transformed Europe's migration crisis into a security debate, spurring calls for European nations to reevaluate their open border policies. Yesterday's terrorist attacks in Brussels demonstrate the strength of the Islamic State, but also highlight the policies of European nations that have facilitated the establishment and growth of Islamic communities within these countries that are parallel to rather than integrated in Western society.    Concerns about borders are not limited to Europe. Recent reports state that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years.    The Texas Department of Public Safety has reported that border security agencies have arrested several Somali immigrants crossing the southern border who are known members of al-Shabaab, the terrorist group that launched the deadly attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, as well as other Somali-based groups, including one funded by Osama bin Laden.    The Texas DPS stated that it had come into contact in recent years with ``special interest aliens'' who come from countries with known ties to terrorists or where terrorist groups thrive.    In all, immigrants from over 30 countries throughout Asia and the Middle East have been arrested over the past few years trying to enter the United States illegally in the Rio Grande Valley. Now the committee has obtained information from the Customs and Border Protection that confirms thousands of Indians, Chinese, Bangladeshi, and Sri Lankans have been apprehended at our borders in fiscal years 2014, 2015, and the first quarter of 2016. This data also shows that individuals have sought to enter the United States illegally from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Turkey, and beyond.    One potential vulnerability that such individuals could attempt to exploit is our Nation's generous asylum system. Aliens making asylum claims after they are apprehended by Border Patrol for entering illegally are being released into American society by the Obama administration.    The number of aliens making credible fear claims has increased exponentially in recent years. According to information provided to the committee by USCIS, the number of credible fear claims increased from 4,995 in fiscal year 2008 to 51,001 in fiscal year 2014, an increase of 921 percent.    Additionally, DHS is approving those claims the vast majority of the time. In fact, the approval rate is 87 percent.    By claiming to have a credible fear, these aliens set in motion a process that can forestall their removal while allowing them to remain in the United States potentially for years. Dangerous individuals such as gang members, cartel operatives, and even supporters and members of terrorist groups, could exploit the system. Such individuals could attempt to enter illegally. And if they successfully evade the Border Patrol, they can remain in the United States. If they get caught, they can make a credible fear claim and likely be released.    During a recent visit by staff to El Paso, Border Patrol and ICE confirmed that they are seeing increased numbers of Bangladeshi, Somalis, Pakistanis, and other nationals of countries of concern coming across the southern border and claiming credible fear.    These anecdotal reports are supported by information that USCIS provided the committee that states that thousands of nationals of these and other countries have claimed credible fear in recent years. For these reasons, Texas DPS has stated that ``an unsecure border with Mexico is the State's most significant vulnerability as it provides criminals and would-be terrorists from around the world a reliable means to enter Texas and the Nation undetected. This is especially concerning today, in light of the recent terrorist attacks and schemes around the world.''    I thank our witnesses for their testimony today and look forward to examining issues related to national security threats at our border and what can be done to combat this growing problem.    I now recognize Mr. Lynch, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on National Security, for his opening statement.    Mr.  DeSantis. I thank the gentleman. I now recognize the chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations, Mr. Meadows, for his opening statement.    Mr.  DeSantis. Without objection.    Mr.  DeSantis. Thank you. I will hold the record open for 5 legislative days for any members who would like to submit a written statement.    We will now recognize our panel of witnesses. I am pleased to welcome Mr. Ronald Vitiello, Acting Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; Mr. Steven McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety; Mr. Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council; Professor Jan Ting, professor at the Temple University Beasley School of Law; and Ms. Eleanor Acer, senior director of refugee protection at Human Rights First. Welcome all.    Pursuant to committee rules, all witnesses will be sworn in before they testify.    If you can please rise and raise your right hand?    Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?    Thank you. Please be seated.    All witnesses answered in the affirmative.    In order to allow time for discussion, please limit your oral testimony to 5 minutes. Your entire written statement will be made part of the record.    Mr. Vitiello, you are up. Five minutes.    Mr.  DeSantis. Thank you.    Mr. McCraw, 5 minutes.                  STATEMENT OF STEVEN C. McCRAW    Mr.  DeSantis. Thank you.    Mr. Judd, 5 minutes.    Mr.  DeSantis. Thank you.    Professor Jan Ting, 5 minutes.    Mr.  DeSantis. Thank you.    Ms. Acer, you are up for 5 minutes.    Mr.  DeSantis. Thank you. The chair now recognizes himself for 5 minutes.    Mr. McCraw, your agency issued a report saying that several Somali immigrants crossing the border who are known members of al-Shabaab have been apprehended, as well as other Somali-based terrorist groups. Can you describe the aliens of special interest that you have seen coming across the border, the threat posed, and how Texas is dealing with that population?    Mr.  DeSantis. Mr. Judd, CBP will often say that since apprehensions are down, the border is more secure. How does that number account for those who the Border Patrol doesn't ever see?    Mr.  DeSantis. We have received reports from Border Patrol agents that sectors and offices reporting lower apprehension numbers are often rewarded, and that apprehensions when they fall between jurisdictions of different offices within a sector, those apprehensions are simply not counted.    Have you heard similar reports suggesting that CBP might be fudging the apprehension data?    Mr.  DeSantis. And I hear some of the witnesses talking about resources, and I agree resources are an issue.    But, Mr. Judd, isn't our functional policy basically catch-and-release at this point? In other words, you can have beefed up Border Patrol, but if people know that if they just get across the border, they are most likely going to be given a citation and be released and then they come back in a year or whatever, to me, that is still going to be a major incentive for people to come in illegally. Am I wrong?    Mr.  DeSantis. Professor Ting, CBP has confirmed that aliens from special interest countries are being apprehended by Border Patrol. USCIS has confirmed that aliens claiming credible fear have been subject to terrorism bars in the INA.    Do you think that the administration's policies regarding aliens who arrive at the border could encourage more nefarious actors to attempt to enter the United States illegally along the Southwest border?    Mr.  DeSantis. So once that word gets out, as you say, basically, if you are somebody who wants to do the United States harm, you can come to the border, claim credible fear, you will likely be released, receive a work permit, and then you will have a court date, what, in a couple years?    Mr.  DeSantis. So do you think if we moved away from some of these loopholes, moved away from a more catch-and-release posture, obviously, people that would come could be apprehended, but then wouldn't that be a deterrent for other people to realize that is probably not the best use of my time and money to try to go across the southern border, if they think there is a probability that the law is actually going to be enforced?    Mr.  DeSantis. Great. My time is expired.    I now recognize the ranking member, Mr. Lynch, for 5 minutes.    Mr.  DeSantis. I thank the gentleman.    The chair now recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Meadows, for 5 minutes.    Mr.  DeSantis. I thank the gentleman.    The chair now recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois for 5 minutes.    Mr.  DeSantis. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Mica, for 5 minutes.    Mr.  DeSantis.
