    Ms. Bass. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    And thank you, Director Comey, for your time and your patience with us today.    I had a townhall meeting in my district on Sunday, and actually a couple hundred people showed up, and it was a general townhall meeting talking about issues that Congress is dealing with, and much to my surprise, this was a burning issue. And many of my constituents came to ask me questions, and I told them that they could suggest some questions and I would ask you. So maybe you could speak to some of my constituents today so I can send them a clip of your testimony.    Basically, in general, they had a hard time believing--I mean, they were not supportive. They don't want, you know, Apple to comply. But they had a hard time believing that the FBI couldn't already do this. And so a couple of the questions were: How have so many others cracked iPhones and shared their findings with videos and how-to articles?    And given that you described it, not as a back door but getting the dogs, you know, away so that you can pick the lock, their question was: What other intelligence community agencies has the FBI worked with, considering there's at least 12 in the government? Between all of these agencies, how is it that you haven't been able to call the dogs off and pick the lock?    Ms. Bass. Right.    Ms. Bass. Since you can clone iPhone contents to compatible hardware and test passwords on the clones without putting the original at risk, can't you use so-called brute force methods to guess the passcode?    Ms. Bass. Thank you. I yield back the balance of my time.
