    Mr. Gibbs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am tempted to yield my time to the ranking member, but I heard the next one is going to do that, so I am trying to understand this issue a little bit.    Mr. Chandler and Mr. Grimm, if a participating community made the choice to drop out of the National Flood Insurance Program, does that change a homebuilder's responsibility under the Endangered Species Act?    Mr. Gibbs. That is what I kind of figured.    Mr. Grimm, in your testimony you mentioned instances in Oregon and Florida where FEMA has had to undertake consultations under the ESA and the implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program. Are you aware of similar issues potentially occurring in Ohio?    Mr. Gibbs. I guess, for the mayor, this RPA and the Endangered Species Act with FEMA, this is where it is all conflicting, the challenges. Can you explain that a little more, what is happening?    Mr. Gibbs. Is this another example of one-size-fits-all policy out of DC?    Mr. Gibbs. Mr. Grimm, do you agree with that, or disagree with her?    Mr. Gibbs. She is talking about, you know, obviously, in the Florida Keys, you want to protect the environment and endangered species, because that is part of your tourism, part of your whole habitat, you know, it is ecosystem. And she has basically said that this is conflicting with the local input, it is a one-size-fits-all policy coming out of DC. I'll just give you a chance to react to that.    Mr. Gibbs. Mr. Grimm, is there anything that Congress should be addressing to maybe help fix this, or help--you know, so it is a little simpler to get the process done?    Mr. Gibbs. Anyone else want to respond to--Ms. Carruthers?    Mr. Gibbs. Yes.    Mr. Gibbs. Thank you. My time has expired.
