    Ms. Smith. Well, thank you. Hi, I am Mary Smith. I am Deputy Director of the Indian Health Service. With respect to, I know it was mentioned the challenges in the Great Plains, so we are certainly addressing immediate things that were cited by CMS, and trying to work to solve the immediate problems. But one of the other things that has kind of been mentioned at this hearing is some of the systemic challenges that we have with staffing, housing, and lack of access to, you know, schools and job opportunities for spouses and things like that.    So we are actually engaging in kind of a strategic framework effort to look at some of these core issues, like staffing, housing, and expanding the use of telemedicine to try to strategically think about these things. We are looking at both short term, intermediate term, and long term, you know, proposals.    Of course we cannot do this without our tribal partners and you all, so we are gathering data. We hope that this will be a data-driven process. And in the very near term we will be reaching out to our tribal partners and you all to start to think through these problems on how we can address them both short term and longer term.    Ms. Smith. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I think we have been working a lot more closely with CMS to try to see if we can think of some creative thing to have like easier eligibility for both programs and working more collaboratively with CMS. So I think we are making strides in that area, and we are going to continue doing that.    Ms. Smith. Yeah.    Ms. Smith. That is an excellent question, and the reason I am sort of happy about the question is that we have had a consolidation, if you will, in Rockville. So SAMHSA now, and we have moved into the 5600 Fishers Lane, and so has SAMHSA. So they are just in the building.
