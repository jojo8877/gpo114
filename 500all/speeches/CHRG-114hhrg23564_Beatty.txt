    Mrs. Beatty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Green.    I am going to be very brief and just make a statement I would like to be entered into the record, and a question. And if appropriate, I would like to yield the balance of my time to the ranking member.    My statement for the record is that in that this is a formal hearing, I would appreciate, as we say ``chairman'' and ``Dr.'' and ``Mr.'' that we make reference to the President of these United States as President Barack Obama in this hearing. That is just my personal statement.    Secondly, my question is yesterday, the Majority released a press release in which I believe the chairman of this subcommittee was quoted as saying that President Barack Obama manufactured a crisis when talking about the consequences of raising the debt limit in 2011.    Dr. Stone, do you believe that the President manufactured a crisis?    Mrs. Beatty. Do you believe that failure to raise the debt limit is an actual crisis?    Mrs. Beatty. Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield the balance of my time to Ranking Member Green.
