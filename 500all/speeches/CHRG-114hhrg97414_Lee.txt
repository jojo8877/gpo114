    Ms.  Lee. Thank you very much.    Good to see you, Mr. Lenhardt, and congratulations once again. And I look forward to working with you on so many issues that are so important to really the survival of many populations of people, children, vulnerable persons, people living with HIV and AIDS, mothers. Your work is so important in terms of the development of not only underdeveloped countries, but just in terms of the development of human beings so that they can live decent, healthy lives. So thank you very much.    A couple of questions that I have quite naturally following up on Mr. Serrano's question as it relates to Cuba, and also the countries that you mentioned where USAID operates in closed societies. I have oftentimes visited countries around the world where people are concerned about USAID workers because they are not sure what they are doing. They are not sure if they are working for the CIA and USAID. And I think this really puts a lot of our staff and contractors at risk, i.e., Alan Gross.    The contract--and we have talked about this--that Alan Gross was working on seemed to be perfectly reasonable, bringing in telecommunications, communications equipment to help set up a communications system where people could communicate with each other. Reasonable.    But I don't believe, because I was very involved in the whole case, that Alan knew that this contract that he was working under and the work that he was conducting was forbidden by law by the host country where he was doing the work, and so we know what happened.    And so I am wondering now, have you had a chance to go back and look--and we raised this before, Congresswoman Lowey and myself, with Mr. Shah--looked at these contracts to see if there are some disclaimers on it that if you are engaged in bringing support to civil society, if you are engaged in these democracy promotion programs that clearly, one, are against the laws of another country, do workers and contractors know that and that they could be subject to arrest? I mean, I think that we have an obligation to let our people know that they could be arrested by doing this work.    And then, third, let me just ask you, as it relates to the countries where USAID is operating, how do we know what countries you are operating in doing this democracy work? Is it clear? Is it public? Are you transparent about that? I mean, I didn't know about the work, I heard about the work in Cuba, but I never could put my hands on it until it was exposed. So how do we know where you are doing this work?    Ms.  Lee. But that is after the fact, Mr. Lenhardt. I am talking about up front.    Ms.  Lee. How do people who willingly do this kind of work know up front that they could be either perceived as a CIA operative or they are working against the laws of the country, I won't even call it the host country, but the country that they are in, that could be perceived as----    Ms.  Lee. But it has in the past. And I am just wondering how we can get the information, this committee, this subcommittee, on where we are operating in this manner and what we are doing.    Ms.  Lee. Okay. But just operating then in closed societies, doing the democracy promotion programs, is there a public list that we could have so we can kind of look at where USAID is doing the type of work that it is doing now in Cuba?    Ms.  Lee. Okay.    Ms.  Lee. Thank you very much.                Ms. Lee. Thank you very much. Good afternoon.    Let me go back to Cuba for a minute, and I wanted to ask our Secretary a couple of things with regard to the upcoming Summit of the Americas.    Now, of course it is no secret that for many, many years I have believed that Americans should have the right to travel to Cuba, I mean, since the 1970s, you know. I just think that this now-50-plus-year policy is what exactly I thought it was then it was going to be, and it is a failed policy. So I am pleased to see the President with his historic announcement and moving toward some semblance of normal relations with an island 90 miles away.    With regard to the seventh Summit of the Americas in Panama City that is taking place next month, I would like to find out--and, Madam Secretary, I know you have led a team to Havana, what, once or twice now--twice--to conduct the negotiations in terms of renormalizing relations. I just need a sense of an update from you with regard to lifting the caps on Cuban and U.S. diplomatic staff and on things like housing for diplomats and travel, and just where are we in terms of those negotiations.    And then, within the context of the summit, how do you see the new move toward normalizing relations impacting the Summit of the Americas?    Ms. Lee. Good. Thank you. And I know many Members of Congress will be attending the summit.    Ms. Lee. Yes. I have heard that several Members were, and some here on this committee would like to attend also.    And let me ask Dr. Hogan a couple of questions about the Caribbean as a region.    So often, the Caribbean has not been put in the proper place, in terms of our policy, in terms of our foreign assistance. And since you have responsibility for the West Indies and Caribbean, could you give us a sense of CARICOM, where we are in terms of our policy in relations and USAID toward CARICOM nations and the West Indies?    Ms. Lee. Could you get to this committee the dollar amount in USAID going to the region, to the Caribbean region, country by country and then a total amount?    Ms. Lee. Because for many years now I have been a bit concerned about our level of USAID and what we are doing. I am glad to hear about the energy initiative. But I travel around the Caribbean, and I have seen the lack of U.S. presence. And I do know China is very active in the Caribbean, and I would like to just see what we are doing as compared to what China is doing.    Thank you.    Ms. Lee. Thanks very much.    Good to see you, Madam Ambassador.    Ambassador Power. Good to see you.    Ms. Lee. Let me just follow up with regard to the discussion you were having with our ranking member and just agree with her that I believe that the two-state solution is the only option that is going to achieve peace and security in the region and, also, for the United States.    I also know--well, let me just say I have legislation, actually, that I have introduced for several years now calling for Congress to go on record supporting a two-state solution and the peace process.    Having said that, I want to make sure we are clear that it is important that both sides, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas, agree that a two-state solution is the ultimate outcome and achievable and what they are seeking, also.    And I know during the last few months, we have had some dialogue back and forth with regard to whether or not Mr. Netanyahu wanted a two-state solution and this process to move forward. So I hope that this chain of events that has taken place since then, that we are back to now agreeing that the Palestinians and the Israelis deserve a two-state solution and that we are going to encourage that to continue.    And I think that the U.N. is going to be very important in your role in that. But I do know we have a little bit of history on what took place as it relates to a concern about whether or not the two-state solution was still a viable option in both parties' policy as well as throughout the region.    Now, let me just thank you for a minute with regard to working with us to secure the contribution for the permanent memorial at the United Nations in honor of the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, which this committee supported. It is really important that the United States and the United Nations represented us at the unveiling on March 25.    So I have to thank you, Ambassador, for that and, also, Ambassador Michele Sison, for ensuring U.S. participation. The African American community is deeply appreciative of the involvement of our country in that transatlantic slave trade memorial.    Boko Haram. You know, this is--1 year now marks the kidnapping of over 200 Nigerian girls. Now, having said that, there are over 800,000 girls that have been abducted from their homes in Nigeria totally. It is very important that the U.N. continue its involvement and the United States.    We supported the U.N. Security Council's resolution calling for adding them to the sanctions list. Congressman Honda and Pittenger and myself, we sent you a letter and we asked that they be included. And you did. And I guess these recent events now have shown us that we have got to do more.    So I am wondering what the United Nations is doing and what we could do to support the international community to address the kidnapping of these young girls and Boko Haram's horrific actions in Nigeria, but now also their connection to ISIS and what you see as the next steps.    Ambassador Power. Thank you, Congresswoman Lee. And thank you for your leadership on the slavery memorial, which is important not only, as you know, in commemorating the horrors of the past, but also because of the very real occurrence of slavery in the present, including, probably, the fate of the girls and how they are living, those that are still in the presence of Boko Haram or being coerced by Boko Haram.    On Boko Haram, in brief, bilaterally, as you know, we right from the beginning offered up intelligence and other assistance--basically, any assistance the Nigerian Government wanted in order to respond to Boko Haram's capture not only of those girls, but, also, Boko Haram's rampage through the northern part of Nigeria.    We have also been very supportive of the regional--the so-called multinational task force that has come into existence now with Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria, trying to actually contest Boko Haram militarily. We recognize that it is not a military solution alone, of course, because the governance issues and the economic deprivation in northern Nigeria is going to need to be addressed over time.    It is similar--you mentioned ISIL. They have, of course, proclaimed allegiance to ISIL. Similar to our anti-ISIL efforts, you need all the different lines of efforts on messaging, on cutting off financing. And, again, there needs to be a military component.    Because of the election in Nigeria, we see ourselves now at a crossroads where this effort can be ramped up significantly. The President-elect Buhari has committed himself. He made this a campaign issue.    And we are hopeful that, with Nigeria determined to tackle, again, the underlying issues in the north, but most specifically to find out where the girls are, not just the 200, but what could be many more than that, and not just girls, but, of course, boys who were pulled out of classrooms and shot in the head just for wanting to learn--Boko Haram meaning education is forbidden--but with Nigeria at the core willing to help resource this with our support bilaterally and for the force itself and with our, again, continued messaging that it needs to be military, but, also, a whole set of other steps to be taken, that we can move into a new phase.    Just recently, in the tail end of the election season in Nigeria, Nigeria began to step up its involvement in the north and Boko Haram is on its heels far more than it has been. But until they are eliminated entirely, no boy, girl, or citizen in that part of Nigeria or now into Chad and Cameroon and Niger is safe.    Ms. Lee. Thank you very much.    Ms. Lee. Thank you very much.    Sudan. I co-chair the bipartisan caucus on Sudan and South Sudan, and we have worked for many, many, many years on a bipartisan basis addressing the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan, which is now deteriorating. According to USAID, more than 1.5 million people have been displaced, 2.5 million people are facing food insecurity in South Sudan since the outbreak of violence in December in 2013.    Now, with the recent collapse in the peace talks, I believe it is very, very critical--and the caucus also believes this--that the U.S. Government increase pressure on the parties to reach a negotiated settlement and to work to bring U.N. sanctions into force.    So, Madam Ambassador, can you tell us what the dynamics are at the United Nations. You mentioned Russia as it relates to sanctions, but we have asked for the establishment of an arms embargo. You know, we can't seem to get that done.    Also, the current U.N. peacekeeping troop levels in South Sudan--want to know, are they being maintained at the current level? What do we need to know from this committee's vantage point that we need to do to make sure those peacekeeping forces are funded?    And then, finally, with regard to U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti, I believe the troop reduction will take place very soon and will pull down to what they were prior to the devastating earthquake in 2010. So what is the timeline of this reduction? And how will this affect the security in Haiti?    Ambassador Power. Thank you.    And let me, if I could, just take this occasion--since we haven't had too much time to talk about our budget request, take advantage of the opening that you have given me to make a fervent appeal that the President's budget requests be fulfilled, in part, because of, well, frankly, the whole host of issues we have discussed up to this point, but because I think what you see with the Haiti drawdown is that we are--and with the drawdown in Liberia that is now recommencing, now that the Ebola crisis has abated, at least in Liberia. Nobody can be overconfident about that, given its presence elsewhere in the neighbors. But you can count on us. We are looking at every mission and seeing where we can recalibrate, right-size.    In the case of Haiti, just to pick up where you ended, Haiti is entering into a process where elections are occurring, but they have also massively increased the capability of the Haitian National Police.    I was down there in January and was told by the U.N. Police Commissioner that it takes 10 international police to do the work of one fully trained Haitian police, which is not normally necessarily the ratio one would expect. But that is a testament to how far they have come, I think, with the U.N.'s help.    I cannot stress how alert we are to the expanding size of the demands that we are making on this committee and on the Congress and the--and the appeal to American taxpayers that I feel I continually have to make, but it is for these causes that are critical to our national security.    And so, if we can draw down in Haiti, right-size--because we don't want to in any way squander the gains that have been made--if we can consolidate in Liberia and in Cote d'Ivoire--we have to increase in South Sudan. It is actually a modest infusion, considering the scale of the threat. We have to fortify the mission in Mali because terrorists are now taking on peacekeepers, and even today we had another incident where there was a suicide attack at a U.N. Base. It is a horrific situation.    But when you go through the list of the peacekeeping missions that we are asking you to help us fund, there is just not one mission that you would take of and say, ``Eh''--you know, even Cyprus, which is the mission that everybody sort of cites, is funded largely not by us, but actually by the parties themselves. And, indeed, of course, given the number of crises in the world, the last thing you would want to do is destabilize something when there is a peace process that we want to ensure reaches results over the long period that that crisis has existed.    But my point is just join us in this--if you could, in this process of looking at these missions. We have cut the per-peacekeeper cost by 18 percent. It can go down more. We are pushing every day on that. We are shrinking the size of missions because we know that there is a certain fluidity where other missions need to be increased. We know there is not an infinite pie here.    But we are carrying over into this year a significant deficit from last year, hopefully, less of one than we thought we were going to be carrying. And, thus, while our appeal looks bigger this year, the actual requirements are just--are a little bit lower even than they were in 2015 for 2016, at least the requirements that we expect.    On South Sudan, just very briefly, as my time is up, we have put in place through this recent Security Council resolution--now you might call it a pressure architecture. So we have a sanctions regime and now we will need to go forward in collaboration with our IGAD friends, who are trying to broker this peace process with designations on those who are spoiling and who are responsible for the breakdown in talks. We have to be strategic about that and think about how to ramp up perhaps or what the right sequencing is.    And the resolution also references an arms embargo, and we are very drawn, as are you, to the idea that, of course, stemming the flow of arms to this region may be another factor that could change the calculus.    But the biggest issue in South Sudan is that the very leaders that this Congress and our administration and our predecessors supported have not put the interests of their people above their own parochial desire for power or for self-preservation. And that is the roadblock that we have to lift, and pressure has got to be part of that.    Ms. Lee. Thank you very much.
