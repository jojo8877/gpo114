    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Administrator, for being here.    One of the risks of being a freshman is I am right down here in the line of fire with you. I just had one question, in light of the Chairman's wanting to get to the other people who have been so patiently waiting here.    Certainly, this is an unfortunate incident, one that we must do all we can to prevent from happening again. We need to learn from this. But also, the word ``accountability'' has been thrown around a lot this morning. You have said as much yourself, that you will follow this wherever it goes, and I appreciate that.    Could you tell me how do you define the ``accountability'' here? What would that look like in the end?    Mr. Newhouse. Well, I can say, having run an agency myself in a former life, that I believe the ability of the Agency, and the credibility of the Agency, its ability to perform its duties, is truly on the line here. It is as much at risk as anything else. So, I would hope that we can take you at your word that the accountability aspect of this will be followed to wherever it goes, and that we are satisfied that the people that are in charge are held accountable.    Mr. Newhouse. Could you tell me a little bit about the protocol when the spill happened? Could you talk about what the Agency's first actions were? What are the protocols for this kind of a spill?    Mr. Newhouse. Can you say whether or not these protocols were all followed? And were there any, just as importantly, that were not followed as well as they should have been?    Mr. Newhouse. Hindsight, I know, is 20/20.    Mr. Newhouse. I would agree with that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.    The Chairman. We now have three other Members who are not a part of our committees who are here to ask questions.    Mr. Pearce, we will start with you.
