    Dr. Bohman. The Economic Research Service, has long played an important role in USDA's commodity outlook program. It is over 50 years at this point, and our expertise is to bring in the economic knowledge. We are all economists, how the markets work. We also have research behind the economists to participate in these committees, and we have data systems that are used to produce supply, demand, and utilization tables.    So we are some of the sort of intellectual horsepower behind the committees and draws on our infrastructure. After the WASDE report comes out every month, ERS produces newsletters for the major commodities that show the reasoning behind the WASDE estimates, and this is a unique contribution.    A final element that we produce is a periodic report such as on China's cotton stocks, U.S. trade with Cuba, or the implications of lower energy prices for the farm sector which document the modeling and economic logic behind the WASDE reports.    Another contribution ERS makes is leading USDA's 10 year agriculture baseline. We really drive that process in collaboration with the Office of the Chief Economist.    Dr. Bohman. We are committed to continuing excellence in this area.    Dr. Bohman. Well, ERS analysts bring to the table, along with analysts from the Farm Service Agency, from NASS, from the World Board itself, a process where they have data from the past, they have the NASS statistics that are about to be released, and they also have expertise from talking to other people in the industry.    So they bring the best knowledge to produce these forecasts. They regularly go back and check the accuracy of their forecast, the ones that are predicting, how do they do when the market clears in the future, and so there is a robust system of checks and balances, but I will turn to my NASS colleague because they are a big part of the process.
