    Mr. Clawson. Thank you for coming today and sharing your personal stories.    Mr. Asmussen, I remember the sadness in my father's eyes when the murders took place in Denmark. Clawson is Danish. My forefathers come from about an hour south of Copenhagen in Borse in Zealand. My dad has taken me there. My father speaks Danish. And so it hit home to us personally and I will always remember his face when it happened. And he has told me he was glad his father wasn't here. So your words hit home and if there is anything that I can ever do, and I am sure my colleagues can ever do, to influence this in a positive way I am innately motivated to do so and see the innate unjustness of what is going on with the Jewish community in Europe.    I think of your question or your comment that the solution must come from within the Muslim community. That feels hopeful to me, but it also feels like we have to prepare for the fact that that might not happen. And if so, my question for the three of you then becomes what do we do next? What do we do now? Thank you.
