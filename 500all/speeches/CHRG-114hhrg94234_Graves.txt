    Mr. Graves. Real quickly. And Admiral Manazir, you talked about the shortfall. And I am very concerned about this. When we have fewer airframes out there to do the job, we put a lot of operational fatigue on those airplanes. And you talked about this.    And just for the record again, and so I can start working to rectify this, how many airplanes do you need, how many Super Hornets do you need to eliminate that shortfall? How many do you need to procure?    Mr. Graves. Thank you very much.
