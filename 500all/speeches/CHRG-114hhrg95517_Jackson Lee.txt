    Ms. Jackson Lee. Mr. Chairman, let me thank you, and to the chairman of the full committee, ranking member, and all of the witnesses, I will take just a moment to say that I am committed to this issue with every ounce of my abilities. I have been appalled at some of the stories, even in spite of this bill that we worked so hard to pass.    And I think this hearing with Chairman Smith, who has listened to stories along with me, and let me welcome Ms. Rutherford and the other witnesses who have painfully indicated, that this is not about paper or legislative proudness or the fact that a good bill is trying to do a good thing. It is about the passion and love that a parent has for their children and one where they deserve to be able to express that love and affection.    I would just yield back, Mr. Chairman, and say that however we can make the effective tool that the State Department uses to be an effective tool, I think that is what our challenge should be. American citizens should be able to look to their government for relief, even in spite of some of the unusual procedures of our foreign neighbors.    And, with that, let me yield back and commit myself to working on this issue continuously.    Thank you.
