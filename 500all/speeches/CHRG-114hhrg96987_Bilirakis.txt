    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the panel's testimony today as well. One of my greatest concerns with this transition is the susceptibility of the ICANN to manipulation by foreign governments. Mr. DelBianco, how will stakeholders protect the process from foreign governments if they continue a push for power or unjust control once the United States withdraws its stewardship role?    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you, Mr. DelBianco. Got it right that time. Next question, a number of U.S. companies, including yours, Ms. Plonk, have expressed support for this transition----    Mr. Bilirakis. What about congressional----    Mr. Bilirakis . Oversight?    Mr. Bilirakis. Anyone else want to comment on that?    Mr. Bilirakis. Yes.    Mr. Bilirakis. OK. Thank you.    Mr. Bilirakis. Mister----    Mr. Bilirakis. Right. Thank you very much. Mr. Shears, in the past some have argued that, through relinquishing or contractual relationship with ICANN, accountability might suffer in the transition. In your testimony you mentioned the current hybrid proposal separating functions and oversight. You conclude by saying this can work only if ICANN is held accountable to its own internal governance structures, and stressed the multi-stakeholder community needs to be more empowered than it is today for it all to work. Can you elaborate on this, and if you expect this approach to ensure accountability will be successful?
