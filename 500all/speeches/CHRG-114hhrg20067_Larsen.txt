    Mr. Larsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Secretary, I think you have an obligation, certainly a right, to respond to something that former Deputy Director of CIA said yesterday in response to a question. He said that ISIL is winning, and he said based on two assessments: one, although there is less caliphate territory, they seem to be spreading their influence beyond the caliphate territory; and then, of course, in direct reference to the attacks in Brussels.    So I wanted to get your assessment about whether you think ISIL is winning, and if not, your assessment of the former Deputy Director of CIA's comments.    Mr. Larsen. I am going to move to the budget and talk about taking the long view.    Unfortunately for you, you don't get to be here for the implementation of the long view and to help us deal with the actual long view. And we have been having this debate a little bit, and Mrs. Davis touched upon it. And I am just wondering how you envision affording these incredibly expensive programs that we have outside, not just outside of this budget but outside of the 5 years and even 10. Nuclear modernization is one of those, but it is not the only one where we are going to be called upon, if we have the fortunate success of staying here, to resolve and solve.    Mr. Larsen. That is fine. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I yield back.    The Chairman. Mr. Forbes.
