    Mr. Griffith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Let me try to get some blanks filled in here. I don't have the answers. The meeting took place with WHO in CDC and FDA and others in February. In March, we know that there was a drift that was picked up of about 10 percent, is that correct?    Mr. Griffith. About 7 percent I think I saw in your testimony.    Mr. Griffith. OK. Do we know what April was, because we have a few numbers on the chart but we have a lot of question marks? And if you don't----    Mr. Griffith . You can provide it----    Mr. Griffith. OK. And then we have a number from May. Then June and July, we don't have another number on this chart until September. What were you all seeing in June, July and August?    Mr. Griffith. OK.    Mr. Griffith. And then there is another meeting, and there is a different Southern Hemisphere recommendation made, and we don't make the--I think that is five. If you can get us the other numbers just so we can kind of track it, that would be great. But then----    Mr. Griffith . My question comes up, and I am happy for anybody to answer it, why didn't we have the manufacturing capacity for the virus to do turn somewhere in this process, I think you said by June, July, we were in the 36 percent range, recognizing that flu season doesn't generally hit in a big way for another fair number of months, why does the United States lack that manufacturing capacity, and as a subpart of that, if there was the capability of producing, and I am trying to pronounce this correctly, monovalent vaccine, why didn't we do so? And if you all could focus on that. Any member of the panel please.    Mr. Griffith. Dr. Robinson?    Mr. Griffith. OK. Let me----    Mr. Griffith. Let me ask the why on that. Is it because there is not a profit----    Mr. Griffith . To be made?    Mr. Griffith. OK.    Mr. Griffith. So you anticipate that our capacity will be greater in the next couple of years than it is today to react?    Mr. Griffith. But if we----    Mr. Griffith. But we could have done that even in, say, July when we knew we were at 36 percent that had drifted?    Mr. Griffith. OK. All right. I appreciate it. I see my time is up and yield back.
