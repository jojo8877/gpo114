    Mr. Marino. The Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare recesses of the Committee at any time.    We welcome everyone to today's hearing on H.R. 2745, the ``Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015.'' I will recognize myself for an opening statement.    Today's hearing is on the ``Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015,'' known as the ``SMARTER Act.'' This legislation enacts an Antitrust Modernization Commission recommendation that the standards and processes applied in the merger review process should be identical between our two antitrust enforcement agencies.    Since 1914, two Federal agencies have enforced our Nation's antitrust laws, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. When a company wishes to merge with or purchase another company, it notifies both antitrust enforcement agencies of the proposed transaction. Ultimately, only one agency reviews the transaction to determine whether it violates the antitrust laws, and there is no fixed rule to determine which agency will conduct this review.    When the reviewing antitrust enforcement agency concludes that the proposed transaction violates the antitrust laws, it then seeks to prevent the parties from consummating the deal. It is at this stage of the merger review process that the AMC identified a problem.    The AMC noted that there are different standards applied and processes available to the FTC and DOJ when each agency seeks to block a proposed transaction. Each agency is subject to a different preliminary injunction standard.    Additionally, the FTC has the option to unwind or prevent the closing of the transaction through administrative litigation, DOJ on the other hand cannot.    The AMC concluded that, although certain of the differences between the FTC and DOJ may have some benefits, the disparities between the dual merger review processes result in unfairness and uncertainty. In light of this finding, the AMC recommended that Congress harmonize the merger review processes and standards between the two antitrust enforcement agencies.    The SMARTER Act effectuates this recommendation. This legislation was carefully drafted to reform only the merger review process. The SMARTER Act does not prevent the FTC from pursuing administrative litigation in conduct cases, against consummated transactions, or in any other context outside of the merger review. This narrow construction is consistent with the AMC's recommendations.    Our witnesses today come with experience in the FTC, the DOJ, the AMC, and in private practice. I look forward to hearing their testimony on the important reforms contained in the SMARTER Act.    Mr. Marino. And I now recognize the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, for his opening statement.    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Mr. Johnson.    The Chair now recognizes the Chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, Mr. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, for his opening statement.    Mr. Marino.

Before joining Covington, Ms. Garza served as acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice.    Ms. Garza also was appointed by President George W. Bush to chair the Antitrust Modernization Commission, a bipartisan, blue-ribbon panel created by Congress to study and report to the President and Congress on the state of antitrust enforcement in the United States. The AMC report has been widely praised for providing a valuable framework for policy proposals.    Ms. Garza received her B.S. from Northern Illinois University and her J.D. from the University of Chicago.    Welcome, Ms. Garza.    Mr. Clanton as the senior counsel at Baker & McKenzie, where he also served as head of the firm's global and North American antitrust practice groups. Mr. Clanton has over 30 years of experience representing clients in high-profile and complex antitrust matters. Prior to joining the law firm, Mr. Clanton served as a commissioner and acting chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.    Mr. Clanton received his B.A. from Andrews University and his J.D. from Wayne Law School, where he served on law review.    Welcome, Mr. Clanton.    Mr. Tad Lipsky is a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of Latham & Watkins. He is recognized internationally for his work on both U.S. and global antitrust law and policy, and has handled antitrust matters throughout the world.    Before Latham & Watkins, Mr. Lipsky served as the chief antitrust lawyer for the Coca-Cola Company for 10 years. Mr. Lipsky also served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General under William F. Baxter, who sparked profound antitrust law changes while serving as President Reagan's Chief Antitrust Official.    Mr. Lipsky received his B.A. from Amherst College, his M.A. from Stanford University, and his J.D. from Stanford Law School.    Welcome, sir.    Our final witness is Mr. Bert Foer, the founder and former president of the American Antitrust Institute. Prior to founding AAI, Mr. Foer served in both private and public capacities in the antitrust field. His public service includes serving as the Assistant Director and Acting Deputy Director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition. His private sector experience includes working at Hogan & Hartson, serving as the CEO of a midsize chain of retail jewelry stores, working in various trade associations and nonprofit leadership positions, and teaching antitrust to undergraduate and graduate business school students.    Mr. Foer received his B.A. magna cum laude from Brandeis University, and M.A. in political science from Washington University, and his J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School where he was an associate law review editor.    Welcome, sir.    Each of the witnesses' written statements will be entered into the record in its entirety. I ask that each witness summarize his or her testimony in 5 minutes or less. And to help you with that, you have timing lights in front of you. A light will switch from green to yellow, indicating that you have 1 minute to conclude your testimony. And when the light turns red, it indicates that the witness's 5 minutes have expired. When it gets to the point of when the light flashes red, I know you are intent on getting in your statement, I will politely pick up my hammer and just give you a little indication to please wrap up.    Ms. Garza, your 5-minute opening statement, please?    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Ms. Garza.    Mr. Clanton?                          McKENZIE LLP    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Mr. Clanton.    Mr. Lipsky, your statement, please?    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Mr. Lipsky.        Mr. Foer, your statement, please?    Mr. Marino. Thank you, sir.    We begin now with our questioning for 5 minutes. I am going to ask each of the Members to keep their questions to 5 minutes.    Please bear in mind that we like to get to ask each of you a question, so keep your answers as succinct as possible.    I am going to begin with Ms. Garza, please. Ms. Garza, some suggest that the SMARTER Act will make merger enforcement more difficult for the FTC. Do you think DOJ is effective at preventing anticompetitive transactions? And is there any reason to think that the FTC cannot be equally as effective operating under the same rules?    Mr. Marino. Thank you.    Mr. Clanton, the FTC recently reinstated the Pitofsky rule that purports to create a higher threshold for proceeding with administrative litigation against a proposed transaction.    Do you believe this rule is sufficient on its own, or is the SMARTER Act still necessary?    Mr. Marino. Thank you, sir.    Mr. Lipsky, in your testimony you discussed two cases where the FTC pursued administrative litigation after a Federal court ruling. In one case, the FTC continued administrative litigation for nearly 6 years after a Federal court denied its preliminary injunction request. In the other, the FTC continued administrative litigation after they had won in Federal court and the parties abandoned the transaction.    Would these administrative litigation cases have been allowed to continue if the SMARTER Act was enacted into law?    Mr. Marino. Mr. Foer, in 20 seconds, why should some companies be subject to FTC standards and processes and others to DOJ standards and processes? Does having different standards and processes result in fair and consistent enforcement for our antitrust laws?    Mr. Marino. Having different standards and processes, is that fair and consistent?    Mr. Marino. Thank you, sir.    The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member, the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Johnson.    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Mr. Johnson.    The Chair now recognizes the other gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Collins.    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Mr. Collins.    The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member of the full Committee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Conyers.    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Mr. Conyers.    The Chair now recognizes the Congresswoman from the State of Washington, Ms. DelBene.    Mr. Marino. Thank you, Ms. DelBene.    Seeing no other Members to ask questions, and I am told that we are going to be voting within the next 10 or 15 minutes, this concludes today's hearing.    I want to thank the witnesses for attending. It was very insightful and pleasant to hear a discussion from four lawyers who are very, very well-qualified and just brilliant in their field. So I want to thank you all for being here.    Without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record.    I want to thank the people in the gallery for being here, and this hearing is adjourned.
