    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's interesting talking about flying out when we're dealing with railroads. So we'll try to fly a little lower at this point.    But thanks for having this hearing. Railroads are important to our economy. Railroads do carry things that we can't do as efficiently otherwise. And there are plenty of dedicated people, some you've mentioned from your families, involved. But that requires that we be more effective in making sure that every system works and everyone is involved in doing it the proper way.    Mr. Dickman, did the OIG recommend that the RRB attempt to recover the payments that were deemed improper after the Long Island Rail Road fraud?    Mr. Walberg. So your counsel was temporary, waiting for the process to develop?    Mr. Walberg. Based upon determining the necessity for prosecution and the evidence.    Mr. Walberg. Then I would follow that up, Chairman Schwartz, why did the RRB choose to abandon the option to recover 275--as I understand it--$275 million in improper payments following exposure of the Long Island fraud ring?    Mr. Walberg. Let me go back.    Mr. Dickman, in looking at all of that information, what was just said, do you agree with that?    Mr. Walberg. Why?    Mr. Walberg. Looks like a coverup?    Mr. Walberg. It doesn't sound like it. When we see the type of fraud that went on and the percentage of people who were involved in that situation who were reinStated and have received the final, final verdict that they were worthy of receiving those retirement benefits and those disability benefits, that doesn't seem like you're working with it.    I know my time has expired. Hopefully, we will continue. And I yield back.
