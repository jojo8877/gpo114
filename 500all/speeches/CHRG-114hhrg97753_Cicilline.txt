    Mr. Cicilline. Thank you, Madam Chairman.    Thank you, Madam Chairman and Ranking Member Deutch for convening this very important hearing relating to U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. Over the previous 14 years, the U.S. has spent an estimated $1 trillion and lost more than 2,300 American lives in Afghanistan. Military gains by the Taliban and the growing presence of groups like Daesh, as well as a growing number of loosely aligned armed groups provide grave uncertainty regarding Afghanistan's security and stability. It also reveals tremendous challenges and even uncertainty about what role we can effectively play in resolving these conflicts.    The President's recent shift in strategy will leave a significant number of American forces in Afghanistan beyond 2016, creating an unclear future regarding our presence in the region and when it will finally conclude.    I look forward to hearing the perspective of today's witnesses who will help provide an assessment of the President's strategy in Afghanistan and its impact on our overall national security. And with that I yield back.
