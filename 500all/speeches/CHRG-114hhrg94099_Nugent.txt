    Mr. Nugent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I appreciate this panel being here today.    You know one of the things that I always get nervous about when I was over an agency that had computers and every time you have a gateway, a way in, how that opens up. But it is even more troubling as to when you look back at the Snowden incident 2 years ago.    How are we protecting ourselves against an insider attack that could obviously cripple us if that information got out to our adversaries? And I will let anyone take a stab at that one.    Mr. Nugent. I know there was a GAO report out a while back, particularly as it relates to DISA, but as it relates to JIE that it is so broad that there is no one program administrator. Were they correct in that assumption? Or was----    Mr. Nugent. All right. It makes sense because obviously if you have one agency or one group that is in charge of all of the IT for all the services there are some real gaps that would occur. Things the Air Force would be important to would not be as important to the Army or vice versa.    So I think that your concept is great. And I think that you have--through the services you have some great folks that are very talented that can move this forward.    You know IT is always something changing. I can remember my past life it always seemed like you know we just upgraded our servers and then it wasn't 2 years later saying hey, boss, the stuff is no good. We got to get new stuff.    And I am sure you face that same type of environment. But how do you guard against that, I mean constant change over what you need, equipment? And I don't know if you can.    Mr. Nugent. I appreciate that.    And, Chairman, thank you for indulging me----    Mr. Nugent. Thank you.
