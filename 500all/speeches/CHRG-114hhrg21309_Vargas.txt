    Mr. Vargas. The only comment I would make is to thank the Capitol Police. I have had such great service here. I really appreciate the work that they do, and I hope that you take that back to them. Thank you.    The Chairman. Thank you.    I move the Committee favorably report this bill to the House. The question is on the motion.    All in favor, signify by saying aye.    Opposed, say nay.    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, the ayes have it. The motion is agreed to. Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.    I now call before the Committee our next agenda item, H.R. 5227, the Library of Congress Modernization Act of 2016.    Without objection, the first reading of the bill is dispensed with, and the bill is considered read and open for amendment at any point.
