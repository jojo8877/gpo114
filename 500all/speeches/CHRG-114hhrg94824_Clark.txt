    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to all the witnesses who are here today.    My oldest son graduated from high school last Friday. And as I looked out on that stage with incredible pride as a mom, but also wondering about the future for these high school grads and the college graduations that I attended in my district, as well.    I would describe my home state of Massachusetts as a right-to-a-fair-shot state. We are a proud union state. We protect collective bargaining. And I looked at these high school seniors graduating, going off to make their world in the workplace or at college. And I thought about what they are facing; rise of income inequality, a rise of child poverty, and also a rise of corporate influence and power. Not only in the board rooms, but in the political process, as well. And I have to say that I believe this right-to-work is an incredible misnomer.    But my question is for Dr. Bruno and Dr. Gould, what do you see the impact for these young people, for the people that we are trying to attract? And, by the way, I have never talked to a business that is thinking of leaving Massachusetts who has ever cited unions as a problem. High cost of housing, high cost of electricity, those are issues that we need to address. It is not unionization--that is making us a better and wealthier communities--that is ever cited as an issue.    But how do you see these issues around health insurance coverage, pensions, and wages affecting our most recent graduates?    Ms. Clark. Thank you.    I yield back.
