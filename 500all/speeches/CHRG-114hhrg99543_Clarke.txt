    Ms. CLARKE. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank our ranking member. I would also like to thank our distinguished witness, The Honorable Peggy Gustafson.    Ms. CLARKE. Ms. Gustafson, is it imperative that the Small Business Administration accurately report the contracts awarded to small businesses? I am raising this because I think it is impossible to know where to focus our efforts in meeting small business contracting goals when we are possibly dealing with inaccurate procurement data. Can you speak about how the SBA plans to mitigate this issue of inaccuracy in goaling data?    Ms. CLARKE. Very well. I hope that you will continue to encourage them to sort of drill down.    Ms. CLARKE. As we will as well.    As you are aware, collaboration between the SBA and other Federal agencies is so critical to the mission that small businesses can fairly compete for Federal contracts. How can the SBA improve its collaboration with other Federal agencies so that small businesses are treated fairly in contracting practice? Which steps are the SBA already taking to do so?    Ms. CLARKE. I thank you for your answers this morning, and I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
