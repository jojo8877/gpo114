    Mr. Jeffries. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I want to thank the witnesses for your presence here today. And if I could just start with Mr. Meyer, and perhaps we can take a macroeconomic approach to the economic situation that we find ourselves in today. Is it your view that regulations that have been put forth under this Administration have stifled economic growth in America?    Mr. Jeffries. Now, we are in a period of unprecedented economic growth, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Seventy-one consecutive months of private sector job creation is impressive, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Fourteen million jobs created under this Administration is impressive, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Over the last 7 years, the unemployment rate has gone from over 10 percent to under 5 percent, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. I said, over the last 7 years, the unemployment rate has gone from over 10 percent to under 5 percent. Is that correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Teenagers who would otherwise be in high school or college?    Mr. Jeffries. I certainly think it is the case that we need to do more. I just want to make sure that the record is clear as it relates to the progress that has already been made over the last 7 years.    Now, you testified, I believe, that the length of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulation is preventing millennial entrepreneurship because, I want to get the quote right, ``attempting to comprehend which of these million-plus restrictions apply to their businesses is a waste of young entrepreneurs' valuable time.'' Is that right?    Mr. Jeffries. Now, there are a whole host of other factors that limit the ability of millennials to pursue entrepreneurial activities, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Now, let's focus in on what I think is the predominant problem that we have got in America. Student loan debt is now $1.3 trillion, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. That is an unprecedented number in American history, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. And that level of student loan debt, which is strangling young people, limits their ability to purchase a home earlier than or along the same timeframe as prior generations. True?    Mr. Jeffries. And it may even limit their ability to get married, start a family consistent with the timeframe of prior generations, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. And would you not also agree that that $1.3 trillion number is probably the predominant factor in limiting millennials from taking an entrepreneurial risk because of the need to consistently pay off student loan debt on a month-by-month basis?    Mr. Jeffries. I appreciate that. I have got limited time, so----    Mr. Jeffries . If I can just get one or two questions in.    Mr. Jeffries. But I do really appreciate your thoughtful responses. Now, Facebook is a successful company, true?    Mr. Jeffries. And that was founded by millennials, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Twitter is a successful company, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Started by millennials. True?    Mr. Jeffries. Snapchat is a successful company?    Mr. Jeffries. Started by millennials, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Okay. Uber is a pretty successful company. True?    Mr. Jeffries. Started by millennials, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Okay. Yelp is a successful company, correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Yelp.    Mr. Jeffries. Started by millennials?    Mr. Jeffries. Okay. No further questions. I yield back.
