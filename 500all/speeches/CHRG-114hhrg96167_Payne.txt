    Mr. Payne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the Ranking Member of this committee. Mr. Roth, a bit of a kind-of confusing element in your most recent report is how TSA's vetting process can be considered generally effective, yet 73 individuals with links to terrorism were not found during this process. It seems a little contradictory. Can you elaborate?    Mr. Payne. So basically with the volume, if it was other than an issue of terrorism, it would be considered not that bad. But, you know, the potential of 73 individuals, you only need one to have ill will against this country.    Mr. Payne. Your report acknowledges passport numbers and Social Security numbers being strong matching elements, yet neither is required during the application process. In your view, can TSA effectively identify potential risk if such elements are discounted?    Mr. Payne. Okay. Ms. Fitzmaurice, during the Q and A with the Members up here, what leverage do we have with the airport operators if they are not complying and giving the information? You know, I believe you said that there is a lapse sometimes with the airport operators in doing that job. What leverage do we have to make sure that they are complying?    Mr. Payne. What would those corrective actions consist of? If we are having, you know, obviously continued issues around them getting to where we need them to be, what, what leverage do we have if they are falling short?    Mr. Payne. Okay. Well, what can we do to strengthen the relationship TSA has with the airports to ensure accuracy of the data from potential and current aviation workers?    Mr. Payne. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
