    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, witnesses, for joining us today.    Sitting on this committee, I realize just what an increasingly-complex world in which we live, but how interdependent we are with our global neighbors, how we look forward to working to promote peace, security, economic growth, development.    With India especially, representing such a huge population, proportion of the world's population, I want to know how we can both influence and effectively advance both our national interest and at the same time do that in a way that improves our relationships. You know, there are many challenges in front of us in the world, on this globe, and this committee sees them all. But I want to hear how we can in this committee and Congress support better relationships with India, how we can support their economic development, their democratic aspirations, and not just of India, but really the democratic aspirations of the entire region and how we can work together for that.    And I yield back.    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    I am going to follow up some of the questions I thought in terms of India's relationships to its neighbors per se. Can you tell us how it is improving trade or what its trade relationships are with Pakistan, with China, with Sri Lanka? Where is that moving? And maybe explain to us how India is dealing with its regional partners.    Mr. Lowenthal. Yes.    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you.    I just have one other question. You have all touched on it. I think, Dr. Ayres, you talked about it also, about some of the legal protections, or lack thereof, in India. I am just wondering, is the legal system or the rule of law attractive enough for foreign investment into India now? Do companies believe that they have the kinds of legal protections that they need? Anyone?    Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you.    And I yield back.
