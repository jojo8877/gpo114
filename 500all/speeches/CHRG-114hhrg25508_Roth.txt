    Mr. Roth. Sure. What we have done is two things. One is the natural follow-up that we would do in any audit. So, for example, with regard to the penetration testing, we have reviewed TSA's 22-point plan to increase security at the checkpoint. Additionally, we are planning more covert testing the summer of a similar scale that we did last summer so we'll be able to tell exactly how we're doing.    Mr. Connelly.--according to this report. One final question if the chair will indulge me, just a real quick one.    Inspector General Roth, do we have an anonymous hotline within TSA that people can call when they feel something is untoward, sort of under the broader whistleblower category? But, I mean, you know, in my county there is a hotline you can call if you think someone is doing something untoward, and you are protected with anonymity and it is followed up by our inspector general.    Mr. Roth. Yes, absolutely. We have a hotline that is manned, as well as a Web site so you can use either of those ways to complain or give us information that we will eventually ----    Mr. Roth. We will take a look at it. We get 18,000 complaints a year. We can't guarantee that every single one of those complaints will be thoroughly investigated, but we certainly look at them and evaluate them.    Mr. Roth. As we looked at our report, I mean, it was clearly an attempt to circumvent the departmental regulations on approval, so ----    Mr. Roth. The individual responsible for that, by the time that we did our investigation, was no longer employed at TSA, and the regulations that existed at the time were so loose that it was technically permissible even though clearly the intent was, I think, wrong.    Mr. Roth. Absolutely.    Mr. Roth. Yes, sir.    Mr. Roth. Yes, ma'am.    Mr. Roth. Yes, ma'am.    Mr. Roth. Yes, ma'am, we did. We made five different recommendations. TSA agreed with each of those recommendations, and we're in the process of doing an audit follow-up to ensure that in fact TSA is doing what they said that they would do.    Mr. Roth. Thank you.    Mr. Roth. We have not looked at that issue. My understanding is that GAO may have done some work on that, but we have not.    Mr. Roth. I do not. I don't have any evidence that I could share at least today.    Mr. Roth. I don't, no, Congressman.    Mr. Roth. No, just what was in our investigation, which was that the policy was very sort of loose, but we had a commitment from TSA that they would fix the policy. My understanding is they have.    Mr. Roth. Just the size of the enterprise, 2 million passengers a day, 450 airports, TSA as the checkpoint operator but also TSA as the regulator of the airports, it's a monumental task that's going to take time to fix.
