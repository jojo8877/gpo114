    Mr. Takano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    My question, Dr. Bruno or Dr. Gould, are either of you familiar with the role of training, the amount of training that unions provide to workers, especially in the building trades? I myself have visited the carpenter's union training facilities, and they are quite impressive.    Is there any other entity that--for workers, especially in the construction trades, that finances that level of training?    Mr. Takano. I have seen that some nonunion organizations who oppose, say, project labor agreements at a local level have said that, you know, that they provide that training as well, or that these local agreements discriminate against their workers in terms of their training. I find that to be kind of a specious claim.    Mr. Takano. So at least within this industry that I am--    Mr. Takano. So my time is--so it is a bit hollow to sort of lay the blame at labor, I would say.    Mr. Takano. And Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
