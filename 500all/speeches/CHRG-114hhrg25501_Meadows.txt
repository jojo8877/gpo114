    Mr. Meadows. I take exception to that, Mr. Hurd.    Mr. Meadows. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Harris, let me come to your opening statement. In your opening statement, and I quote, ``Others viewed my conduct as questionable.'' So I guess the fundamental question here today is if others viewed it, did you view your conduct as questionable?    Mr. Meadows. So your action is questionable.    Mr. Meadows. All right.    Mr. Meadows. All right. So, Ms. Winchell, I would believe that you take ethics pretty seriously given your job, is that correct?    Mr. Meadows. So when you hear a complaint, you get on it right away, is that correct?    Mr. Meadows. And so no time lapses between when you hear about it and you work towards remedy?    Mr. Meadows. Okay.    Ms. Winchell.--we would try to do that as swiftly as possible.    Mr. Meadows. Sure. Mr. King, is that your testimony as well, you take it real serious?    Mr. Meadows. Okay. Can either of you, Ms. Winchell or Mr. King, explain to me why the inspector general gave you a report on April of 2013 and they had to do a follow-up 2 years later and said that they had never heard from anybody? Why would that be?    Mr. King, you may want to answer since it was directed to you on March 23 of 2015. In response it says, ``To date, we have not received a response from the Office of the Deputy Secretary concerning the findings that they gave on April 2 of 2013.'' Why would they have not had response in 2 years ----    Mr. Meadows. But that is not what this is saying. I am going back to the original report when they put in the report on April 2 of 2013. You know what they heard from you guys? Crickets, not a single dadgum response.    Ms. Winchell, you want to respond to that?    Mr. Meadows. How did you figure that out?    Mr. Meadows. Who talked to Dr. Harris?    Mr. Meadows. Because you didn't talk to him, according to your note ----    Mr. Meadows. How did you ----    Ms. Winchell.--fall of ----    Mr. Meadows. How did you understand that?    Mr. Meadows. Did you go and talk to Dr. Harris?    Mr. Meadows. Well, now ----    Mr. Meadows. And they were waiting for a response ----    Mr. Meadows. So ----    Mr. Meadows. So you are in charge of ethics ----    Mr. Meadows. And said it was okay?    Mr. Meadows. Now, how is that your understanding? Did you talk to Tony Miller about that?    Mr. Meadows. Okay. Well ----    Mr. King.--overlapped between Deputy Secretary Miller and ----    Mr. Meadows. Mr. King, let me tell you what is troubling here. I don't know if Dr. Harris's actions are the most troubling or your cover-up of it is the most troubling, Mr. King, because let me tell you the concern I have. Everybody can make a mistake, but the minute that it was put forth by the IG, everybody, Ms. Winchell and Mr. King, you should have been all over this and saying that this is a problem.    And let me tell you the reason why I am so concerned. I have been visiting Federal employees, and you know what I constantly hear is that there is a double standard for the people at the top and the rank-and-file Federal workers. And today, listening to this testimony, I tell you, I hope they are not watching because they would use a different word for a bovine waste than what is used here.    Mr. Meadows. No, you haven't because your responses ----    Mr. Meadows. What are the consequences?    Mr. Meadows. Okay. So his ----    Mr. Meadows. And how do you know that?    Mr. Meadows. But how do you know that?    Mr. Meadows. But the IG said ----    Mr. Meadows. Everybody else is very clear.    I yield back.    Mr. Meadows. Mr. King, so let me make sure I am clear. Your testimony here today is that there has been no ethical breach by Dr. Harris? That is your testimony?    Mr. Meadows. Yes, you keep going back to that. Is that what the general counsel told you to respond every time you were asked a direct question is to respond with that? Is that what your counsel ----    Mr. Meadows. So there is no ethical challenge?    Mr. Meadows. Okay.    Mr. King.--or policy of the Department.    Mr. Meadows. If that is the case, I have got good news for you, Mr. Harris. You can go back to doing whatever you darn well please because what he is saying is there is no violation.    Mr. Meadows. No, that is what you are saying.    Mr. Meadows. That is a circular reasoning.    Mr. King.--is that--no. It's ----    Mr. Meadows. You are saying it is not. Why did you stop, Dr. Harris? If there was no violation of ethical standards, why did you stop?    Mr. Meadows. All right. So let me ask you this, Mr. King. Why did three different Secretaries counsel Dr. Harris? If the first one took, why was there a need for a counseling of the second one? Why is there a need for the third one?    Mr. Meadows. If it was done on 2013 according to your testimony, everything was over, why did everybody keep following up with Dr. Harris? If there is no violation of ethics or anything else, why would you have embarked to counsel him again?    Mr. Meadows. So why did you waste your time?    Mr. Meadows. So he did violate ethical standards?    Mr. King.--also the importance--and wanted--no, and wanted to convey, wanted to convey ----    Mr. Meadows. You can't have it both ways, Mr. King. You can't have it both ways.    Mr. Meadows. Let me tell you what you are conveying ----    Mr. Meadows. Okay. If the IG said it was a business, which she did, why did you not go by that? You questioned it there.    Mr. Meadows. I have read it.    Mr. Meadows. And I am telling you she said it--your testimony, Ms. Bruce, was it a business?    Mr. Meadows. It was a business. So why did you not take her advice--you did on everything else. Ms. Plaskett said that you should have done your investigation. You said you relied on it, but yet, on the business part, you didn't rely on it.    Mr. Meadows. But that is not what you said, Ms. Winchell, in answering Ms. Plaskett. And again, you are using circular reasoning. You said that it was the IG's assumption that he was either innocent or guilty, and so what you did was took their words and then you came to your own conclusion? Is that what you are saying, without an investigation?    Mr. Meadows. All right. So, Ms. Bruce, Mr. Harris paid 11 employees? That was your testimony? I may have missed that.    Mr. Meadows. Two employees.    Mr. Meadows. So he paid two different employees?    Mr. Meadows. Mr. Harris, was a 1099 filled out or a W-2 filled out for those two employees?    Mr. Meadows. So did they make over $600?    Mr. Meadows. You are under oath. Neither of them made over $600?    Mr. Meadows. Were never paid over $600?    Mr. Meadows. So aren't you required to do a 1099?    Mr. Meadows. I mean, if they are working for you.    Mr. Meadows. Okay.    Mr. Meadows. So you told me it was just a hobby and so now you are detailing operation is just a hobby, is that correct?    Mr. Meadows. Okay. Well, I have two cars. When can I sign up? If it is a hobby, I mean I would love to bring my cars and let you detail my cars. Dr. Harris, I think you and I both know it is not just a hobby.    Mr. Meadows. Okay. Have you done any personal work for anybody, Ms. Winchell, Mr. King?    Mr. Meadows. Ever?    Mr. Meadows. Okay. How do we go from here, Mr. King, because it is not over with this hearing. I know a lot of people like to get prepared for a hearing and say it is all over and it is not over, I can tell you, because we have a responsibility to the American people and responsibility to the Federal workers who were whistleblowers, who are probably disappointed with your response today. So where do we go from here?    Mr. Meadows. So let me ----    Mr. King.--that exist.    Mr. Meadows. Let me close with this last question then. What message does it send to all the Federal workers if we have someone who has been referred for criminal action by the OIG, who has been counseled three times for questionable behavior, and continues to get outstanding performance reviews and bonuses that would make most of us blush? What message does it send, Mr. King?    Mr. Meadows. I agree the message is clear, but I am ----    Mr. Meadows. And the checks kept ----    Mr. Meadows. I will yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
