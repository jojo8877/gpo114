    Ms. Meng. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member.    Welcome to all of our witnesses who are testifying here today.    Assistant Administrator Stivers, thank you once again. I am losing track of how many times you have come to testify before us.    Ms. Meng. I applaud USAID for making great strides and prioritizing and focusing on gender equality and women's economic empowerment. As I listened to you discuss USAID's democracy work, while democracy, gender equality, and women's economic empowerment go hand in hand, but USAID-funded mission programs targeting democracy and human rights in Asia have dramatically decreased over the past several years with funds instead directed to Presidential initiatives.    While we understand that some democracy funding may be attached to the initiatives, those programs don't deal directly with the democracy and human challenges that many countries now face. Does USAID have plans to increase human and labor rights funding, and democracy support in the region and how is USAID integrating these democracy priorities with your gender equality and women's economic empowerment agenda?    Ms. Meng. You mentioned Burma. There are many, many concerns. There is a sense that the situation is getting out of hand. I believe that the State Department has called for a free and fair elections in Burma this year. My understanding is that 25 percent of the seats in the future Parliament are explicitly reserved for members of the military, and those seats are filled by military appointments. Even more concerning is that the military can effectively veto any major changes because those changes require 75 percent of parliamentary majority. How do you reconcile this setup with the call for free and fair elections and have you raised this with Burmese Government?    Ms. Meng. Thank you.
