    Mr. LaMalfa. I have no questions.    Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just had a question I wanted to throw out there on the idea of Puerto Rican bonds that might be going into bankruptcy. I am trying to work through this a little bit here, I am trying to get familiar here, but it is the possibility that previous bonds could end up in bankruptcy. What would that mean for investors? And then, what kind of confidence would anybody have in future bonds going forward?    And then, how would this lay over with how things look with Greece--how would that differ from the country of Greece, with those governments defaulting? What kind of confidence would investors be able to have with Puerto Rico at that point?    Mr. LaMalfa. And that feels like----    Mr. LaMalfa . Already, right? If the court is stopping you from doing things. But----    Mr. LaMalfa. We don't change tax rules every day around here. We have had a package that has been very difficult to do tax reform around here, so it is not as easy as maybe it is made out to be.    But go ahead, sir.    Mr. LaMalfa. Yes, I am sorry, sir.    Mr. LaMalfa. OK, thank you. Just be careful on asking for statehood, because you might get more EPA than you ever asked for, because my resources, we can't get at in California any more due to those guys.
