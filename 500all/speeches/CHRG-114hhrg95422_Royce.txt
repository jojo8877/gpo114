    Chairman Royce. The hearing will come to order.    I will ask all the members to take their seats at this time. Today the committee continues to examine the Obama administration's nuclear diplomacy with Iran as we get set for a congressional review of a possible, and hugely consequential, agreement.    As we speak, U.S. negotiators in Vienna face another deadline. While we don't have an agreement in front of us, we know the troubling outline taking shape. Just a few months ago, 367 Members of Congress signed a letter, Ranking Member Engel and I led stating that any final agreement must last for multiple decades and include full disclosure of Iran's past efforts to build a nuclear weapon, must include a dramatic reduction in the number of centrifuges, and, most importantly, intrusive inspection and verification measures.    A few weeks ago, several of President Obama's former advisers signed an open letter echoing these same concerns and warned that these negotiations may fall short of meeting the administration's own standard of a ``good'' agreement. Indeed, one witness with us today wrote back when these negotiations began, that a ``good enough'' agreement would have Iran giving up ``all but a minimal enrichment capacity,'' agree to intrusive inspections, and would be an agreement that could guarantee the reimposition of sanctions.    But that is not even close to where the negotiations are right now. The ``most robust and intensive inspections,'' and this was the original goal, ``the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history,'' has morphed instead into an agreement of what is now discussed as ``managed access'' with the Iranians having a big say in where international inspectors can go, where international inspectors cannot go. ``Managed access'' is a big back away from the ``anywhere, anytime'' terms that the administration once demanded.    But to be clear, under this agreement, Iran doesn't even have to cheat to be a few steps away from the bomb. Iran is not required to dismantle key bomb-making technology; it is permitted a vast enrichment capacity and it is allowed to continue its research and development to gain an industrialized nuclear program once the agreement begins to expire in as little as 10 years. That is hardly the original concept of ``decades'' of a long-range agreement. And, frankly, it is hardly ``all but minimal enrichment'' that was the original goal as well.    Meanwhile, Iran continues to develop its ballistic missile capabilities. After Iran's Supreme Leader called demands to restrict its missile program a ``stupid, idiotic expectation,'' in his words, U.S. negotiators backed off this key demand. Instead, Iran is still able to ``mass produce'' its ballistic missiles as the Supreme Leader has ordered. If you will recall his quote at the time, he said it is the responsibility of every military man to figure out how to help mass produce ICBMs. We ought to be concerned, really concerned about that attitude, and some of his additional suggestions about what he would like to do to the United States. One witness told the committee last month that, ``no country that has not aspired to possess nuclear weapons has ever opted to sustain'' a costly, long-range missile program. Already, U.S. intelligence estimates Iran to have the largest arsenal of ballistic missiles in the entire Middle East. Simply put, countries build ICBMs to have the capability to deliver nukes.    Not to mention that the terrorist state of Iran will be flush with cash. Reportedly, Iran will receive somewhere in the range of $50 billion under this agreement upfront; $150 billion over the entire length of the agreement. Now, that would be 25 times the annual budget of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. Such a huge amount will breathe life into Iran's economy, but it will also fund a new generation of terrorism in the region and beyond. We should be worried when Iran announces, as they recently did, that they will help rebuild the tunnels in Gaza, that they will transfer missiles to Hamas, and recently that they will provide 100,000 rockets and missiles for Hezbollah with new technology which will allow precision guidance systems so that those rockets and missiles can hit targets across Israel.    At every step in this process, whether it is enrichment capacity, missile development, or sanctions relief, the Obama administration has discounted the fundamental nature of the regime in Iran. ``Death to America'' isn't domestic spin in Iran--it is the regime's rallying cry. And tomorrow, on Friday, they will once again celebrate Quds Day. Since 1979, since the foundation of the revolution, that is the day they set aside to celebrate for the destruction of Israel.    As one witness concludes, ``President Obama is agreeing to dismantle of sanctions regime--permanently. In return, Iran is agreeing to slow the development of its nuclear program--temporarily.'' That is a bad deal for us: Permanent concessions in exchange for temporary benefits, and that is only if Iran doesn't cheat, like North Korea cheated. So Iran is left a few steps away from the bomb and more able to dominate the region. This is my take on this. How does that make us and our allies more secure or conflict less likely? That is the bottom line this committee will continue to look at. Few issues are more important. I now turn to the ranking member for any opening comments that he may have.    Chairman Royce. Thank you, Mr. Engel.    This morning, we are pleased to be joined by a distinguished group of experts. Dr. Michael Doran is a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense and Senior Director at the National Security Council. He is currently a senior fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at the Hudson Institution.    Mr. Stephen Rademaker is former Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of State for the Bureau of Arms Control and Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation. Mr. Rademaker is an adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center and formally served as chief counsel at this committee. And we welcome him back.    Dr. Michael Makovsky also served in the Pentagon where he advised senior officials on defense and energy policy in the Middle East. He currently heads the Iran Task Force at the Institute for National Security Affairs.    Dr. Ken Pollack is a senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at Brookings. Dr. Pollack served twice on the National Security Council where he focused on Iraq, Iran, and the Persian Gulf.    Without objection, the witnesses' full prepared statements will be made part of the record. And members will have 5 calendar days to submit any statements or questions or extraneous materials for the record.    And, Mr. Doran, please summarize your remarks if you will.    Chairman Royce. Mr. Rademaker.    Chairman Royce. Dr. Makovsky.    Chairman Royce. Thank you. Dr. Pollack.    Chairman Royce. Dr. Pollack, your commentary there is interesting to me because there is this phenomenon, this morning the New York Times discusses it, the increasing strident nature of the regime against the United States.    I will just read the story from the New York Times:        ``The chants of `Death to America' and the burning of         American flags on the streets are as familiar a part of         life here as air pollution and traffic jams. With the         United States and Iran on the verge of a potentially         historic nuclear accord, there has been a distinct         change in tone, however. The anti-Americanism is         getting even more strident. The rising levels of         vitriol have been on display this week in the buildup         to the annual anti-Israel extravaganza coming this         Friday.''    So the other part of this is that as we reach out to extend that ``olive branch,'' to quote the Secretary of State's words, you have this reaction in Iran where the Ayatollah speaks even more fervently of the requirement, you know, to develop, to ``mass produce,'' in his words, ICBMs. And this is the aspect of this where I think we are a little disconnected from the reality of the way in which that system works and the individual who makes the decisions over there.    As a matter of fact, Rouhani today is meeting with Putin in Moscow. And what is the Russian demand? And this caught us by surprise this week, the demand from Iran now that we lift the arms embargo. And, of course, they will be getting this huge tranche--I have called it a signing bonus, but they will be getting this cash on the barrel head. And I think Russia is very, very interested in that because you see the stories in the last few weeks about the Russians selling weapons systems to Iran, including, you know, surface-to-air, which, frankly, would allow them maybe to cheat with impunity if they put up a vast enough system across Iran. Now, here is the new demand: Lift the arms embargo.    Dr. Pollack, your thoughts on that.    Chairman Royce. The only caveat I would make is when we are talking about Zarif, remember, we are talking about a man who placed a wreath on the grave of the individual who carried out or masterminded the attack on the Marine Corps barracks in Lebanon. He may seem moderate compared to the Ayatollah. But in terms of what he has called for and his past history running the security state and the torture and execution of people as a consequence puts it in a little bit different perspective in terms of the background of some of these individuals.    But I wanted to ask Mr. Rademaker, as you note in your testimony, Iran has agreed to not enrich uranium over 3.67 percent for at least 15 years. So implicit in that statement is that after 15 years, Iran is going to be permitted to enrich to higher levels. There is no suggestion that there will be any limit on the level to which Iran may enrich after 10 or 15 years or the amount of highly enriched material that it may accumulate. So let us say Iran begins to enrich uranium very close to bomb-grade levels after the sunset, and they say it is to operate a submarine program. What is the world's response to that? I mean, do I understand correctly the way this is teed up here?    Chairman Royce. Well, the other point I would make----    Chairman Royce. Well, even the North Korean agreement did not have a sunset.    Chairman Royce. Now, it had the loopholes in it because we couldn't go ``anytime, anywhere,'' you know, anyplace with the international inspectors. It was only a matter of time before North Korea would figure out a way to cheat on that agreement and get a bomb. But at least it didn't have a sunset. That is the aspect of this I don't understand.    And the last point I would just ask Dr. Doran, you know, the administration says that they don't see, they are going to spend the vast majority of the money when we lift the sanctions, most of it is going to go to butter not to guns. However, the statement I saw was the statement by Iran that they were going to help--this was in The Wall Street Journal--that Iran was going to help rebuild the tunnels--Mr. Engel and I were in one of those tunnels; there are 35 tunnels; they are expensive to build--for Hamas, you know, under Israel and that they were going to supply missiles to replace the inventory that were fired off by Hamas and then, the added story the next day, that they were also going to fund precision-guided rockets and missiles, 100,000 of them, to Hezbollah. That takes a little bit of cash to do that. How do we know that it is all going to butter and not to guns? I would just ask, Dr. Doran, what is your calculus on that?    Chairman Royce. I am glad you brought up that point because not only was the Assad regime on the ropes, but the Iranian regime was on the ropes. And Mr. Engel and I had legislation based on some of the work of Stuart Levey over at Treasury, to give the Ayatollah an actual choice between economic collapse or real compromise on his nuclear program. It passed out of here unanimously in this committee, passed the floor 400 to 20. One of the reasons Iran is a little bit back in the game is because we partially lifted those sanctions. The suggestion in the House was that we double down and give us some real leverage in this negotiation. And the administration made the decision to sit on that legislation or at least, you know, orchestrated in the Senate the inability to bring that to the floor. And I think we lost a lot of leverage out of that.    My time has expired. I need to go to Mr. Engel. Thank you.    Chairman Royce. Thank you, Mr. Engel.    We go to Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.    Chairman Royce . We will go now to Chris Smith of New Jersey.    Chairman Royce. We are going to go to Dr. Ami Bera of California.    Chairman Royce. I think we are out of time.    Shall we go to Joe Wilson, South Carolina.    Chairman Royce. We are going to go to Mr. Gerry Connolly of Virginia.    Chairman Royce. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Connolly.    Now we go to Mr. Darrell Issa of California.    Chairman Royce. Okay. We are going to go to Mr. Brad Sherman of California.
