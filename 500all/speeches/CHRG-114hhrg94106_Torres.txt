    Mrs. Torres. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I apologize to the panel for giving you my back, but unfortunate circumstances of seating arrangements--I would like to go back to the question that was asked by Ranking Member Thompson for you, Under Secretary Taylor. Without a full year funding bill, the Department of Homeland Security cannot award, it was my understanding, $2.6 million, correct? Billion dollars.    Mrs. Torres. Billion in grant funding, much of which goes to State and local departments. Having served both at the local level as a council member/mayor, and having served as a State senator in the State of California, you know, these agencies are just beginning to recover from this great recession that we have had. They certainly do not have the funding to back-bill what we do not send to them, and they are dependent on this funding in order to help protect our communities.    So what do you think is the risk assessment as it relates to these agencies not being able to pick up the phone and have someone on the other side answer to get feedback on a potential threat risk?    Mrs. Torres. Would you consider that a low-risk, a high-risk, in the--as it relates to not just the agencies, but--I am sorry, not just as it relates to the local agencies, but the inability of the FBI or the inability of other departments to be able to coordinate and communicate with these agencies?    Mrs. Torres. Thank you. I yield my time back.
