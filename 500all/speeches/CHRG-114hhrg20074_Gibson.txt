    Mr. GIBSON. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I must say this is an awesome hearing. I am learning a lot and I am really inspired. I appreciate that very much. I know our middle daughter, who is interested in going into business, she is going to find this link very informative and inspiring, and I think she will probably be looking up some of your shows and everything like that going forward.    Mr. Ray, I was very interested to hear your comment. You were using Uber as an example, really as sort of a counter example. What I would like to hear is your thoughts on if we had a do-over, how might federal and state, perhaps even local, governments approach that issue in a manner that would certainly make sure that justice, safety, and public health is preserved, but at the same time, facilitates a good idea that is something that is really being demanded in the market.    Mr. GIBSON. Yes, that is helpful. Do any other panelists want to make any comment on that before I go on to the next?    Mr. GIBSON. I really appreciate those remarks. The last question I have has to do with access to credit and capital, which you all hit on in one form or another. Ms. Solovic's comments about being self-starters and finding ways and working with family, agreeing with all of that, I am also interested in hearing your assessments as to Dodd-Frank, as to how well it is going or challenges that have emerged as it relates to access to capital and credit.    Mr. GIBSON. Well, unfortunately, my time is expired. I want to congratulate each and every one of you on your personal successes and also thank you for sharing those stories for inspiring so many others.    Chairman, I thank you for your indulgence.
