    Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to each of today's witnesses for your testimony. I welcome today's testimony from our panel of practitioners and content area experts. And I view this afternoon's hearing as an important opportunity to shed some light on the financial services industry's ability to effectively monitor, detect, and respond to cyber attacks.    Cyber criminals, state-sponsored and affiliated hackers, and politically-motivated ``hacktivists'' have all targeted the financial services industry. And their tactics have continued to evolve and expand in frequency, scale, sophistication, and severity.    To that end, the financial services industry's response, monitoring, and information-sharing infrastructure, as well as the response capabilities of the relevant Federal regulators, must reflect the dynamic nature of cyber threats.    Mr. Chairman, I firmly believe that cybersecurity is one of a few issues where our committee can truly work in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that our regulators and regulated entities have the necessary resources and support to defend against cyber attacks. I look forward to each witnesses' testimony, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Clay. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Clay. Let me start with Mr. Healey. Given the level of sophistication of cyber attacks from China, in particular, is it reasonable to expect that financial institutions will be successful in stopping them?    Mr. Clay. Anyone else? Mr. Fitzgibbons?    Mr. Clay. Mr. Bentsen?    Mr. Clay. Can any other panelist give me a sense of the scope and nature of the types of cyber attacks that we are seeing from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran?    Mr. Healey, any sense of--    Mr. Clay. --the scope of the attacks?    Mr. Clay. Mr. Fitzgibbons?    Mr. Clay. Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
