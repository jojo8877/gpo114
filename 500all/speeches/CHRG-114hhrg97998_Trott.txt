    Mr. Trott. Thank you, Chairwoman Ros-Lehtinen and Ranking Member Connolly. Although it has been a tumultuous few years, Egypt has always been an important and integral part of the United States-Middle East policy, even more so as our allies in the region face a range of threats from various state and non-state actors.    While most of the testimony today is going to rightfully be focused on security and stability in the elections, I would like to bring awareness to the situation of the    Copts, the region's largest Christian community. This past October, we commemorated the 4-year anniversary of Maspero, where peaceful protestors, mostly Copts, were attacked by state security forces. January 1 commemorates the 5-year anniversary of the bombing of the All Saints Church in Alexandria, where Copts were attacked and killed reportedly by non-state actors. This follows a disturbing trend of persecution against a peaceful group of people who have been in Egypt since Saint Mark brought Christianitythere over 2,000 years ago. The Copts under Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood were at the height of their modern-day persecution, with unprecedented attacks and rhetoric aimed at their Pope and religious institutions.    I was happy to see President Sisi visit a Coptic church to celebrate Christmas last year, and I hope that this is a sign that his administration will be as inclusive as possible with the Copts. This is an important issue I plan to stay focused on as Egypt looks to regain its footing, both domestically and internationally. I look forward to hearing from our esteemed panel particularly how the Copts are faring under President Sisi and what steps the Egyptian Government is taking to ensure that the Copts are part of Egypt's future.    I yield back my time.
