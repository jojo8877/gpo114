    Mr. Smith. Good morning, and the hearing will come to order.    And we thank all of you, especially all of the left-behind parents I see in the audience--and there are many--for joining us this morning to discuss how the U.S. Department of State's first annual report under the Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act can better correspond with the mandate set by Congress and achieve the return of abducted American children, which is the ultimate objective of the Goldman Act.    Every year, as we know, an estimated 1,000 American children are unlawfully removed from their homes by one of their parents and taken across international borders. As many of you know all too well, international parental child abduction rips children from their homes and families and whisks them away to a foreign land alienating them from the love and care of the parent and family left behind.    Child abduction is child abuse, and it continues to plague families across the United States and across the world. For decades, the State Department has used quiet diplomacy to attempt to bring these children home. But we know that less than half of these children ever come home, even from countries that have signed the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.    In a hearing I held on this issue back in 2009, former Assistant Secretary of State Bernie Aronson called quiet diplomacy ``a sophisticated form of begging.'' Thousands of American families, still ruptured and grieving from years of unresolved abductions, confirm that quiet diplomacy is gravely inadequate.    Last year, Congress unanimously passed the Goldman Act to give teeth to requests for return and for access. The actions required by the law escalate in severity and range from official protest through diplomatic channels to extradition to the suspension of development, security, or other foreign assistance.    The Goldman Act is a law calculated to get results, as we did in the return of Sean Goldman from Brazil in late December 2009. But the new law is only as good as its implementation. The State Department's first annual report that we are reviewing today is the first step in moving past quiet diplomacy to results. The State Department must get this report right in order to trigger the actions above and for the law to be an effective tool.    Countries should be listed as worst offenders if they have high numbers of cases--30 percent or more--that have been pending over a year, or if their law enforcement, judiciary, or central authority for abduction regularly fail in their duties under the Hague Convention or other controlling agreements, or if the country simply fails to work with the United States to resolve cases.    Once these countries are properly classified, the Secretary of State then determines which of the aforementioned sanctions the United States will apply to the country in order to encourage the timely resolution of abduction and access cases.    While the State Department has choice on which tools to apply, and can waive actions for up to 180 days, the State Department does not have discretion over whether to report accurately to Congress on the country's record or whether the country is objectively non-compliant.    As we have seen in the human trafficking context--and I would note parenthetically I authored the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 as well as the Goldman Act--accurate accounting of a country's record, especially in comparison with other countries, can do wonders to prod much-needed reform. Accurate reporting is also critical to family court judges across the country, and parents considering their child's travel to a country where abduction or access problems are a risk.    The stakes are high. Misleading or incomplete information could mean the loss of another American child to abduction. For example, a judge might look at the report table filled with zeroes in the unresolved cases category, such as is the case with Japan, and erroneously conclude that a country is not of concern, giving permission to an estranged spouse to travel with a child for a vacation.    The estranged spouse then abducts the child, and the left-behind parent spends his or her life savings and many years trying to get the child returned to the United States, all of which could have been avoided with accurate reporting on the danger.    I am very concerned that the first annual report contains major gaps and even misleading information, especially when it comes to countries with which we have the most intractable abduction cases. For example, the report indicates that India, which has consistently been in the top five destinations for abducted children, has 19 new cases in 2014, 22 resolved cases, and no unresolved cases. However, we know that from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that India has 53 open cases, and that 51 have been pending for more than 1 year.    While the State Department has shown willingness to work constructively on making the report better, for example, meeting last week with our staff, our June 11 hearing left many questions unanswered as to why this report failed to hold countries accountable for unresolved cases.    We wrote the law with the belief that the State Department was formally raising these cases by name, with the foreign ministries of destination countries, and asked that cases still pending for 1 year after being raised would be counted as unresolved. But these cases were not included in the report.    A few parents who reported their cases to the State Department years ago, and who have consistently been asking the Department for help, were told by their case officers recently that the cases were formally communicated to India in May 2015. May 2015. Clearly, delay is denial. They thought that that was not the case.    The Goldman Act also requires that the State Department take actions against countries, such as India and Japan, if they refuse to resolve abduction and access cases. The Goldman Act requires the State Department to bring negotiations with countries like India and Japan for a bilateral agreement to secure resolution of the more than 100 open cases we have pending with those two countries, cases that are not listed as unresolved in the report.    The Goldman Act requires an end to the status quo, but the first step to change is telling the truth in the report, which is why I am so concerned that Japan was not listed as showing a persistent failure to work with the United States on abduction issues. Japan has never issued and enforced a return order for a single one of the hundreds of American children abducted there. It holds the world record on the abduction of American children never returned. And yet it got a pass on more than 50 known open cases, most of which have been pending for 5 years or more.    Among those cases is that of Sergeant Michael Elias, who has not seen his children, Jade and Michael, since 2008. Michael served as a Marine who saw combat in Iraq. His wife, who worked in the Japanese Consulate, used documents fraudulently obtained, with the apparent complicity of the Japanese Consulate personnel, to kidnap their children, then aged four and two, in defiance of a court order telling Michael on a phone call that there was nothing that he could do. And she said, ``My country''--that is, Japan--``will protect me.''    Her country, very worried about its designation in the new report, sent a high-level delegation to the United States in March to meet with Ambassador Jacobs, our distinguished witness, who will lead off today's hearing, and explain why Japan should be excused from being listed as non-compliant, despite the fact that more than 1 year after signing the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction Japan has ordered zero returns to the U.S.    Just before the report was released in May, 2 weeks late, Takashi Okada, Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told the Japanese Diet that he had been in consultation with the State Department and, ``Because we strive to make an explanation to the U.S. side, I hope that the report contents will be based on our country's efforts.''    In other words, Japan understood it could get a pass potentially from the United States and escape the list of countries facing action by the U.S. for their failure to resolve abduction cases based on what Mr. Okada euphemistically referred as ``efforts,'' not concrete results.    Sergeant Michael Elias' country has utterly failed to protect him. He has seen zero progress, and I traveled to Japan myself with Michael's mother. And the idea there was, as she had a very close relationship with her daughter-in-law, that at least the grandmother of those children might have access, and we utterly failed during that trip to garner any kind of access, contact, and certainly no action on returning his children.    The Goldman Act is clear. All results for return that the State Department submitted to the Foreign Ministry and that remain unresolved 12 months later are to be counted against Japan and followed up with action. The Goldman Act has given the State Department new and powerful tools to bring Japan and other countries to the resolution table.    The goal is not to disrupt relations but to heal the painful rifts caused by international child abduction. The question still remains: Will the State Department use the Goldman Act as required by law?    I would like to yield to my good friend and colleague, Mr. Cicilline, for any opening comments he might have.    Mr. Smith. I would like to now introduce our distinguished witness, first witness. Ambassador Susan Jacobs currently serves as Special Advisor in the Office of Children's Issues at the U.S. Department of State. Ambassador Jacobs has had a long career in the Foreign Service in which she has served around the world, including in Papua New Guinea, where she was Ambassador. She has also held a number of senior positions with the State Department in Washington, serving as a liaison to both Congress and Department of Homeland Security.    Ambassador Jacobs recently traveled to Japan and to Macau for a Hague conference to promote resolutions of child abduction and access cases.    And, Madam Ambassador, the floor is yours.    Ambassador Jacobs. Chairman Smith and distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to appear before you again. I am very pleased to be here.    Nothing is more important to me than the safety, health, and happiness of my own children and grandchildren. So as the Secretary's Special Advisor for Children's Issues, I seek the same for all children around the world, especially those who are victims of international parental child abduction.    To the families whose children were abducted, you have my heartfelt sympathy. I take your real-life stories with me when I meet with foreign government officials, and I raise your cases at the highest levels. We recognize that parents who are on active military service face an extra burden.    Abduction is wrong, it is not safe for children, and it is not fair to the child or to the left-behind parent, yet these cases are complicated and difficult to resolve because once the parent and child have crossed an international border they are subject to the laws of another country.    We place great importance on combating international parental child abduction. Our work on every case and every bilateral relationship matters, and we have the tools that work now, but we think with this new law they will be even more effective in the future.    Our work matters. The prevention branch in the Office of Children's Issues, working with colleagues at State, with law enforcement, and with NGO counterparts, through the reinvigorated process given us by the law, has stopped 360 abductions since 2011, but 66 in the first 6 months of this year, 2 of which were prevented just yesterday.    So this is very good news. We already have reports in addition that 202 children have been returned from various countries to the United States under the provisions of either the Convention or non-Convention. Through the Hague Convention on International Parental Child Abduction, one of the most important tools that we have, we have partnerships with 73 countries, and we are seeking to increase the number of Convention partners every day.    But even as we celebrate these successes, we still have work to do to return children from Convention and non-Convention countries. The 2015 annual report was the first under the new law. We compiled it under a compressed timeline and devoted significant effort to make sure that we included everything required in the law.    We fully understand that this report did not meet all expectations. We have received valuable feedback from this subcommittee, from others in Congress, from parents, and from NGOs about areas that need to be clarified with additional data. As Pope Francis said, ``Criticism must be received, it must be studied, and dialogue must follow.''    The 2015 annual report provides important opportunities to us. Our diplomatic missions overseas have delivered demarches to every country that was listed as non-complying as soon as the report was issued. We underscore our ongoing engagement through my trips to India, Japan, the Philippines, and Central America, as well as through multilateral meetings. We have informed governments of the potential repercussions if they are designated as showing patterns of non-compliance and followed up with demarches.    Let me talk about Japan for just a moment. I know that you and many parents are frustrated with the data that was furnished in the report on the Japanese cases. We will be posting supplemental data on our Web site with additional context that I hope will fill many of the gaps that you have identified.    As of July 1, the Office of Children's Issues, as the Central Authority, has cases involving 109 children to Japan. These cases include parents who are seeking the return of their children, as well as access, and in some cases both. But I think that we all agree that one case is one case too many.    And I know that you and others remain concerned that Japan was not cited as demonstrating a pattern of non-compliance in the report. But let me underscore: This report is not silent on Japan. The report acknowledges that the pre-Convention cases have languished for years, with little or no action, and we highlight this worrying lack of progress.    But as a Convention partner, Japan is fulfilling its treaty obligations. Japanese courts have ordered the return of abducted children to the United States. Japan has appointed two Hague network judges and has consolidated courts to hear return and access cases. But, still, the treatment of the pre-Convention cases is problematic, and we did raise every case with the Japanese on my recent visit. And we have told them, and they understand, that the status quo is not acceptable or sustainable.    With the support of Ambassador Kennedy and the leadership of the Department's East Asia and Pacific Affairs Bureau, we will continue to work together to resolve the pre-Convention cases.    We also appreciate the great interest shown by this committee, and by the Congress as a whole, and I believe that we will make more progress on abductions with Japan through sustained, proactive, rigorous engagement. In this diplomatic engagement, we have found that it is effective with all countries, not just Japan, and not just with countries that are demonstrating patterns of non-compliance. We analyze every country and every case to decide what appropriate actions need to be taken.    Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee, we do the work on IPCA together. It matters, and it works. Left-behind parents and their supporters do not have a choice to be involved in this issue. Their involvement is imposed on them by the reckless acts of others.    We in the Office of Children's Issues have voluntarily chosen to make this heartbreaking issue our professional calling. Numbers and reports may detail our efforts or reflect our proficiency, but they cannot show the heart that we bring to this important work on behalf of children and families, and I am honored every day to lead this team.    We are committed to fully and successfully implementing the law, and we are confident that the tools in the law will be even more effective in the future. Your support remains a key element to our success in improving the effectiveness of IPCA prevention, maintaining IPCA as a priority in our relationships with other countries, and pressing for viable resolutions in all cases.    Thank you very much, and I will be pleased to take your questions.    Mr. Smith. Ambassador Jacobs, thank you very much for your testimony and for being with us today, and your staff and top leadership just several weeks ago on this very issue.    I have a couple of questions, beginning first with the supplemental data which you mentioned.    Ambassador Jacobs. Yes.    Mr. Smith. Is that data likely to change the designation of Japan from its current status of being non-compliant?    Ambassador Jacobs. No, it won't, because we were judging Japan on its performance as a Convention country. But in the report you will notice it is the only country in which we gave a detailed narrative, so that we could capture the lack of progress in the pre-Convention cases.    Mr. Smith. Well, with total respect to you, and to your office, which I have a great deal of respect for----    Ambassador Jacobs. Thank you.    Mr. Smith . The report, on page 17, says that there are zero unresolved cases.    Ambassador Jacobs. That will be corrected, sir.    Mr. Smith. But, you know, remember, the language of the Goldman Act made it very clear that the calendar year is what needed to be reviewed, whether or not--and, again, even under the Hague, as far as I know, and you can correct this if you have new information, nobody still has been returned to the United States from Japan pursuant to the Hague Convention.    But the over 50 cases--and we had a--as you might recall, a representative from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, at this witness table just several weeks ago, who confirmed what we knew by our own numbers, that there, again, are over 50 unresolved cases, many of which are 5 years or more.    Captain Paul Toland, for example, you know, a distinguished member of our Armed Forces, you know, had his daughter abducted when he was deployed to Yokohama, defending not only the United States but also Japan as part of a force agreement that makes us very, very close allies. And his wife has passed, and yet he still has had neither access nor a return of his daughter, who is now a very young teenager, and it has been a dozen years for him.    That case alone, but then when multiplied by one case after another, including witnesses we will hear from today, I don't know how--and I say this with total respect--I don't know how Japan is not on the non-compliant list. And added to that, because--again, the Goldman Act said to look back 1 calendar year.    And added to that is the issue of a protocol which you reference in your testimony, which I have been pushing for at least 6 years. When I was in Japan I said a Hague ratification without a concurrent protocol or MOU, whatever we might want to call it, a bilateral agreement with Japan to resolve these existing cases, is like a double tragedy for the families. The door gets slammed in their face, because everything from Hague on is from that day a ratification forward, and they are thrown under the bus a second time and abandoned a second time.    The pushback has been profound for years. No bilateral agreement. I am hoping that will be revisited as well, and we will get a bilateral agreement that will lead to returns and not rhetoric.    Ambassador Jacobs. Let me assure you, sir, that we are not throwing the parents and the children and the pre-Convention cases under the bus. Everything is on the table with Japan. We had, for me, the highest level meeting that I have had there, and we stressed that the status quo on the pre-Convention cases is not acceptable, and that we need to find a way to resolve these cases.    There was--and let me----    Mr. Smith. But, again----    Ambassador Jacobs . Also mention we didn't give Japan a pass. We made a determination that we were going to judge Japan on--first, let me explain about the unresolved cases. We did the best we could, looking at the definitions in the law. I know that it was not satisfactory from all the comments that we have gotten, so we have gone back to capture the universe of the cases that exist in every country like Japan and like India.    So that information will be posted within a week on our Web site, travel.state.gov, and we will be sure and send you the information in advance.    Mr. Smith. But----    Ambassador Jacobs. This report was the first effort to comply with the law. We understand that it was not satisfactory to many people, and we want to do a better job, present the best report that we can in the future. And if that means putting in more narrative and explaining things better or differently, that is our goal.    We want your feedback. And if you--when you get this new information, and you still believe there are gaps, then you need to tell us, so that we can continue to talk about it and try to get you the kind of report that will be helpful and satisfactory and capture the entirety of the abduction issue and these cases. But we are not giving up on any means of reaching the kinds of conclusions that the parents want.    Mr. Smith. I would respectfully submit that the future is now for these parents. Waiting----    Ambassador Jacobs. I don't disagree.    Mr. Smith . Another year to do a report--Japan--it is inexplicable how Japan is not on the list. Now, whether or not the U.S. Government imposes a sanction of any kind is left to the discretion of the Department, and what works is left to the chief executive.    But getting the report right, I mean, after the last hearing I called it a whitewash, which I do believe it is. I mean, you go to the report and look on page 17, unresolved cases----    Ambassador Jacobs. Look at the narrative.    Mr. Smith . Abduction, it is down to zero.    Ambassador Jacobs. But look at the narrative.    Mr. Smith. I read the narrative. But it is contradictory to the table that supposedly tells the whole story.    Ambassador Jacobs. I understand that, and so you are going to get new data that will reflect all the cases, the entirety of the cases in Japan.    Mr. Smith. I understand that. Now, will the new data that comes----    Ambassador Jacobs. And Convention.    Mr. Smith . To Congress' way then lead to a new designation of pattern of non-compliance?    Ambassador Jacobs. I don't know. It probably will not, but that doesn't mean that they are getting a pass. Can I tell you how upset they were with that report? It really got their attention----    Mr. Smith. But there is still nobody----    Ambassador Jacobs . Like nothing else has.    Mr. Smith . No children coming home.    Ambassador Jacobs. The combination of the law and the report really brought home to the Japanese Government that something needs to be done. And we are working on that, and nothing is off the table, including an MOU.    Mr. Smith. I hear you say, again, Madam Secretary--Madam Ambassador, that----    Ambassador Jacobs. I like the promotion. Thank you.    Mr. Smith. After I pushed for 3 years to get the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which had real and does have real sanctions--and we are late on that report, too, frankly. It is supposed to be June 1, I would note parenthetically, and a lot of us think it has to do with Malaysia. That is a whole other issue; it has to do with the TPP and a press conference that will be held this afternoon in a bipartisan way with Rosa DeLauro and others.    But that said, we tried to make sure that the report was absolutely sacred in terms of its data. Israel was put on Tier 3. South Korea, two allies with whom we are as close as it gets, and Israel had a huge trafficking problem, as did South Korea. South Korea, when they were on the sanctions list and were at risk of losing security aid, went overtime to pass a large number of important reform laws, as did Israel.    Israel cracked down, particularly in Tel Aviv, on the brothels where a lot of women were being exploited and cruelly mistreated as trafficked women, and all of a sudden--and I remember meeting with the Ambassador. He came in with a compliance--the possibility of the sanctions really, once the report is done right, sharpens the mind. And they can be angry all they want about anything that is in the report, but if there is no possibility of a sanctions regime, like a sword of Damocles hanging over their head, they will not respond.    And, again, nobody has come back. And what we are asking for is just complete and total honesty. You know, the Bush and certainly the Obama administration, Luis CdeBaca, who was the Ambassador-at-Large for trafficking, they made sure the report was right. There are always a couple of exceptions. But, frankly, they really made sure the report was right. Again, putting Israel and South Korea on there was proof positive.    Japan has to be on that list, or else a year from now we are going to have the same--we will have four more hearings between now and then. We will hear from parents who are heartbroken. Paul Toland will tell his case, others will tell their case, and we will still have kids that are being held, and the Japanese Government, you know, will be non-compliant. It has got to be non-compliant.    Ambassador Jacobs. But let me say that even if Japan is not listed as non-compliant doesn't mean that we are not pushing them to do what they need to do.    Mr. Smith. But they got away with it this year.    Ambassador Jacobs. Well, I----    Mr. Smith. They did get away with it.    Ambassador Jacobs . I would disagree with you. But next year is next year. The report is a snapshot in time, and it doesn't mean that we forget about what we are doing from writing one report to the next report. And I don't--we are not prejudging any country. We are not trying to give any country a pass. We are working to do the best job that we can, and we will continue to push for the resolution.    Mr. Smith. Madam Ambassador, when you testified on May 9, 2013--and I did raise this with your staff when they were here several weeks ago--you had said that we need to reach an agreement with Japan--and we are talking about a bilateral agreement, and hopefully that is done immediately. I mean, what can be the hold up?    But you also said--and it was very disturbing because it was like the harbinger of what we are dealing with right now--``That the return of these children is important,'' you said--and I am glad you said that--``but I don't think we are going to sanction Japan or threaten them with sanctions because I think that would be detrimental to our bilateral relationship.''    Ambassador Jacobs. Okay.    Mr. Smith. The bilateral relationship should be built on a two-way street, reciprocity, and these are American children abducted and left-behind American parents.    Ambassador Jacobs. But what this report gives us instead are options for actions that we can take that I think are distinguishable from sanctions which have to be agreed to by the entire government. It isn't the Office of Children's Issues that decides on sanctioning a country.    Mr. Smith. True.    Ambassador Jacobs. It has to be--can I just finish, please? It has to be decided by the Department of State and then through the interagency process. But that doesn't mean that there aren't actions that you give us in the report that we can take, such as a demarche or an official statement or a public condemnation.    Mr. Smith. Have they been demarched?    Ambassador Jacobs. These are--yes, they have been demarched.    Mr. Smith. And what is their response?    Ambassador Jacobs. Their response was, ``Please give us some time to work this out.'' Look, you asked what the response was. That is the response.    Mr. Smith. I know.    Ambassador Jacobs. But we have put other options on the table, and we raised----    Mr. Smith. The reason for this----    Ambassador Jacobs . We raised----    Mr. Smith . Follow-up hearing----    Ambassador Jacobs . We raised an MOU with them. We raised the idea of an MOU.    Mr. Smith. And what did they say?    Ambassador Jacobs. We need two people to negotiate on that. They haven't agreed to it yet, and we will continue to raise it.    Mr. Smith. Okay. Who raised it, you?    Ambassador Jacobs. I did. Yes.    Mr. Smith. And they said no, or----    Ambassador Jacobs. No. They did not say no. They said, ``It is something that we will consider.'' I hope that doesn't mean no, because we will continue to raise it.    Mr. Smith. One of the points that Patricia Apy makes, which is a leading expert and was David Goldman's lead attorney, that I think is very compelling--and she underscores the impact that the report has on judges when they are ascertaining whether or not a child should travel with one parent to a place like Japan. They will look at this report. And if I were a judge sitting here with robes, I would say, ``Japan, zero unresolved cases.''    Ambassador Jacobs. That is going to be----    Mr. Smith. ``Everything is fine. You can go.''    Ambassador Jacobs. Sir, we are revising that. They will get new information. And let me tell you, you know what the Japanese told us? That there have been fewer abductions to Japan since the law went into effect.    Mr. Smith. That is good.    Ambassador Jacobs. So I think that that is a positive.    Mr. Smith. Can you tell us why it was--on page 17 you did put zero in?    Ambassador Jacobs. We put in zero because we defined the law as a request for a return that was pending over 12 months, and there were very few direct requests for return to the proper judicial or administrative authority made by the parents. In most of the cases, parents have asked for access or custody, and the law that you wrote defines it as a return.    Now, after receiving the criticism, we understand that we needed to include a greater universe of cases, and so the new data that you will get reflects all the cases that we know of in a country, whether it is pre-Convention or post-Convention.    Mr. Smith. You know, the legislative history of the law--and it took 5 years to be enacted, multiple hearings, floor debates, bipartisanship in a great way in a town where that has been less than evidenced in recent years, both House and Senate couldn't have been clearer, especially with the left-behind parents from Japan, that they all asked for the return of their children.    They were encouraged, many of them, to go to an access mode, because they had not seen their children, but they are still pending on their return request. I couldn't have made that clearer. Every hearing I have had somebody left behind, a father or mother, from Japan testify. Just from that record alone would meet the non-compliant record of having made those requests.    And I know your office knew about it. We have been to your office. We have met with them. We even had a rally and a march on the office once, and I joined them for that. During the David Goldman case it was filled with left-behind parents from Japan, Americans whose children were abducted to Japan. Please don't say that they have not gone through the proper channels of seeking access.    One of the reasons why we put in language on DOD was that Captain Toland got bad advice from his JAG as to how to deal with it in Japan and which further hurt his case in reclaiming his daughter from the grandmother who wouldn't even allow a phone call.    So, again, I would hope and I would respectfully ask, they need to be redesignated. There is nothing in the law that precludes you from, based on the evidence, and an admittance today, that you got it wrong by making zero unresolved cases, to now say that they do fit the criteria. They are a country that is non-compliant. And I do believe that will make the MOU work or there will be more ready to do that. Waiting a year is an eternity for these left-behind parents. An eternity.    Ambassador Jacobs. I understand that, sir.    Mr. Smith. Thank you.    Mr. Cicilline.    Mr. Smith. Mr. Meadows.    Mr. Smith. Let me just, Madam Ambassador, this false sense that there is any ambiguity in the definitions. We wrote those definitions, and worked with legislative counsel, with a large--we asked for your input. It couldn't be clearer what a pattern of non-compliance means, and it says--and it is all spelled out in riveting detail in the legislation.    And that persistent failure is if 30 percent or more of the total abduction cases of such a country are unresolved abduction cases. And it has other criteria as well, but that stands as one; one or more of the following criteria is enough to trigger a pattern of non-compliance designation.    On the whole issue of unresolved abduction cases, in a like manner we lay that out. I keep reading this and reading it. The last time I read it to your staff when they testified and said, ``Where is the ambiguity?'' There isn't any. My concern is that Japan was put--I mean, when you talk about grading, maybe some of the countries where it was easier to give a pattern of non-compliance, but Japan, with all due respect, you get an F for that one. And, thankfully, you will at least change the unresolved cases category.    But how that doesn't then trigger the next shoe dropping, that they are now in the designation of pattern of non-compliance, it is bewildering beyond words, because that is what happens when you have so many cases. The definition is clear, not ambiguous. And, again, we had both the Senate and the House, my staff, the Judiciary staff, the Senators' staff, everybody went over these definitions with such attention, to get it right. And then Japan mysteriously falls off.    You know, we have some of our witnesses, and I do hope you will stay----    Ambassador Jacobs. Unfortunately, I have another meeting that I cannot avoid.    Mr. Smith. Please take their statements if you would.    Ambassador Jacobs. I have seen--I had talked to a lot of the parents before.    Mr. Smith. Randy Collins makes a very important point. I would like this committee to insist that OCI and the State Department be far more transparent with Congress and with victimized parents. ``We deserve answers,'' he says. ``Simply telling this committee that they are raising our cases means nothing. What are they saying? Who are they saying it to? We have suffered years of secrecy from State regarding our abducted children. Are they demanding the return of our children or simply begging?'' as he point out.    I have asked that question a number of times. One time at a press conference over at the grassy triangle. I am a great Seinfeld fan. I love Seinfeld. I have seen every episode 15 times. One of them was a case of the file, the Pensky file. George Costanza has this file, a Pensky file, and he puts it in his desk. Pensky himself comes in and George says that he is working Pensy's file. And nobody knows what they are doing.    And I raise this again with respect--when you get a case that is pending before you, you have a case officer, are they fighting hard? And does it trickle up, hopefully put up, to the levels of the political side to say, ``This stuff means something to us. We want this resolved.'' Because my feeling has been, and I saw it with David Goldman, David Goldman went for 5 years with his case, won in some of the courts, lost in others.    But it was always the wonderful Consular Affairs people who tried to do welfare and whereabouts. They love David. They love everything about trying to resolve the case. But it never got to the point where the political side said, ``This is something the United States of America cares about.'' And that is where there is this total disconnect. Again, when you get it wrong in the report, it makes it even harder. What do you say?    We now hear--and I asked Secretary Kerry when he testified when President Obama and when Secretary Kerry went there, did they raise individual cases? We have learned in human rights work you raise individual cases. You don't say generically, ``We are all for ending parental child abduction.'' And he said that they raised it at every level.    Are these cases brought? The ones who will testify, the left-behind parents today, does somebody say, ``This means something to us. Here are the details. Let us resolve this.'' That is the problem. And with Japan, even when I was over there, I got the sense that there was empathy, but it was not a political priority. Everything else, Status of Forces agreements, everything else under the sun, put this on page 5 as a footnote.    Ambassador Jacobs. It is a political priority now.    Mr. Smith. Okay. If you could, again, revisit. And I don't know how you update the unresolved cases and not put Japan on it.    Ambassador Jacobs. You are going to see----    Mr. Smith. It ought to be on the list. And what you do sanctions-wise is all up to you, of course with----    Ambassador Jacobs. Actions. Actions, sir.    Mr. Smith . Reporting to Congress about what you do or don't do.    Ambassador Jacobs. Actions.    Mr. Smith. We want actions.    Ambassador Jacobs. Actions.    Mr. Smith. But we need the designation to be accurate and clear. Otherwise, we will be here a year from now talking about the same thing.    Okay. But F for Japan so far. I would love for all of us to put that as an A.    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Madam Ambassador.    Ambassador Jacobs. Thank you, sir.    Mr. Smith. And I look forward to that designation of Japan. Sure hope you do it.    I would like to now welcome our second panel, beginning with Patricia Apy, who is a partner in the law firm of Paras, Apy & Reiss, who specializes in complex family litigation, particularly international interstate child custody litigation. Her qualifications for testifying are impressive and extensive. She has litigated and been qualified as an expert witness in connection with family disputes throughout the world.    Ms. Apy frequently consults and is regularly qualified as an expert on family dispute resolution in non-Hague countries in risk factors for child abduction. She was also one of the lead attorneys, as I said, the principal attorney for David Goldman and provided expert advice and counsel in that long and arduous case.    We will then hear from Mr. Randy Collins, who is the father of Keisuke Collins, who was abducted to Japan in June 2008 by the non-custodial mother. He is also the managing director of Bring Abducted Children Home, an NGO working for the return of children abducted to Japan, and for the children's access to both parents.    As a resident of California, Mr. Collins inspired and helped write, with then-California State Senator, now Congresswoman Walters, SB 1206, also known as Keisuke's Law, which was named after his son and helps to deter future parental child abductions. The law was unanimously passed in the California Legislature in 2012.    We will then hear from Ms. Kelly Rutherford, who is the mother of two young children, Helena and Hermes, now 6 and 8 years old, who were sent by a U.S. court 3 years ago to live with their father abroad solely because their father alleged he could not enter the U.S.    Ms. Rutherford has since traveled to Monaco 70 times--70 times--to see her children and has had to declare bankruptcy. When the children's father began denying her access to their children this year, she again had to go to court in Monaco while continuing litigation in the U.S. Ms. Rutherford founded the Children's Justice Campaign to help other parents avoid the international legal nightmare she is now enduring.    We will then hear from Dr. Samina Rahman, who is currently a resident in internal medicine at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. She studied medicine at Gulf Medical University in the United Arab Emirates, and moved to the U.S. in July 2012, where she was joined by her son and husband.    However, as she will relay, her husband became verbally and physically abusive of her, as well as threatening to her son, culminating in his covert abduction of their son to India in 2013, a place the family had never lived. She is the sole custodian of her son under U.S. law, but has been able to speak to her son just 12 times in 2 years while India very slowly takes steps to consider her case.    And then we will hear from Diane McGee, who is the mother of several children who have been held by her American husband in Japan since 2012. Ms. McGee and her husband were married in New York, and each of their four children were born in the United States. The McGees temporarily relocated to Japan in 2011 when Mr. McGee was offered a job there, but maintained their home in New Jersey.    Ms. McGee's husband reneged on his promise to return with the children to New Jersey and began divorce proceedings in Japan in 2012. Ms. McGee returned to the U.S. with the youngest child in December 2012, and has suffered parental alienation from the older children and poverty while fighting for their return.    Ms. Apy.    We are joined by the distinguished Chairman of the full Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce.    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Chairman Royce. And thank you for your work on the Goldman Act, and as full committee chairman, for making this a priority of our full committee. Thank you.    Mr. Smith. We are also joined by a good friend of mine from the State of New Jersey, Leonard Lance.    Mr. Smith. Ms. Apy, thank you very much.    Before we go into Mr. Collins, let me welcome Sheila Jackson Lee, the gentlelady from Texas.    Mr. Smith. Thank you.    Mr. Collins.    Mr. Smith. Thank you very much.    Ms. Rutherford.    Mr. Smith. Ms. Rutherford, thank you so very much for your testimony.    Dr. Rahman.    Mr. Smith. Ms. Rahman, if you could just briefly, to interrupt, we have----    Mr. Smith . We are on zero for a vote. No. We will come back, and you can pick up where you have left off. But we will take a short recess. We have five votes, and I deeply apologize to you for that. But hopefully 20 minutes, 25 minutes or so, we will be right back.    Mr. Smith. And reconvene. Thank you.    Mr. Smith. First of all, let me again express to our distinguished witnesses and guests here, I apologize for that long delay. We did have a series of votes, and they went a little bit longer than advertised.    But, Dr. Rahman, if you would continue?    Mr. Smith. Thank you very much, Dr. Rahman.    Ms. McGee.    Mr. Smith. Thank you very much, Ms. McGee. And your testimony, and that of all of our very distinguished witnesses, not only put a human face on the agony that you face, but all the others who have been left behind. And, frankly, this is like our fifteenth hearing or so, and always with a group of people who have lost loved ones, children, or had a court, as in Ms. Rutherford's case, do an awful job and not understanding.    And, Ms. Apy, you might want to speak to uninformed judges and how deleterious that is to cases, if you would.    But thank you so very, very much for that. Just a couple of questions.    You were all here for the testimony from Ambassador Jacobs earlier. The fact that egregious omissions remain in the first report seem to be on the cusp of being rectified. I will wait and see. I am not from Missouri, but I am from New Jersey, and we have the same motto sometimes. But the abduction idea of unresolved cases for zero for Japan, obviously for two of you had to have been like a hot poker in the face.    I mean, when I read that, I kept saying, ``I am missing something. What am I missing?'' And the Ambassador did indicate that they are going to fix that, but with that comes the designation of non-compliant, which follows like day follows night. And we will be asking, as I did here today, repeatedly asking that, don't wait until next year's report. Do it now. And my hope is that they will do it now, and then take appropriate actions.    The only reason I brought up how we got Korea and Israel's attention on trafficking was that we couldn't have closer allies than those two countries, and yet we were honest enough to put in the report for trafficking exactly what the situation was on the ground. No games, no brinkmanship, no omissions.    So I can assure you we are going to keep trying, and hopefully she and the Office of Children's Issues and all those who make decisions at State will amend an egregiously flawed report.    And I also, hopefully, will finally get to the bottom of what do the Foreign Service Officers do, what do OCI people do in a very tangible way to take the cases and represent the American citizen, you, who has been so wrongly dealt with.    So maybe some thoughts on that, if any of you would like to share what you think the Department has done.    Ms. Apy, on prevention and recovery, what does the State Department's excluding pending abduction cases from the report have on the goals of prevention and recovery?    Ms. Rutherford, you made some recommendations for possible legislation. If you could maybe elaborate where in the queue is your case, before the U.S. Supreme Court, I take it? Or is it State Supreme Court?    Mr. Smith. Okay. Okay.    Mr. Smith. Right. Right.    Mr. Smith. Well, you----    Mr. Smith. In Japan----Mr. Smith. Okay. Thank you.    And, again, Ms. Apy maybe to speak to the issue of judges being properly trained and informed about these cases.    Mr. Smith. Mr. Collins, when you decided to attempt an access agreement, did you give up your longstanding claim for return or otherwise change your case with the State Department from return to access?    And, if I could, Ms. McGee, how has Japan responded to New Jersey's claim of jurisdiction in the case?    Mr. Smith. So you still maintain your earnest desire for return.    Mr. Smith. I just wanted to get that on the record.    Mr. Smith. Appreciate that.    Ms. McGee.    Mr. Smith. I think, Ms. McGee, your presence here today further underscores that whether it be a father or a mother, Japan is a haven for child abductors, notwithstanding their signature and ratification of the Hague. And maybe there are, and I do believe there are some people within the Government of Japan--I have met with some there--who are reformers and want to see systemic change.    But it seems to me that we will sharpen the mind if we do our due diligence as a country, pursuant to the Goldman Act, and get it right first with the report, and do that with every nation, not just Japan, which--where it is egregiously flawed, but also to then apply the sanctions part, which should kick in on or about August 15.    The whole idea, we followed the way we did it in the trafficking law was to have first the report, and then for some serious consideration of what the sanctions regime should look like. And so my hope is that next week, from the Department, we will not only get a report that is right, but then they will sharpen their pencils and figure out what, if anything, they should do. And I think there are some things that ought to be done vis-a-vis Japan to get their attention.    Mr. Meadows.    Mr. Smith. I will just conclude, you know, the promise of the Goldman Act remains underrealized. This is the beginning, and implementation is key. If we do find that there are needs for tweaks or upgrades for reforms, we will do it, but so far, as you pointed out, Ms. Apy, using an old standard to judge countries as opposed to the new very clear and precise standard is mind boggling, in my opinion. And I did say that to the Ambassador previously.    I do think that the key of what we are trying to do at these hearings--and there will be more, and we are trying to get more members to really get involved with this issue.    Matter of fact, one of the provisions of the Goldman Act is for the State Department to notify a Congressman or Congresswoman if, and the Senators, to give, obviously, the constituent who has the abduction against them the ability to opt in, but to tell them that having additional eyes and ears and advocacy is a good thing, get members who will speak out.    When they travel, they will raise these issues. So hopefully that is being implemented effectively. I don't know yet, but I should have asked that question earlier.    Mr. Smith. Yes, please.    Mr. Smith. Just last week.    Mr. Smith. Better late than never and hopefully that will become the norm, and everyone will get that, which I think is likely.    Yes, Ms. McGee.    Mr. Smith. If there is anything you would like to say while we conclude, but just I thought, Ms. Apy, you didn't read this, but it is in your written testimony, again, this whole issue of prioritization.    The Goldman Act--that is my word--you said ICAPRA; I don't use those words--        ``articulates Congressional intention that an         individual left-behind parent and their legal         representatives will no longer be forced to litigate         `systemic' maladies in the diplomatic relationship         between that country and the United States of America.         Once it is determined, using entirely objective         criteria, that there is a breach in the reciprocal         relationship with a Treaty partner, or there is a         systemic governmental failure to address international         parental abduction, the burden for action shifts to the         Department of State to utilize the diplomatic tools         available to it to identify and ameliorate the         problems. If they can't, when they can't, the President         of the United States has an escalating arsenal of         measured diplomatic resources to direct attention to         the problem and communicate its priority of the         American people.''I emphasize the word ``priority.'' And then you go on from there.    And that summarizes what we have tried to do with this. Hopefully, it will be effectively and aggressively implemented. That remains to be seen. And there are tests, like what do they do vis-a-vis Japan, and some of the other countries, and we will stay at it.    Thank you for your testimonies. Yes, Ms. Rutherford.    Mr. Smith. There is no one clearinghouse. Bring American Children Home, BAC Home, I should say, Bring Sean Home has a Web site where many people do go on and share best practices and what their situation is.    Mr. Smith. But in terms of one watershed type of--yes, Ms. Apy.    Mr. Smith. Zero unresolved cases, and we know of at least 50. We have two here.    Mr. Smith. A few sitting right behind you, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children testified more than 50 cases.    Mr. Smith. Well, that is what the OCI should have been doing. And one of the questions we had even before the Goldman Act was the numbers never jived. There was always one number, it would change, we would have a meeting with key people at OCI, and we would get different numbers at the meeting.    With regards to Brazil, one time I almost fell off my chair when we got two different numbers from people sitting in the room. What is it?    Mr. Smith. Well, the facts help us to----    Mr. Smith. One of the reasons not often articulated why we wanted the Goldman Act to pass was that so that more people would feel it would be an engraved invitation to use the State Department. There are cases we know nothing about. These are just reported cases that State has, and they didn't even have an accurate number of that.    And the most recent report, as we have been talking about all day today, it is not even accurate here. And, you know, that is deeply troubling. There should be no other geopolitical consideration when you are doing this report. What you do on meting out sanctions, maybe some things ought to come into play. Not on the report itself; that is foundational. So we would hope that this would be the ultimate clearinghouse.    Mr. Smith. Yes.    Mr. Smith. Thank you so very much. We will likely have a follow-up hearing in September, especially when the sanctions part kicks in, but also to ascertain what has been done on Japan, for example. And, you know, the key here would be to keep Congress, as well as the administration, focused so that we don't get the kind of egregious mistakes that were made in this report.    Again, so thank you. Your testimonies were extraordinary and extremely helpful to the Congress, and this will be widely circulated to other members. So thank you so very much.    The hearing is adjourned.
