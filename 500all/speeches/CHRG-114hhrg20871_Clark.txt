    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to the panelists for being here. And I understand that burning plasma science is just one of the areas that we have to address if we really want to deliver on fusion's promise of clean--as a clean energy source in a meaningful timescale as we look at climate change and the effects that it is having.    What--this is really a follow-up on Representative Grayson's question, but what does the United States have to do to establish leadership and accelerate the progress in plasma phasing materials research or in simulation and modeling of plasmas? For anyone.    Ms. Clark. Thank you.    Ms. Clark. Great. Thank you.    Do you have anything to offer, Dr. Hsu?    Ms. Clark. So if I understood you correctly in your testimony, you were talking about--I think you said that for the private sector a lot of these innovative technologies are too expensive to really have a meaningful investment. If we are not finding that funding in the United States, are there international competitors who are looking to fund this type of innovation?    Ms. Clark. Thank you. I see I'm out of time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
