    Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It has been interesting, as we have kind of deep dived this issue, to jump in. This would be your chance to take an extra 4 minutes as we are summing to see if, on the record, you would like to bring something up that we in Congress should be concerned about, worried about, or should take action on. So why don't we maybe start with Mr. DelBianco, and see if you have got something to add here as we conclude?    Mr. Collins. But who takes the leadership role to make sure that happens?    Mr. Collins. So, to some extent, NTIA has a veto today that is the ultimate arbiter of this? They have got a veto, and they----    Mr. Collins. For the last time? So they need to make sure they exercise that, and the community needs to make sure we in Congress know if there is something that is about to----    Mr. Collins. Right, but it is our failsafe, if you will. Would anyone else like to comment here, as we are closing out?    Mr. Collins. Yes, go ahead.    Mr. Collins. So what is the timing? If you were to say, you know, there is not a date certain, a time certain, is there? I mean, so the clock is kind of ticking, but when do you see this reaching some endpoint?    Mr. Collins. But we are talking about within a year?    Mr. Collins. Yes.    Mr. Collins. And who sets the Board? Are there going to be 20 people on the Board, and who picks them? I know how shareholders work in private corporations. This is a little bit more confusing than that.    Mr. Collins. So are we talking about 30, 40 people, 100 people?    Mr. Collins. 20ish people, and they could be replaced, I am assuming, by the nominating group? Does the NTIA get to put two people on, or nothing? Interesting. Well, I guess I have 3 seconds left or so, so I will yield that back, and thank the panelists for your dedication to this issue, which is pretty deep in the weeds, but a very important thing. So, yield back.
