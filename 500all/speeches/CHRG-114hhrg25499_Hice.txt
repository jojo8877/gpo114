    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Brennan, I think I heard this; I just want to clarify. How many employees at the Postal Service total?    Mr. Hice. Okay. What was the 7.5 million referred to twice, Ms. Lowrance, you and Mr. Rolando both.    Mr. Hice. Okay. So more or less, what, 550,000, 600,000? I didn't tally that.    Mr. Hice. Six thirty-four, okay. And yet we all understand we have got a declining industry as a whole because of a variety of factors, digital and so forth. Does the Postal Service have too many employees?    Mr. Hice. I understand that, but is it top-heavy? Do we have too many employees?    Mr. Hice. Okay. So we have 634,000 employees, we have a declining business, but you don't think we have too many employees still?    Mr. Hice. No ----    Mr. Hice. But that problem is why we have a declining business. The result of a declining business--what would a private company do? If a private company is losing money month after month, year after year, quarter after quarter, what would they do?    Mr. Hice. But we are still losing money. And I will go on. You said a few moments ago that your goal is to fill mailboxes and trucks. Is that your strategy to turn this thing around?    Mr. Hice. I would hope so.    Mr. Hice. Well, but that is what you said was your goal.    Mr. Hice. But you continue to lose money. That is the issue, and it seems rather unrealistic when you have a declining industry to think that somehow the goal of simply filling mailboxes and trucks is going to be successful in the long run.    Ms. Rectanus, you mentioned earlier that the Postal Service has been on high risk since 2009. And you summarized the reason--two basic reasons: less mail and higher salaries. Do you see an opportunity without cutting, be it the workforce or whatever, for the Postal Service to turn this around?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Well, let me springboard off of that and come back to you for my final question, Ms. Brennan. What is the Postal Service's long-term plan for addressing the declining industry?    Mr. Hice. Support what growth?    Mr. Hice. Thank you. I think it is time for the Postal Service to act as private business has to act in similar situations of constantly losing money without relying upon the taxpayer. At some point we have got to change.    Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your indulgence.
