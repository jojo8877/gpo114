    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you holding this hearing. Very important hearing.    Mr. Mattox, in your testimony you mentioned that Planned Parenthood has had great financial success in Medicaid. Unlike other Medicaid providers, they have been able to avoid some of the oversight and corrective actions that most Medicaid providers would expect. Can you elaborate on what they have been doing, and maybe what they have been getting away with all these years?    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you.    Next question. For you, Mr. Mattox: Federal law states that, quote, ``No alteration of the timing, method, or procedures used to terminate the pregnancy was made solely for the purpose of obtaining the tissue,'' end quote.    In the videos, the Planned Parenthood representative seemed to almost be boasting that they are flaunting the law. Does that seem to be the case to you? And do you think that this should be sufficient grounds to terminate Medicaid funding?    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you.    And Representative Griffith touched on this, but I want to elaborate a little bit.    Dr. Yoest, does the Planned Parenthood video show that they are willing to do partial-birth abortions in defiance to the law? Can you explain these types of abortion procedures, what they are?    Mr. Bilirakis. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
