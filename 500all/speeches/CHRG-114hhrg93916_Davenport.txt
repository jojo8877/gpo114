    Mr. Davenport. Hello. Thank you for having me here today.    In the words of David Goldman on February 27, 2014, at the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Hearing on International Parental Child Abduction,        ``My foundation has been assisting a father by the name         of Devon Davenport of North Carolina, whose daughter         Nadia was abducted to Brazil in 2009, just a few weeks         after her birth. Mr. Davenport has fought admirably to         bring Nadia home. In September 2010, a Federal court         first ordered her return to the United States. Since         then, the return order has been upheld by numerous         appeals courts and the legal case is effectively over,         yet Devon is still waiting, as I did, for Brazilian         courts to enforce their own return order and put Nadia         back on a plane to the United States. Our Government         should be demanding, not asking, that Nadia be         returned.''    I am Devon Davenport, the 28-year-old father of Nadia Lynn, and I still happen to be waiting for justice concerning her illegal abduction to Brazil some 6 years ago.    I believe that it has been made evident in the past via various testimonies from left-behind parents and politicians that the issue of international child abduction is a great concern. However, it is absurd that after the immense effort to pass Chris Smith's Goldman Act that we must convince the U.S. Department of State, the sole governmental department responsible for assisting left-behind parents, systematically navigate legally through the Hague Convention Treaty to effectively utilize the rhetoric, equipping them with necessary tools to increase resolutions for international abduction cases.    The U.S. Department of State no longer lacks the necessary tools needed in order to optimize and create an efficiently robust pipeline for handling Hague cases and distributing pertinent information between left-behind parents and central authorities from opposing countries.    Countless times throughout my 6-year legal battle, I have been the one to provide updates and ask follow-up questions in hopes of obtaining valuable information toward an actual resolution of my case. The Department of State is notorious for providing me with the exact same information I provide them with. Hardly do I ever obtain any new information, and I believe that derives from the fact that they are not proactive in their question for justice of behalf of left-behind parents.    An example is today when you asked how many cases, how many returns. They don't even know this type of information. They will get it once you prompt them, but they should have come prepared with that type of information. They should know these numbers. This is what left-behind parents deal with on a daily basis, dealing with the Department of State.    The inability and lack of foresight to initiate constructive yet progressive inquiries to the opposing central authority is not acceptable. Case officers working for the U.S. Department of State should not only be able to predict the questions and concerns of left-behind parents, but also take appropriate measures in obtaining the answers to those questions and concerns while providing feedback to those of us fighting the lengthy battle.    The reason for this inability is the lack of empathy, initiative, and urgency; no longer the tools. Herein lies the issue. Until case workers at the Department of State are able to anticipate the next steps in a given Hague case based on years of internal evidential information from various left-behind parents in each country, then there will be no progressive action taken by them to provide information that some parents never think to ask, but deserve to know, as we look to the Department of State as a source of information and mental solidarity.    Since birth in August 2008, my daughter Nadia Lynn resided with her mother, Larissa Drummond, in Cary, North Carolina. Due to parental alienation and prior threats to leave the country with my daughter to Brazil, a court order was filed and established August 20, 2008, restricting the removal of my daughter outside of the State, as well as confiscation of my daughter's passport to prevent abduction.    At the same time, a custody order was filed and signed on October 8, 2008, by District Court Judge Walczyk, and went into effect on October 14, 2008, notifying each parent that it is a felony to transport the minor child outside of the state. The court order also states that it shall remain into effect until replaced by another parenting agreement or court order pertaining to custody.    According to the signed court-ordered visitation schedule between Larissa Drummond and I, October 14, 2008, our daughter Nadia Lynn was scheduled to have visitation at my residence on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Saturdays. On Saturday, February 7, 2009, my daughter was not brought to my residence for visitation scheduled at 8 o'clock a.m.    At 8:07, I immediately contacted Larissa asking where she was. After getting no response, I contacted her mother. I then called the Cary Police Department. Upon their arrival, I provided the court-ordered visitation, and the officer and I went to Larissa's residence and found the house empty.    With knowledge of prior threats made by Larissa to leave the country with my daughter back to Brazil, we contacted the U.S. Department of State to inquire about a possible abduction and were informed that I would receive a call on Monday, February 9, 2009, from the abduction officer who handles cases to Brazil, who happened to be Ms. Daisy Cardiel at the time. Soon after, I received from NCMEC a protocol number for my daughter, as well as a kidnapping case number for my daughter.    There was a court order calendared by Wake County Courthouse to have my name added to my daughter's birth certificate. On February 10, 2009, I filed to have an emergency order granting me sole legal and physical custody of my daughter Nadia, as well as immediate return of her back to her habitual residence in North Carolina, which Judge Walczyk signed on February 12, 2009.    April 20, 2009, the Department of State emailed me saying, ``The Brazilian Central Authority would like me to inform you that your case was sent to Interpol on 2009, April 2. Furthermore, despite the fact that the child has not been located, the Brazilian Central Authority sent the file to the Federal Attorney's Office in order to commence an analysis on your case.''    April 19, 2009, I receive a message on the Bring Sean Home Foundation forum from a 21-year-old law student asking me about information on my daughter and the mother. I provided the last name, first name, and possible state that my daughter would be in. Eight days later he provides me with the address of my daughter in Brazil, while it had taken Interpol and the FBI, what, 4 months. They still hadn't found her.    I provided this information to the U.S. Department of State May 6, 2009. It took them 3 months later to confirm the address that I provided them.    April 14, 2010, I arrived in Brazil for the first instance hearing on the international abduction of my daughter Nadia Lynn. September 14, 2010, I received a favorable ruling, which issued the return of Nadia back to the United States. I was ordered to spend a 15-day transition period in Brazil before returning. During this transition period, the mother filed an appeal, ultimately suspending the return as well as the transition period between Nadia and I, on September 26, 2010.    November 30, 2011, the TRF Federal Court of Brazil rejected the mother's appeal by a majority panel. She appealed again within the Federal Court. March 23, 2012, the Federal judge upheld the first instance court order for the return of Nadia back to the United States. The mother filed another appeal to the Superior and Supreme courts.    May 21, 2012, Special Advisor for Children's Issues, Ambassador Susan Jacobs, spoke to the Brazilian Central Authority directly and requested that my case be expedited and expressed her concerns on the delays and appeals that my case has received. April 11, 2013, TRF President rejected the appeal filed by the mother before the STJ and STF. And I was told that the request for the enforcement of my daughter to return back to the United States will be filed on April 30. It was not.    August 14, 2013, Ambassador Susan Jacobs and Scott Renner traveled to Brasilia, Brazil, to speak directly with proper personnel to have my case expedited and ruled on. However, I received no official report on this meeting. I have no clue what was discussed, with whom the discussion occurred, and what the outcome of said meeting was, although I was told that I would receive a formal detailed summary within 3 weeks. I was never sent that information.    August 27, 2013, a hearing at the first instance court in Criciuma was scheduled in which the charge of the enforcement order would decide the logistics of the return. Instead, they postponed this, and the appeal was dismissed at the STJ Court in Brasilia, Brazil. September 6, 2013, the appeal was dismissed by the sitting judge at the STJ Court in Brasilia. Being that it was a monocrotic decision, the mother appealed again.    September 27, 2013, the Brazilian Central Authority and OAG filed a motion on the first instance court for the temporary execution of the enforcement order. This was a request that the judge not wait until the appeals were decided upon. The judge was to formally respond to this motion with a decision.    October 11, 2013, I was informed that my case would be heard on October 17. It wasn't. October 17, instead of ruling on the appeal, it was removed from the agenda.    April 14, 2013, the STJ and STF appeals to the return order were rejected by the TRF president and were yet again appealed only once again to be dismissed by the STJ on September 10, 2013, ultimately allowing Nadia to return to the United States once and for all following a 15-day transition period in Brazil set to occur in 2014.    June 17, 2014, I traveled to Brazil to complete the 15-day transition period with my daughter, with the expectation to return home once and for all to the United States. Upon arrival to Brazil, I was immediately served with another appeal stating the transition period and the return order had been suspended by a last-minute injunction filed by the taking parent. I was able to have the suspension of the transition period overturned. However, the courts are still pending a ruling on the suspension of the return order at the STJ.    December 15, 2014, Minister Rosa Weber of the STF Court ruled in a monocrotic decision to dismiss the special appeal. January 23, 2015, the taking parent filed a motion for clarification on the dismissal of the special appeal, a well-known delay tactic. January 28, 2015, I called the STF and asked that Minister Rosa Weber decide on this case as quickly as possible, and to note the constant delay tactics being used by the taking parent.    On February 11, 2015, I received an email from the Department of State stating that the ministers at the STF converted the mother's declaratory motion to an agravo regimental. According to the OAG, this is a good sign, as it shows a tactic from the court to accelerate the process.    March 4, 2015, the special appeal of the STF was finally rejected. However, the taking parent continues to use delay tactics in order to prevent the inevitable return for my daughter back to the United States by filing yet another motion for clarification.    I am here today not to ask, but to demand, that my daughter Nadia be returned immediately to the United States without delay. This case has literally taken its legal course and justice is now overdue.    I want to thank you for your time, and I hope that my daughter Nadia will soon be returned to the United States and her habitual residence, once and for all.    Thank you.    Mr. Davenport. Yes.    Mr. Davenport. As far as Brazil is concerned, and I know you have a lot of experience with Brazil in helping David Goldman, as far as I know no other children have really been returned successfully via the Hague. And we know what it took for Sean to return. And when you think about that effort and the immense amount of pressure that was necessary to be placed on Brazil for Sean to return, whose mother died, you know, it is crazy to assume that they would return a child whose mother is still alive.    Without the same or more pressure from Congress and the United States, I believe that my case--for example, I have gone through the entire process, I mean, with every appeal that can be filed has been filed. It is essentially over, and my daughter is still over there. There is no enforcement.    So you have a situation where you can win a case, and I am pretty sure the Department of State will call that a resolution or a soft case. But the actual child has not literally been returned to the habitual residence. And that is the essential goal of the Hague Convention Treaty, to actually have that child returned.    And so until children are coming home, and it is still boggles me that they don't know a number, or know no numbers. It is all ``I will get back to you.'' I think that goes to show that there really probably aren't any cases where you can literally say a child has traveled from the country of abduction back to the country of origin.    Mr. Davenport. I would just like to say that sanctions are absolutely necessary, especially for countries that are non-compliant. And the risk of diplomacy is definitely necessary to apply that to these countries in order to bring the children back.    One instance will set an example, and maybe threats from there on out will be enough. But you have to make good on a sanction, at least one time, at least bring a child home. Sean Goldman is the only one I know of.    Thanks.
