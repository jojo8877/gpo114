    Dr. Wright. Chairwoman Walorski, Ranking Member McGovern, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the honor to testify on the Bluegrass Double Dollars Pilot Program, a project supported by the USDA Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Program, or FINI. And a special thank you to my fellow witnesses for sharing their important work. My name is Ashton Wright, and I have the unique responsibility of serving as the City of Lexington, Kentucky's first local food coordinator. I manage Bluegrass Farm to Table, a program that supports food related agricultural development, and the improvement of nutritional health in the region. In today's testimony, I will highlight the work happening in Lexington around nutrition incentive programs, work that was established by pilot funding from FINI.    I work in partnership with Bluegrass Community Foundation to implement our Double Dollars Program, which aims to improve access to healthy, affordable, locally grown produce for low-income individuals participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Simultaneously, the program strives to strengthen Kentucky's farm economy by increasing the demand for locally grown produce. Based on our pilot project experience, we have identified three ways to strengthen the FINI program. One, encourage strong multi-sector partnerships. Two, increase coordination and collaboration with state SNAP offices. And three, develop a community of practice for FINI grantees.    To provide context, one in five Kentucky residents participates in SNAP. Additionally, our region faces the dichotomy of food insecurity and high rates of obesity. Increasing produce consumption is a documented strategy to help reduce many of the health outcomes associated with obesity. Two of the critical barriers to the purchase and consumption of fresh produce among low-income Lexington residents is lack of access and affordability. Bluegrass Double Dollars aims to reduce these barriers.    Specifically, our program allow SNAP participants to double their purchasing power to buy locally grown produce at three pilot locations, a farmers' market, a cooperatively owned grocery store, and a corner market. The program provides incentives for Kentucky grown produce, coupled with targeted community outreach and education to help SNAP participants become more familiar with, and more willing to purchase, locally grown produce. According to our evaluation data, 90 percent of respondents said that the program encouraged them to purchase more locally grown produce. In the first 6 months of our pilot, the average redemption rate of our incentive vouchers was nearly 80 percent, and the total value of double dollars redeemed for Kentucky grown produce was over $15,000, a win-win for SNAP recipients and Kentucky farmers. This last year we have learned that there is tremendous value in partnering with the Federal Government on nutrition incentive programs. It demonstrates commitment to promoting healthy eating and reducing food insecurity. Because our pilot demonstrates the benefits of healthy eating and supporting local farmers, it allows us to partner and leverage support with stakeholders and funders in both the health and agriculture sectors.    From our experience, we recommend the Committee consider providing USDA with an increase of resources to implement the following three recommendations. First, we recommend that strong multi-sector partnerships be encouraged in an effort to develop sustainable incentive programs that encourage healthy eating among SNAP participants. FINI provides a unique opportunity for building stronger partnerships between the food security and local agriculture sectors by prioritizing projects that incentivize locally sourced produce. Future Federal initiatives should build on this momentum to improve access to healthy, affordable produce, while also strengthening local food economies.    Second, we recommend a more comprehensive approach to educating SNAP recipients about where they can use their SNAP benefits. Specifically, we recommend incentivizing state and local SNAP offices to work collaboratively with grantees to help educate SNAP participants about where they can purchase produce with their benefits, and encourage them to take advantage of these incentive programs, like Bluegrass Double Dollars. Cultivating this buy-in from state and local SNAP offices is critical to the future success of programs like     Third, in the spirit of maximizing the impact of Federal dollars, we recommend that USDA develop a community of practice for organizations implementing incentive programs through FINI to share best practices and lessons learned. This peer-to-peer technical assistance network would streamline the development of resources on which all FINI grantees are working, including technology development, logistics, and education. Fostering this multi-sector collaboration will maximize the impact of the Federal investment in this program.    I look forward to working with the Subcommittee, and my colleagues, to build on the momentum FINI has established to bridge the gap between the important work of reducing food insecurity and strengthening local food economies. And again, I sincerely thank the Chairwoman, Ranking Member McGovern, and members of the staff and Subcommittee for the opportunity to share our lessons learned from the field today.    Prepared Statement of Ashton Potter Wright, Ph.D., Local Food   Coordinator, Bluegrass Farm to Table, Office of the Mayor, City of                        Lexington, Lexington, KYImproving Access to Healthy Food and Supporting Local Food Systems         through the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) ProgramIntroduction    Subcommittee Chairwoman Walorski, Ranking Member McGovern, and Members of the Subcommittee on Nutrition, it is an honor to be here to testify on the Bluegrass Double Dollars Pilot Program--a project supported by the USDA Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) program. Thank you for the opportunity to share what we have learned from our pilot project relating to food insecurity, nutrition, economic development, and public-private partnerships. And a special thank you to my fellow witnesses for sharing their strategies to reduce food insecurity through the implementation of nutrition incentive programs.    I manage Bluegrass Farm to Table, an initiative of the City of Lexington's Office of Economic Development. Bluegrass Farm to Table serves as a mechanism to increase coordination and collaboration among stakeholders at all levels of the local food system--from production to consumption--and to improve the nutritional health in the region. FINI presents an incredible opportunity to tackle both of these priorities. In partnership with Blue Grass Community Foundation, Bluegrass Farm to Table manages the Bluegrass Double Dollars Pilot Program funded by FINI. Bluegrass Double Dollars aims to improve access to affordable, locally grown produce for low-income individuals participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Simultaneously, Bluegrass Double Dollars strives to stimulate Kentucky's farm economy by increasing the demand for locally grown fruits and vegetables.    Based on our experience as a FINI pilot project recipient, we recommend that the Committee provide USDA with an increase of resources to:  <bullet> encourage stronger multi-sector partnerships;  <bullet> increase coordination and collaboration with state SNAP         offices; and  <bullet> develop a community of practice for FINI grantees.Background    One in five Kentucky residents (828,000) participates in SNAP--the majority of whom are children, elderly, or the disabled. 16.4% of all households are considered food-insecure.\1\ Additionally, Kentucky has the 5th highest prevalence of obesity in the nation (prevalence = 33.2%).\2\ High rates of obesity correlate with high rates of chronic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and certain cancers. Therefore, it is imperative to continue to find solutions to address these problems, particularly among low-income and food-insecure individuals.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    \1\ Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis of data from USDA Food and Nutrition Service, FY 2013.    \2\ ``The State of Obesity: Better Policies for a Healthier America'' from Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2014.---------------------------------------------------------------------------    A documented strategy to help reduce many of the aforementioned chronic health conditions is to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables. However, low-income individuals are often unable to locate, purchase, and prepare healthier food items. Two of the critical barriers to the purchase and consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables among low-income Lexington residents are the lack of access and affordability. Specifically, access is particularly problematic for low-income individuals who live in the pockets of food deserts where fresh fruit and vegetables are not available. The fresh fruits and vegetables that are available, particularly those that are locally grown, are often too expensive for low-income individuals to purchase. The Bluegrass Double Dollars program aims to reduce these barriers.    Kentucky enjoys a rich agricultural history, largely steeped in tobacco production. Over time, farmers have begun to transition to vegetable production. Most farms in Kentucky are small (under 50 acres) and depend on direct-to-consumer markets to sustain their farm enterprises. With a ready and growing supply of local produce and other farm products, many of these small to medium-sized producers are eager to grow their customer base and welcome the opportunity to partner with programs, such as Bluegrass Double Dollars.Bluegrass Double Dollars Pilot Program    The Bluegrass Double Dollars program is a collaborative public-private partnership between Bluegrass Farm to Table and Blue Grass Community Foundation. The program is designed to make local produce more accessible to SNAP participants in the Lexington area while expanding the market for local food producers. Specifically, the program allows SNAP beneficiaries to double their purchasing power to buy locally grown fruits and vegetables at three pilot sites--a farmers' market, a cooperatively owned grocery store, and a corner store. The program provides incentives for Kentucky-grown produce coupled with targeted community outreach and education to help SNAP participants become more familiar with and more willing to purchase locally-grown produce. According to our pilot project evaluation data, 90% of respondents said the Bluegrass Double Dollars program encouraged them to purchase more locally grown fruits and vegetables and that they would be more likely to shop at venues where they know the program will be offered.    This collaborative economic initiative is focused on supporting both Kentucky SNAP participants and Kentucky farmers. In the first 6 months of our pilot, the average redemption rate of our incentive vouchers was nearly 80%, and the total value of Double Dollars redeemed for Kentucky grown produce was just over $15,000--a win-win for SNAP recipients and Kentucky farmers. The pilot program has gained momentum as participation and redemption have increased nearly each month the program has been in place.Value of FINI    The Food Insecurity Nutrition Assistance Program represents a unique opportunity to meet the two primary goals of Bluegrass Farm to Table-supporting food-related agricultural development and the improvement of nutritional health in the region. The architects of FINI should be commended for providing multiple levels of funding (pilots, projects, and large-scale projects) to develop programs with varying scales and scopes as opposed to taking a one-size-fits-all approach. The pilot funding parameters afforded our planning team in Lexington a great deal of flexibility when designing and implementing our incentive program.    There is tremendous value in nonprofits partnering with the Federal Government on incentive programs such as FINI. It demonstrates that the Federal Government is committed to promoting healthy eating and reducing food insecurity. Having the FINI pilot project grant also allows us to leverage support and buy-in from partner organizations to help sustain the Bluegrass Double Dollars program. Because our pilot demonstrates the benefits of healthy eating and supporting local farmers, it allows us to partner with stakeholders and funders in both the health and agriculture sectors.Lessons Learned and Recommendations from the Field    FINI provides a strong foundation for developing sustainable incentive programs to improve healthy eating among food-insecure individuals. It also provides a unique opportunity to support local food producers. To build on this momentum and to improve future iterations of the program, we recommend that the Committee provide USDA with an increase in resources to:  <bullet> Encourage strong multi-sector partnerships;  <bullet> Increase coordination and collaboration with state SNAP         offices; and  <bullet> Develop a community of practice for FINI grantees.Encourage Strong Multi-Sector Partnerships    Strong multi-sector partnerships should be encouraged in an effort to develop holistic and sustainable incentive programs that encourage healthy eating among SNAP recipients. The FINI program provides a unique opportunity for building stronger partnerships between the food security and local agriculture sectors because it gives preference to projects that incentivize locally or regionally sourced produce. Future Federal opportunities should build on this momentum. Practitioners working on food security and local food systems should be challenged to work with one another to develop creative and sustainable solutions that improve access to healthy, affordable, local food while stimulating the local and regional food economies. Increased synergy between these two sectors has the potential to maximize funding, leverage existing resources, and foster multi-sector collaboration.    Bluegrass Farm to Table and its partner organizations were thrilled to see FINI as a provision in the Agriculture Act of 2014 (Farm Bill) because it allows for increased collaboration between organizations working to address food insecurity and those working to build strong local food economies. The key multi-sector partners involved in Bluegrass Double Dollars include: a community foundation, a cooperatively owned grocery store, a farmers' market, a corner store located in a food desert, Cooperative Extension/SNAP Education Staff, and the University of Kentucky's College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment.Increased Coordination and Collaboration with State/Local SNAP Offices    A more comprehensive approach to educating SNAP recipients about where they can use their SNAP benefits, particularly places that routinely offer healthy, locally produced food is needed. Specifically, we recommend that future FINI requests for proposals incentivize state and local SNAP offices to work collaboratively with FINI grantees to help educate SNAP beneficiaries about where they can use their SNAP benefits for the purchase of produce and encourage them to take advantage of incentive programs such as Bluegrass Double Dollars. We heard stories from program participants that it was not until they heard about the Bluegrass Double Dollars Program that they realized they could even use their SNAP benefits at the farmers' market and the cooperatively owned grocery store. We recognize that educating SNAP users about locations where they can take advantage of the incentive program is an integral component of the program; therefore, we will continue to invest in education and outreach aimed at a wider audience of SNAP users in the Lexington.    Because state and local SNAP offices are tasked with the responsibility of issuing and managing benefits, beneficiaries view them as a trusted source of information. If state and local SNAP offices are incentivized to make healthy eating, especially from local and regional markets, an internal priority, SNAP recipients will be encouraged to use their benefits for locally grown produce, which directly benefits local farm economies. Because all SNAP beneficiaries come into contact with their state and/or local office while participating in the program, partnering with these offices is a much more efficient way to ensure that all possible beneficiaries are receiving pertinent information related to available incentive programs than grantee organizations operating alone. Cultivating this buy-in from state and local SNAP offices is critical to the future success of programs like FINI.Develop a Community of Practice for FINI Grantees    In the spirit of maximizing Federal dollars and minimizing redundancy, we recommend that the USDA develop a community of practice for organizations implementing incentive programs through FINI to share best practices and lessons learned on a regular and recurring basis. This peer-to-peer technical assistance network would streamline the development of resources on which all FINI grantees are working, including technology development, logistics, and education.    Developing the appropriate technology to issue and redeem incentives is time and resource intensive. Our pilot, and likely others, would benefit tremendously from utilizing a standardized technology platform that could be easily tailored to different types of venues (farmers' markets, retail establishments, etc.) while allowing for streamlined incentive issuance, redemption, and reporting/data collection. It is our understanding that several of the programs that have been implementing incentive programs have experimented with various types of technological applications, yet none have found a tool that works well for both farmers' market and retail settings. Working collaboratively in a community of practice to develop such a tool would be tremendously valuable.    Currently, there is no incentive for grant recipients to work together. Establishing a community of practice would ensure that Federal resources are being maximized in the most efficient manner. Additionally, because many of the pilot projects involve unique partnerships, it would benefit the entire group to learn from and collaborate with organizations from different sectors. Increased coordination and collaboration among government entities, nonprofits, and the private sector could have tremendous positive implications for the success of SNAP incentive programs.Conclusion    In conclusion, while the FINI program provides us with the opportunity to bridge the gap between the important work of reducing food insecurity and stimulating local food systems, more work remains to ensure that future funding opportunities encourage strong multi-sector partnerships; coordination and collaboration with state/local SNAP Offices, and the development of a community of practice for FINI grantees. Again, I sincerely thank Chairwoman Walorski, Ranking Member McGovern, and Members of the Subcommittee for providing me with the opportunity to share our lessons learned from the field.    The Chairwoman. Thank you, Dr. Wright. Ms. Kiley, we are thrilled to have you today, and you can proceed with your testimony.    Dr. Wright. Absolutely. I would say our pilot is unique because it is the Municipality of Lexington partnering with our very successful community foundation in Lexington. So we both kind of bring really a unique partnership together, so melding those partnerships was critical. And it allowed us, with the FINI money, to leverage just over $10,000 in public and private money through the community foundation's networks, and through local ag and health sectors as well.    The Chairwoman. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Mr. McGovern.    Dr. Wright. So I will just make a couple of quick points. I do think Lexington is a population center surrounded by a really interesting mix of rural communities. And so often in Lexington, SNAP shoppers and just Lexington residents, there is a big disconnect between the food they purchase at the farmers' market, or the grocery store, and where that food is produced. I think the FINI program, for us, allows us to bridge that gap, and helps educate SNAP users by using farmers as that tool to educate them. My farm is 15 miles away, I picked it this morning, here is how you can prepare it. Farmers' markets represent a really unique opportunity to get at that issue.    I will say another challenge that we have identified that you spoke to about in our urban center, transportation to the venues where these incentive programs are being offered is a huge barrier. Getting folks to the farmers' market, and to the cooperatively owned grocery store. So we are partnering with our Health Department on a funding mechanism they received to provide vouchers for transportation to get folks to these markets.    Dr. Wright. Sure. So, really, our fundraising efforts, aside from FINI, really started at the grassroots level, so it really started on a smaller scale, targeting interested bodies of individuals who may be supportive of programs like this. So we partnered with local restaurants to do some interesting fundraising with them, donating a percentage of their purchases to the Double Dollars Program. We did some community outreach activities at some of the venues, like the farmers' market. We did an unlimited doubling event, and actually did a watermelon sampling that day, and asked for donations. So patrons at the farmers' market who were regular shoppers could have the opportunity to donate there.    So it really started with that grassroots level. That, coupled with the FINI money allowed us to approach larger organizations, like our Farm Credit agency, and health care organizations. So we kind of started at the grass roots, and are slowly building to approach larger funders.    Dr. Wright. Yes, they certainly are. So that program is coordinated through our Department of Agriculture. The current farmers' market that we are partnering with as a part of our pilot is a little unique in that there is one EBT terminal for the entire market. There are other markets in----    Dr. Wright. That is correct. They will contact the market--there is a booth with the market manager. They come and swipe their EBT for all purchases, regardless of the incentive or not. So the EBT dollars are transferred into tokens, and then the incentive tokens are also given at that same time, so the SNAP participants can use those tokens at any vendor at the market.    Dr. Wright. How they wish, yes.    On SNAP eligible items, yes, certainly.    Dr. Wright. Yes. Our doubling is a little bit unique too, is that our incentives are only for Kentucky grown produce. So at our farmers' market there is----    Dr. Wright. We do love Illinois, but part of my job, obviously, is supporting Kentucky farmers, so----    Dr. Wright. Sure. So, at the Lexington Farmers' Market, one of our pilot sites, the way it works, a SNAP user would come up to the market tent, swipe their EBT card for however much they wanted to swipe for, and then they would double up to $10, explicitly, for Kentucky grown produce. The stigma issue is a really interesting one, and our farmers' market also provides tokens for non-EBT transactions. So if you want to use your debit card at the farmers' market, you could go and swipe your debit card. You would also get tokens. They look a little bit differently, but to the casual observer, they look like tokens. So the stigma issue hasn't really been a challenge for us, but certainly appreciate that that is a challenge in other areas.    I do think having the one point of sale at the market manager booth, as opposed to each individual farmer having their own equipment right now, given our parameters, is the way to go. However, I am very excited about the development of this app, and I think that that could definitely streamline our process in Lexington.    Dr. Wright. Yes.    Dr. Wright. It wasn't in our ground level pilot application, but we certainly have been exploring. We did some outreach to those communities to make sure that they were hearing about the incentive program. But, again, that goes back to the challenge of transportation, and some of these other issues. So we are looking forward to partnering with our local Health Department in this upcoming cycle to really get at that transportation issue, and educate folks about where they can use their benefits.    Dr. Wright. Thank you for that question. Our Bluegrass Community Foundation and Bluegrass Farm to Table have been reaching out to our state SNAP office to start this dialogue about how they, and our local SNAP offices, can be more involved in the education process about these incentive programs. We really feel like it is critical to build that capacity at the state and local level, because really they are the front line, and they have the potential to touch every SNAP recipient in the communities that we are working in. And so if they are on the front lines, in the trenches with us, helping to educate folks about where they can use their benefits, where they can access these incentive programs, that is a really, really important tool to have. And so we hope, in Lexington, to engage with both our state and local office to improve that communication and that dialogue
