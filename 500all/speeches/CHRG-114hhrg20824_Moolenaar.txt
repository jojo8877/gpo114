    Mr. Moolenaar. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I want to thank all of you for being with us here today and for your testimony.    And I wanted to follow up on some of the things that have been discussed. One is in the area of coordinated research you mentioned, both long-term research, you know, market acceptance, coordinated roadmaps, strategic plan. It seems like those themes keep coming up. And then there's also the coordinated framework for the regulation of biotechnology that hasn't been updated since 1992. And I'm assuming the memo--the White House memo was instructing that that would be updated. Is that correct?    Who--I've heard different agencies mentioned, the EPA, USDA, FDA. Who is the point on that? Is there one agency that the convener in that? Dr. Maxon?    Mr. Moolenaar. And are you all giving input to that process? Do you feel like you're at the table discussing that with them?    Mr. Moolenaar. Okay. And then what's the timing on--would it be a new rule, a new regulation, a framework that comes out and then there'd be a public comment period after that framework comes out?    Mr. Moolenaar. Okay. Any others have any comment on that?    Mr. Moolenaar. And is the framework the same as the strategic plan or is that totally different?    Mr. Moolenaar. Okay.    Mr. Moolenaar. And then who is driving the strategic plan?    Mr. Moolenaar. Okay. Dr. Evans, did you have a comment on that?    Mr. Moolenaar. Okay. Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you for your insights.    Chairwoman Comstock. I now recognize Congressman Abraham.
