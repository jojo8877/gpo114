    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Ron, why do you believe preventing perimeter breaches should be a top priority?    Mr. Walberg. In your testimony you mentioned perimeter breaches. You mentioned a wheel well situation, but why do you believe perimeter breaches should be a top priority?    Mr. Walberg. Kind of negates all the effort then. Do you think that TSA is taking theinsider-outsider threat seriously?    Mr. Walberg. So the coordination is out of whack as well with the resources. Let me just move on. I'm asking each of you to respond to this question. Do you believe TSA overprescribes technological solutions and fails to think creatively about airport security?    Mr. Walberg. Ms. Grover, could you respond?    Mr. Walberg. Are we looking imagination and creativity?    Mr. Walberg. Mr. Roth.    Mr. Walberg. I guess my concern is as I've traveled through Detroit and Washington most generally, I see TSA agents attempting to perform their functions in most cases with courtesy, doing their jobs as it's clear they have been told to do. But I just wonder if there aren't some great ideas that could come from TSA agents themselves that people like Mr. Carraway and others aren't willing to listen to or aren't given time to listen to, on how to deal with our passengers and our security risk, which includes the perimeter. Because they hear about it just like us and know for a fact that all that they've done at the PreCheck line or the general line can be taken out of any type of positive results simply because we haven't looked at all the places we could go.    So thank you for your testimony. I see my time is expired. I yield back.
