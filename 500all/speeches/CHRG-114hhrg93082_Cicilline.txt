    Mr. Cicilline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our witnesses. I first want to begin by thanking the many victims of asbestos injury and illness who are here and have taken time out of their lives to be part of this hearing. Thank you for being present today, and I hope that we will act consistent with the experiences you have had, and do the right thing, and defeat this bill.    I want to say to you, Mr. Inselbuch, thank you for your testimony, and for its clarity, and for giving us a really important context. And I apologize to witnesses. I have been in and out. I am in the middle of another hearing, but wanted to come back for a couple of purposes.    First, I would ask, Mr. Chairman, unanimous consent that a letter from the Military Order of the Purple Heart be introduced as part of the record; a letter from the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization Voice of the Victims be made a part of the record; correspondence from the American Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO; a letter from AFSCME, the American Federation of State County Municipal Employees; Public Citizen; the Environmental Working Group; a letter from asbestos patients and their families; and a letter from Douglas Campbell of Campbell & Levine.    Mr. Cicilline. Mr. Inselbuch, I want to ask you, Mr. Scarcella said that individual trusts operate in vacuums. Can you explain why this is not the case?    Mr. Cicilline. Would you also tell me, Mr. Inselbuch, how trusts evaluate demands for payments specifically to prevent fraud and abuse, and whether or not the system under which that process is undertaken is sufficient to avoid or deter fraud?    Mr. Cicilline. And just one final question. Can you explain why trusts treat claimant submissions as confidential? And conversely, can you explain why the defendant corporations demand that their settlements be kept confidential?    Mr. Cicilline. Thank you. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
