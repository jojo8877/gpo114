    Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And I want to thank the Secretary for the extraordinary service that she has provided to the Nation. Having spent a great deal of time in the private sector to take on this role at this time I know is a major sacrifice but has helped our country.    So we now have 59 months of straight consecutive job growth and over the last 11 months, we have seen job growth of 200,000 or above each month. And we hope that when the February numbers are made public that we will continue to see this trend moving in the right direction.    This country, this economy in which you are the chief custodian for has generated more jobs than the rest of the developed world combined. And so you have done a great job under some challenging circumstances.    We welcome you to the committee. And I know that my colleagues on the other side always talk about dynamic scoring. In your case, it is kind of like dynamic investing. If we invest in job growth, we can reap the rewards. And we look forward to hearing about your budget request. Thank you.    Mr. Fattah. Well, let me first of all, Madam Secretary, ask you about the manufacturing initiative. One of my priorities on the subcommittee over the last few years that I have been the ranking member has been the MEP program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the Hollings legacy around manufacturing extension using the same basic method that was used in the agriculture extension to apply to our manufacturers.    Now, we have seen arrested by this Administration the major losses that we were seeing in this sector. In fact, I recall in the first weeks of the Administration economists aggregated together on the pages of the New York Times saying how this could not work and manufacturing could not come back.    And the Administration has shown that this was a fallacy, that in truth manufacturing has led the recovery. And you said it is 800,000 jobs, but there is more for us to do. And I have talked to you about this.    I am particularly interested in how this intersects with the other work of our subcommittee because we invest in science. And the chairman and I have a great interest in science.    But I am interested to make sure that American innovation, that is American ideas are connected to American jobs, that when we have the spinoffs from our space program and other programs in which intellectual property is allowed to be used mainly for free by companies to create wealth that we require in the licensing of this intellectual property that whatever jobs it created are created in the United States of America.    And the committee has done some work in this area in the past, and I have a continuing interest to make sure that where we invest in a national lab, where we invest in NIST or NASA or NOAA that when there are new widgets that those widgets get manufactured whether in Texas or Pennsylvania or some other place, California, New York, and Washington State.    But the point here is that there is no reason why taxpayer-financed research, even though it may create wealth for some innovators, and I think that is wonderful, I am all for it, but that the jobs that go with it should benefit Americans and the Americans that we are taxing to make the initial investment into science.    So if you could talk a little bit about that, that would be helpful.    Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Madam Secretary.    I saw the red light come on and I think that----    Mr. Fattah . Means that--no--that I will wait until the next round to ask a follow-up. No, we are going to try to follow the rules.    Mr. Fattah. Could the gentle lady introduce the young one?    Mr. Fattah. Well I am sure the chairman and the ranking member will be glad to go with you----    Mr. Fattah . Allocation if you got the chairman some cigars, you know what I mean? I hear that, Judge, I am sorry.    Mr. Fattah. That is correct. And I have one ten-second area.    Mr. Fattah. Do you want me to go first?    Mr. Fattah. As we discussed when we met, I am very interested in working with you to pursue the neurotechnology sector as an industry. I am going to be in Israel next week, in Tel Aviv, at the BrainTech Israel Conference. But there is a growing industry internationally, but America leads, and we should continue to focus on how to develop these businesses focused on brain related health issues. And I look forward to an opportunity as you indicated for us to put together some of the industry representatives with you to talk about what we can do as a country to work in this space. All right? Thank you very much.    Mr. Fattah. No. But I do think on this Internet matter, just so we can get some clarity at some point, we should just do a meeting and have a briefing----    Mr. Fattah . So that all of us can understand exactly what is going on. Because I think----    Mr. Fattah. Right. So that we can----    Mr. Fattah. Right. Yes.    Mr. Fattah. But the chairman's offices will arrange it. But we will----    Mr. Fattah . Just have a meeting, not a hearing, and get to the details.    Mr. Fattah. I want to thank the chairman for hosting you and this hearing is an important part of our decision-making process. So I want to say a number of things.    One is that you have a distinction, you know, in terms of not just your service at NOAA but as one of the first women astronauts and walking in space, so you are an important example of the impact science can have in the life of our Nation.    NOAA is a critically important agency and I have been over to visit at the National Weather Service. I got a chance to keynote or talk at the conference that was held on severe weather events. We have a lot going on not just in terms of your normal work but the challenges related to weather and the historic high in terms of severe weather events.    The work that NOAA has done to make advancements in weather forecasting has helped save lives and protect property throughout the country, and also it is critically important for navigating our waters for commerce and for troop deployments. We need information through NOAA. And the work of the Administration to create an ocean policy, I think, has been very important.    I was at their coastal zone conference in Chicago a few years back where I got a chance to speak, but more importantly to learn about the important efforts of NOAA all the way to and including the Guard Club of America and their tremendous support. They were just here on The Hill a few weeks ago talking to Members and making it abundantly clear these 11,000 volunteers, how important your work is.    So I want to welcome you. Look forward to your testimony.    And I thank the chairman. And, again, I apologize for being a couple minutes late. But I was with Tom Cole and he said he would give me a slip if I needed one. But we were trying to conclude work on Labor HHS. So thank you, Chair.    Mr. Fattah. All right.    Mr. Fattah. Well, conclude today's activities, yes.    Mr. Fattah. I think it was Dr. Harris, Bernard Harris who wrote the book Dream Walker, and it talks about walking in space. And he said that when you are out there and you are facing earth, it is warmer. And when you are facing away, it is colder.    I hope you know it is warm in here. When you are here, we want to help you do what you want to do and what you need to do on behalf of the country.    And the work of NOAA, this satellite gap that the chairman raised, as we know, because the committee looked at this early on, this was set in place well before your tenure, well before this Administration came into being. But it is a problem that we have to help solve.    And as you say that the best-case scenario is for the life of the existing satellite to move as well as it can within the probabilities of some type of failure, catastrophic or otherwise, until the new satellite can launch, but in terms of going forward in terms of not being--I guess there are two sides of this.    One is the satellite repair, you know, the need for funding, and we funded this in NASA, some effort to start to look at how we can extend lives of existing satellites, because we got a lot of satellites floating around out there.    But also your point is correctly taken which is that one of the things the committee can do even as we look at this in the rearview mirror, this gap that none of us had anything to do with, is to make sure that we do not repeat the same mistake and that we forward fund and take the necessary steps to make sure that--because these satellites are critical to our weather.    And as I understand when we talk about severe weather events, these billion dollar plus events, our ability to project where these incidents are going to take place has improved dramatically and, therefore, our warning systems in terms of moving people, we have saved lives and also because we know more about what is going to happen, we are in just a much better position. So it is a worthwhile investment.    And I know that the committee did some work in terms of tsunami warning systems and maybe you could talk to us about where we are with the investments that we have made there and whether there is any additional work we need to do in that trade space.    Mr. Fattah. I would love the chairman to hear this.    Mr. Fattah. It is okay.    It is important that you just make sure you get this so the chairman can hear.    Mr. Fattah. Thank you very much.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Fattah. Well, there are a few fishermen and women in the New England area too. I know there is a lot of interest in these catch share things.    Mr. Fattah. So we would be glad to participate.    Mr. Fattah. Well, the issue there is whether you are going with the natural hatcheries or--and you have got a lot going on up there in Washington State.    Mr. Fattah. To go closer to your own work, in part, earlier in your career, one of the budget items is something around $150 million for a new vessel. Can you talk to us about the import of this and what it would be used for?    Mr. Fattah. One other question. The other budget item is a $3 million increase, this is a partnership in part with Brazil and the Air Force on a radio oscillation weather satellite.    Mr. Fattah. Yes, COSMIC-2, yes. Yes, I am sorry.    Mr. Fattah. Mr. Chairman, let me just put on the record that you provide a lot of services but you do not, unlike some of our economic competitors we do not charge for these services, weather services, other information that's provided to the private sector, companies like AccuWeather, and to benefit you know all of our T.V. stations and others benefit from this service that is provided through the National Weather Service. And you also provide navigation information to, for navigation of the seas, and so on. Do you, in terms of the work that you do, there is a lot of benefit to the American, to American enterprise. If you could just spend a minute just talking about how NOAA has an impact on our economy? I guess is the way I would phrase it, generally.    Mr. Fattah. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I am not arguing that we change it. I just wanted to make sure that we make the point, that it is different from, say, you know, Germany, or other countries, where this information is sold.    Mr. Fattah. Right. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Fattah. And if the chairman would yield----    Mr. Fattah . Let me also add that it has been an absolute pleasure to work with you and we have gotten a lot done together and helped a great many people. So thank you and we wish you well. I understand you found a perfect place in a perfect state to pursue further career activities. Thank you.    Mr. Fattah. Congratulations.    Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to the administrator.    The chairman is absolutely correct about the inspiration you provide. I know you made a visit to Philadelphia to Overbrook High School which graduated one of your great astronauts, Guion Bluford, and you spoke with the students there and, you know, I am sure even to this day is an inspiration to all there in the Overbrook community.    Now, I was just out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, my second visit. I was there a while back with you when the Mars rover landed after eight and a half months of travel. We were on the control room floor and there was such a celebration because it showed again that the premier entity in the world in terms of space exploration and flight is NASA and to land the rover there.    And I got a chance to see in my last visit two weeks ago or so, you know, some of the work that is still being done on a daily basis at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. And I know that NASA's most valuable control assets are in Texas, but you do have a little operation in Florida and in California.    So I did get a chance to visit with your national headquarters staff here also and I have learned so much about what is going on. And there have been some miscues, I think, in some notion when we retired the shuttle fleet that somehow America was out of the business of leading in space. The truth is that we still lead in space.    And you have some active missions that are going on right now and I would hope that as part of your testimony, you could just share a minute or two about what NASA is doing right now in space because as we deal with the numbers, sometimes we lose a sense of what this is really all about and our exploration of space, our development of space.    And yesterday I got a chance to spend some time with the Commercial Spaceflight Federation for their board meeting and their dinner last night. So I know you had another celebration of very significant import into the work that you have been engaged in.    So we welcome you to the committee. We want to hear about your proposed budget and we want to work with you. And the chairman, there could not be a more committed person, I think, in the Congress to the success of NASA. We have had many conversations and I think you have a true advocate. We are going to work together to create a bipartisan product that can help NASA continue to achieve.    Thank you.    Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    So this is follow-up on what the chairman was talking about in terms of plutonium. And this is at Oak Ridge National Lab, the plutonium, the 238 production, right?    General Bolden. I will take it for the record----    Mr. Fattah. All right. Yeah.    General Bolden . To find out exactly where it is done.    Mr. Fattah. So I think that----    General Bolden. I should know, but I do not.    Mr. Fattah. I have done some work in this space and I think that you are correct that NASA is the only consumer, but it is a commitment on DOE's part to make sure you have what you need.    General Bolden. Yes.    Mr. Fattah. But let me go to the big aspiration here which is flight into deep space, out of lower Earth orbit for humans. And you talked about the great work that is being done now on the launch system and where you are.    There is some sense, and it is only because of your success, that perhaps we can move the timetable and maybe that is not the case, and these are probably people who are not as intimately familiar with the work that you are doing, but if you could comment for a minute on how you see the time line, that would be good.    General Bolden. Congressman, I will do my best. The President has set a rough outline for us in demanding that we provide a way to put humans with an asteroid by 2025, but most importantly that we be on Mars or in the Martian system in the 2030s.    And with that direction in mind and bipartisan agreement by the Congress, we have a long-range program in existence today to which we are marching and that calls for several things.    America is still the leader in space and I am glad to hear Members of the committee acknowledge that because it is important for all of us to understand that. There is no close competitor to be quite honest.    But in order for us to stay the leader in space, there are a number of things we have to do and deep space exploration is one of them, but we have to make sure that we have a very robust low earth orbit infrastructure that will be run by American industry eventually or non-government entities so critical to that is the completion of the commercial crew program that we now have scheduled to actually fly in 2017. We have brought about commercial cargo and that has proven to be successful. I think by the end of this year, you will see how resilient it is when Orbital Sciences flies a Cygnus on a vehicle other than their own vehicle. So when you are buying a service and the service provider provides it, even when a part of their system goes away, that talks about resilience.    Mr. Fattah. I was on the floor of SpaceX out in California looking as they put the Falcon 9 together, and it is amazing that this industry that NASA has spawned is so robust now.    You have Boeing. You have SpaceX, low Earth orbit, the commercial crew. What is in the President's budget is $1.2, I think, 4, right----    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Fattah . $1.24 billion?    General Bolden. One digit farther I can go.    Mr. Fattah. Yeah. And is that sufficient to continue to--I know you have some other pieces of that. You have the advanced exploration system at about 231.4 and then you have the opportunity flight program which is another opportunity to seed this industry and I think 15 plus.    So can you talk about whether that is sufficient to do the work that needs to be done in low Earth orbit so that you can focus on-- and the committee really likes to talk about going to Mars.    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Fattah. Asteroids, you know, is not really, I think, the thing that grabs our attention----    General Bolden. That is okay.    Mr. Fattah . In total.    General Bolden. That is okay.    Mr. Fattah. It hits you. Go ahead.    General Bolden. That is okay.    Mr. Fattah. Go ahead, Mr. Administrator, yeah.    General Bolden. Congressman Fattah, again, I appreciate your reference to the total picture because that is what is really important. And I talked about commercial crew and cargo. $1.2 billion that we requested in the 2016 budget for commercial crew is essential if we are to bring in the two providers with their capability to carry crew to orbit by 2017.    The second leg of the stool is actually the International Space Station and that is an area that I need to ensure that we do not shortchange, that we do not look at it as a bank and begin to pull money out of International Space Station operations because when we use it as a bank, usually the first place we go is cargo flights, fewer cargo flights which eventually could put the crew in jeopardy because we are not able to get stuff there.    The third leg that you refer to is SLS and Orion and once we have a robust lower earth orbit environment, then we use SLS and Orion to take us, first of all, back to cislunar space. That is around the moon over the 10-year period of the 20s. So beginning in the earliest part that we can of the 20s, we will put Orion on the SLS and send it to cislunar space for multiple flights and then on to Mars.    So it is the three-legged stool that is absolutely critical that you are talking about.    Mr. Fattah. The red light is on. The red light is on, but if the chairman would----    Mr. Fattah . Yield. I think you got the Russians' attention in some other respects. They took a decision this week to announce that they were joining a decision that you had already made a year or so ago about extending the life and their presence in cooperation relative to the International Space Station.    Could you just share with the committee where we are with all of our international partners now that Russia has made this decision?    General Bolden. And I would just caution what you hear coming out of Russia is not always what they intended to say. I am encouraged that they now have, in fact, in their reorganization, because they are going through reorganization just as we are, they now have what is called the Roscosmos Science and Technology Council. So that is a brand new entity that was put in place when they put Roscosmos under the umbrella of their whole space industry organization and it is much more complicated than I want to try to explain to people. We were encouraged when Yuri Koptchev who I consider to be, because he is a former colleague of mine, who I consider----    Mr. Fattah. You did a mission with him, right?    General Bolden. No. This is not the astronaut. This was the former head of the Russian Space Agency, of Roscosmos. It was Mr. Koptchev who actually could be considered the Russian father of the International Space Station because he and a predecessor of mine, Dan Goldin, were the two people who were most responsible for getting the station started, if you will. He is the head of the Roscosmos Science and Technology Council (STC) and it was that council that met and said that it was their position that Russia should remain committed to the International Space Station and that they should remain committed through 2024 before they go off and start talking about taking pieces off and establishing their own lower earth orbit infrastructure. So I think that is what you refer to.    I would say one more thing because you commented about international partners. Everyone should take note of the three space walks that were completed this past week. You know, Butch Wilmore and Terry Virts did three absolutely amazing space walks which in themselves were great.    Mr. Fattah. Five hours?    General Bolden. They were long. Each of them was in the neighborhood of six to eight hours. But what was most important was that that completed the installation of the international docking adapter which it gives the International Space Station now the capability of accepting any vehicle from any partner that wants to bring crew to the International Space Station.    So we are now ready to receive. There may be a few puts and takes we have got to do, but the station is now ready to receive Boeing, SpaceX, any American company that wants to fly a vehicle to the International Space Station.    The international part I wanted to point out for everybody, the intra-vehicle crew member, and I have been one, that is the hardest thing on the whole thing. The intra-vehicle crew member, the person inside choreographing all three space walks was Samantha Cristoferetti who is an Italian astronaut.    So if you do not think that our partners are doing their part and that they are excited about this, that was a true international effort to set up American industry to be able to service the International Space Station with crews, and that was incredible.    Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding for those additional few seconds.    Mr. Fattah. Mr. Chairman, I think the Member can be assured that we are interested. This is part of a series of observatories around the world that are critically important to NASA's success.    Mr. Fattah. Also to deal with asteroids that might be coming our way.    Mr. Fattah. If the Chairman would yield for a minute. For instance, because I don't want there to be unnecessary concern, SpaceX has met the first milestone, right?    General Bolden. Oh, SpaceX has met several milestones on the Commercial Crew milestone list.    Mr. Fattah. Okay. And Boeing?    General Bolden. And Boeing, they both have.    Mr. Fattah. Right. So, I mean, there is not that I am aware of any concern that we will not be able to meet this time line as long as we can meet the budget number.    Mr. Fattah. That are on the space station now.    General Bolden. That are on the space station.    Mr. Fattah. Right. So we could evacuate the station if we need to.    General Bolden. I do not anticipate that that day is going to come. I am not worried about getting people to the International Space Station as long as the Congress funds the President's budget at $1.2 billion in 2016, because we will have an American capability to get crews to the International Space Station. Getting them there is not the issue right now, or getting them back is not the issue.    Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will yield for a second.    Mr. Fattah. Right. So first and foremost, just to put this in context and not to belabor it, in terms of the space station for a large period of time, even when we had the shuttle, the Russians took astronauts to the space station, we used the shuttle to take cargo; is that correct as a general matter?    General Bolden. After we lost Columbia in 2003, the conscious decision was made because the Columbia Accident Investigation Board said, get space station completed. We worked with the international partners and decided the most----    Mr. Fattah. What I am saying is that----    General Bolden. But we did carry crews, but we carried the construction crews.    Mr. Fattah. Right.    General Bolden. And we said we would use----    Mr. Fattah. But the main way to get individual astronauts was through the Russians.    General Bolden. Yes.    Mr. Fattah. And when we had the problem with the Russians and Georgia's independence and the military in Chechnya, was there any interruption in our interactions with Russia at that time?    General Bolden. No, sir.    Mr. Fattah. Right. And now we have this new dustup around Ukraine, which is more than a dustup, you know, but it is a similar kind of issue. Has there been any interruption in Russia's cooperation with their part of this partnership?    General Bolden. No, sir.    Mr. Fattah. Right. So now they have also taken a decision this week that they want to extend the life of the International Space Station. They are late to that decision, but they have said something that is useful in that regard. But in the meantime the Administration took some action, right? Because this dismantlement of the shuttle was always going to--putting the shuttle to rest was always going to create this break in our ability, this was known before this Administration came into being. Well, it is being resolved through the ingenuity of American enterprise, because the Administration with the Congress has made a package of decisions about deep space human flight, Commercial Crew and low Earth orbit, and the investment in space technology, so that we can keep our preeminence in space, right? So that is where we are headed.    I wanted to get back to this 238 plutonium. So when we close the Savannah plant--and I am shifting gears now, I went back to where we started at, right?    General Bolden. Yes, sir.    Mr. Fattah. When we closed the Savannah plant in '88, we got out of the plutonium business, we got to somewhere around--when you were in charge we had 35 kilograms of plutonium, the DOE says we are going to get something done at Oak Ridge. I went out to visit the plant at Oak Ridge and they have a $50 million contract with NASA to do this. In the meantime, we also have a problem on the medical side of this with isotopes, which we do not have any domestic capability in this regard either, and the Department of Energy has launched an effort in that regard. But this is very important, because if we are going to power spaceships, we need this plutonium, right? So I just wanted to clear up the record, it is Oak Ridge. And we need to keep mindful of these connections between the subcommittees, because you can speak to your colleague to make sure that that program is robust. Right. But I thank you, we do not have to get into it.    The bottom line is, we are in the lead now. Our lead is not absolute, it is relative. And if we want to stay in the lead, we have got to make these investments or, as some of my colleagues would say, we have to spend--because they get concerned if we use this word investment--spend money, because we cannot lead the world on the cheap. But thank you very much.    General Bolden. Thank you.    Mr. Fattah. And I yield back to the Chairman.    Mr. Fattah. This is the way we are going to work this. I am going to work hand-in-hand with my Chairman and we are going to walk this mile together. And I think at the end of the day, there is one thing I am sure of, NASA is going to be in a better position than it otherwise would be.    Mr. Fattah. And I hope return one to Earth.    General Bolden. So I think that is what you are talking about. And that is really exciting when you think about it. But that, again, is like everything, it comes from science and technology funds, and those are the funds that we continue to cut.    Mr. Fattah. Just a closing comment, not a follow-up question. One is, I want to thank the Chairman, and I think the time clock thing is working. Except for me and you, it has been working great. And I want to thank the Administrator, not for all that you have done in terms of space exploration, but what you are doing in terms of preparing future generations.    The Space Act Agreement with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, four million young people, four thousand clubs all across the country, in getting these young people excited about STEM education in general, but doing that through having them learn about the exciting work of NASA, because that is how we get people who want to be mathematicians and engineers and everything that we need by getting them excited about this.    And I said this to the Chairman in private one day that all of us do not have the benefit of having, you know, Cape Canaverals or NASA Mission Controls in our district, but all of us have these young people who want to live up to their God-given potential, and NASA is the best opportunity to get these young people excited about learning. So I want to thank you for all you have done.    General Bolden. Absolutely.    Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Chairman, I yield back.    Mr. Fattah. That is more of a comment.    Mr. Fattah. Well, no nation except if we claim it, right?                       Chairman's Closing Remarks    Mr. Fattah. I like the way you think, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Fattah. Directly to us. That is----    Mr. Fattah. I will say this publicly, Mr. Chairman, I love the fact that there could be, one, a leadership role, someone on the other team, that says you want to focus on science as the guidepost. So it works for me. All right?    Mr. Fattah. Well first of all let me thank the chairman for hosting this hearing. I think it is very, very important that the premier basic science and research entity in the world, we have an appropriate understanding of your budget and we can do that through this hearing. The work that is being done is critically important. And I want to put in some, and if you would as you talk today, in context what our friends around the world are doing. Right? So I was with Judith Rodin at the Rockefeller Foundation and she was saying that in China they just opened up 100 science only universities, and 200 math and science focused institutions. They have invested a great deal in basic scientific research. Now that is a big and plus populated country. But Singapore, which is a much smaller country, less people there than in the Philadelphia region, their National Science Foundation, which was built off of, you were the benchmark for it, they have invested over $7 billion. And this is a small, small, I mean, you know how big Texas is, right? I mean, 4.5 million people in Singapore. I mean, the fact that they could make such a huge investment.    And then our friends in the European Union with Horizon 2020, which is a seven-year effort, well over $80 billion euros, focused just in six areas. You know, marine science, neuroscience, which of course is my favorite, but agricultural science. So I am wondering when we think about America and we think about our leadership in the world, which was at one point absolute and now is relative. That is, that we still lead but there are people who are chomping at the bit and they want a piece of the action. In fact, Singapore has been hiring away some of our best scientists. So the head of the National Cancer Center, and his spouse, and on, and on, and on. I mean, they have been picking up pieces because they intend to be indispensable in the world. So I am wondering when you talk to us today about the work of the Science Foundation you could put it in context so that it is not just a matter, I do not see it as just a budget for an agency. I really see it as the indispensable lynchpin to this innovation ecosystem in our country. That if we do not invest in basic science research, none of the other things that we want to do as a country are going to be possible, including our national defense which is so very important. A lot of the breakthroughs in our ability to defend ourselves against the world's threats start at their core from work at the, that has been funded by the National Science Foundation.    So welcome, I thank the chairman, and look forward to your testimony.    Mr. Fattah. Thank you. I am in agreement with the chairman on almost everything but when he said that he was concerned about the telescope and he was going to come over to headquarters, he really lost me there. I thought he was saying that we would go to Hawaii and look at the telescope. So, see, so you know, maybe as he follows up, you know, there will be an opportunity for the subcommittee and we can go inspect this.    But no, on a serious note, you know, I want to get to my point in a minute. But obviously we have a department in the federal government that has not been able to be audited. It is the largest recipient of discretionary money, the Department of Defense. It has never been able to sustain an audit. We have a bill I think now where we are saying they have to be audit ready by 2025. But today's budget that will be released will put another $90 billion into Defense. So it is, yes, Mr. Chairman?    Mr. Fattah. Yes, absolutely.    Mr. Fattah. Yes.    Mr. Fattah. So they, in our lifetime we may get to a point where the $600 billion or so we spend in Defense will be auditable in any reasonable way. They lost $9 billion that they cannot account for in Afghanistan. Now in, it is gone. Right. So, I just want to make it clear, right? That these issues are important but everything is relative within the context of the world that we live in. And I appreciate the fact that we have IGs. I, with Chris Shays, was one of the early cosponsors of the bill that created the IG Act. But I think it is very important that they focus, that we need to make the main thing the main thing. Right? So and not get too, that sometimes I think some of their work is not as helpful to focusing on what is the driving impulse here, right? So I want to focus on what I think, and I think everybody in this room knows, that I believe is the main thing which is understanding the human brain. And the chairman is going to, we are going to have a hearing next week. But I see you list this as one of the cross-foundation investments. And I want to make a point.    I was out at a university and saw a young lady who is 51, she has lost complete control of any part of her body. But she was able to move an artificial arm, give me a high five, give me a fist pump, using her thoughts. And this is out of some National Science Foundation research. Thirty years ago there was a scientist, who was the same one I met 30 years later. He got a grant from you because he said he wanted to see what happened in the brains of a chimpanzee when the chimp moved his arm. You know, what neurons fired off? And anyway, this research has been funded, and funded, and funded. And now it has interceded in the lives of people who are suffering from debilitating diseases, where their brains are completely there but their ability to control their body is not. So I want to say that the work of the Foundation is very important. And I want to, the point that I wanted to ask you about is it says in the, this ``Understanding the Human Brain'' that the administration's brain research, that sentence right there. Because the members of this committee, we think that the administration's brain research effort is really, has a paternity that is shared in with the Congress. That we created some language in 2011, I sent a member of the staff of this committee, Darek Newby, over to the National Science Foundation. He met unit by unit with the directorate around what was being done about the human brain. Out of that we passed some bipartisan language that created this brain initiative. And I just want, when the administration comes over, and I love the administration, is to make sure that they are aware that this is a, this is an effort that is joined in with the Congress. This is not something that the administration just decided to go do.    And it is important because this administration, in 20 months or so we will have a new administration. So it is important that you understand and the Foundation understands that the Congress, Chairman Rogers has been very interested in addiction issues. And the chairman and I, we have met numerous times on this issue. That is one of the reasons why we are holding a hearing on this. So I just want to make the point that this is not an executive branch activity solely. This is an activity that the United States Congress and the administration share in, understanding how important this is. So if you would like to respond, please.    Mr. Fattah. I just want the record to be clear. So we have created language in the report that required the creation of the interagency working group.    Mr. Fattah. It was co-chaired by NSF and NIH.    Mr. Fattah. And that the brain initiative is an outgrowth thereof. So that I just think it as important so we can be as supportive as we want to be, that you include an understanding that the Congress shares totally in this effort.    Mr. Fattah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Fattah. Mr. Chairman, if you would yield for just one second, because I think that the Congress--and as President Truman signed the National Science Foundation into existence--the Congress set it up so that it would be a merit-based process with the National Science Board and so on. I do not think that is divorced from political guidance. So, when President Kennedy went to Rice University in 1961 and said, you know, we are going to put a man on the moon, given that is our policy direction from an elected official about direction and where we are going and what we are going to do; that is not trying to be an engineer, though.    So, I think there is a happy mix. There are issues that are important to the country and to the country's, you know, challenges that the Congress needs to set appropriate direction, but I do not think that we should ever get in the middle of discerning, you know, from a merit-based process, you know, what science might be. I mentioned this point earlier about a scientist funded 30 years ago to look at what neurons might fire in the brain of a monkey, that would have been laughed at on the floor of the Congress, but nobody is laughing now because it is helping people to be able to control movement through their thoughts. But this is the same absolute same researcher, research staff and focus from three decades ago, so, you know, we have to find a happy marriage, and I trust my Chairman, as we go forward.    Mr. Fattah. If the Gentlelady would yield for one second?    Mr. Fattah. One of your questions about STEM education, one of the areas is how to get more young women. And as one of the leading scientists in the world, you, obviously, are in a unique position, but the Foundation has set up some additional policies to make it more likely that researchers can stay and do the work they do, notwithstanding some of life's circumstances as they develop.    I was in Israel last week and I met with the head of the Weizmann Institute and they have a very interesting program where because sometimes when they are trying to track women scientist, they have challenges with the family making a decision, and so they just decided, Mr. Chairman, to do it the old-fashioned way, and they increased the offer by fifty percent and they have been very successful. I met some great scientists there.    But if you would talk a little bit about some of the policies that have been implemented and how that has helped the Foundation in this regard, that might be useful.    Mr. Fattah. Well, it is fascinating, Mr. Chairman, it is so fascinating that you asked this question. I am so happy, and I am going to capture that and put that up on my Web site so that school kids in my district can hear your explanation. But it is really this intersection between observational and theoretical astrophysics that really is your hallmark, so I think that for us, it is, you know, we are in the same space, we are in a different game, but it is somewhere between the observation and theoretical that we are going to work through your budget requests, and thank you.    Mr. Fattah. Chairman, if you would just yield if just one last second?    Mr. Fattah. This is just because in the Chairman's state, they have this event, South by Southwest.    Mr. Fattah. Yeah, so we do not have that in Pennsylvania. We have to work on that.    But to make your point, right, you know, there was a company that rolled it just 48 hours ago, a flying car deal, right, that puts together the Google self-driving car technology with aviation's well-known automatic pilot take-off and landing, and they have a concept that would have this car in 800 yards take off and land somewhere, and you do not have to have human interaction; that is, that the car self-drives, and the aviation side is autopilot, and it is the combination of technologies that heretofore, were separated, being united, which makes your point, which is why we have--even though I am interested in neuroscience, we have to invest in science broadly in order to make real achievements, because we really do not know in every instance what is going to come of it.    Mr. Fattah. Well, you started this with the T-shirt deal, so this love-fest has been going.    Mr. Fattah. If the gentlelady would yield for a second?    Mr. Fattah. I think it was a social scientist named Banfield who wrote a paper a long time ago called Metaphysical Madness, right? And it was really the choice between what political people would come up with and what empirical science would, you know. And he figured out that we would probably end up at about the same place, notwithstanding, you know, whichever way you get to it, Mr. Chairman.    But, you know, I think that for administrative witnesses and administration witnesses, it is difficult for them.    Mr. Fattah. Step outside of their role and speak, because they are here representing the Administration.    So I just yield back.    Mr. Fattah. It is a great paper; it is called Metaphysical Madness. The scientist's name is Banfield.    Mr. Fattah. I will submit some questions for the record, but thank you very much.    Mr. Fattah. Mr. Chairman, this idea is growing on me. It is growing on me.    Mr. Fattah. Thank you.    Mr. Fattah. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Let me just note that in this discussion about the operations of the Congress and bipartisanship, that this entire effort has been bipartisan from the beginning. And this hearing is further evidence of it because the chairman has, in a very tight window, you know, allowed us to go forward from where we were last year where we had our first ever hearing in the appropriations process on neuroscience.    We are to continue that this year, and I want to thank you, but it is not surprising because the chairman and I worked together on another subcommittee where we did some very, very important work on brain health in terms of veterans. When he previously chaired the Veterans and Military Construction Subcommittee, you know, we worked together and made major investments through the VA and Epilepsy Centers for Excellence and post-traumatic stress and suicide prevention, and on and on and on. And the VA, obviously, was one of the entities that--the departments that worked with the Interagency Working Group.    So I want to welcome our witnesses. We have done a lot in this committee since 2011 when we created the Interagency Working Group, and we are now working aggressively. We have doubled the amount of dollars through the National Science Foundation focused on this after the creation of what is called a budget theme, and the understanding of the brain, we are going to hear more about that day.    And last year's appropriations bill moved to include an important element of the Nation's scientific enterprise, our National Labs, working with the National Science Foundation on the development of a national brain observatory. So I am excited. We are going to hear about where we are with the BRAIN Initiative in terms of mapping of the brain. We are going to hear a lot from your testimony today.    And, again, I thank the chairman because he has through--I mean he has got a lot of interests in terms of space exploration, but it has no way had him step back from a commitment to make sure that we keep our eyes focused on the greatest scientific mystery that we know of, which is how our brains, which controls everything else, actually functions, and so I thank the chairman and look forward to your testimony.    Mr. Fattah. Zombie immune system.    Mr. Fattah. I am a public figure. You can use it.    Mr. Fattah. Mr. Chairman, no. Thank you for your interest in these and all matters of science. So you can see my chairman is engaged. So it is very important.    I want to make sure we go back because, in order to respond to the chairman, you kind of ad-libbed your remarks, and I want to make sure that we put on the record--this is a very important part of our process, hearings and public record--the scientific challenge in front of us.    So the human brain, as best as we understand, about 100 billion neurons, 100 trillion connections. It runs on low electricity and it does a lot, and we don't understand much of it. Is that right, Dr. Olds?    Mr. Fattah. I went out to Stanford and met with one of your colleagues, Dr. Newsome. He says, you know, if we are talking about looking at a map, we don't see the highways, the roads. We don't really have a good understanding and, even if we did, we don't understand the traffic that is on there. Right?    So Paul Allen came into Philly. He announced a major investment into a cell institute. Now, he has already put a half a billion dollars into a brain institute. The cell institute is to look at the 50-plus trillion cells in the human body.    But one of the things--the reason I was there--it was in Philly, but the reason I was there was that, in the cells in the brain, we don't yet know all of the cells in the brain and the cell types. Is that accurate?    Mr. Fattah. Right.    Mr. Fattah. But we are not there yet.    Mr. Fattah. Right. Because I want the chairman just to work with me here so we have got a system in which there is a lot of interactions with the neural network that we don't understand, and we don't understand even the basics, the, you know, kind of identification of all the cells.    So, the effort here is one of, you know, from just a task, it is a gigantic task. Right? So one of the things that the committee did in last year's bill was we did move to internationalize and to create collaborations and we have tasked the National Science Foundation with having--with developing an international conference because there is these efforts.    And the committee has supported my work, whether it is Israel or the EU and others, to try to kind of cobble together. The EU has now put a billion and a half euros on the table for the Human Brain Project, Henry Markram. There are a lot of interests in trying to work together because there are, based on the World Health Organization's number, over a billion human beings with a neurological disease or disorder. Right?    And the contention is that, at least as I approach this, is that we need a basic understanding of how a healthy brain would function as at least part and parcel to trying to figure out what to do about some of the challenges.    So as the National Science Foundation is understanding the brain, we saw the EAGER grants, which were great, and we see your request this year.    The basic next steps, as you see it, where we need to go, if you could talk to the chairman and I about that in terms of the cost side. Right?    So, you know, we know on the health side we spent a lot of money. We spent $210 billion last year on care for Alzheimer's. Right? So I know we spent a lot of money.    We spent $500 billion on mobility challenged Americans. So these are people who have suffered from stroke or some traumatic brain injury. And so we are spending a lot on the care side. We are spending a paltry amount of money in trying to figure out any of this.    And the way I would phrase it, Mr. Chairman, is the Allen Institute, which just spent a half a billion dollars, they have now completed an essential framework for how the mouse's brain works. Right? And it is about a million neurons?    Mr. Fattah. Ten million. Right.    So they got this thing, so that is about where we are. Ten million versus this 100 billion. And that is a mouse. And the translation from animal to human is about 1 percent in neuroscience, different from, in all other areas it is about 50 percent. So if you can find a cure in an animal, 50 percent of the time it will work in a human being.    When you talk about the brain, it is 1 percent translation. So even when you find something that makes a mouse, you know, operate a little bit better, restore memory, whatever, you can't bet the ranch that you are going to be able to translate it to a human being. Is that correct?    Mr. Fattah. All right. So talk to the chairman about where we need to be going over the next, me and him are going to be here for the next 10 years doing this, and we want to see at the end of this or sooner major relief for these families who have these challenges. Right?    We also are interested in the science and the sexiness of this, but at the heart of this is human beings, a billion of them worldwide, 100 million in our own country. And so talk to us about how you see us not just this year, but over the next period of time here what we need to try to get done.    Mr. Fattah. To make disruptive progress.    Mr. Fattah. Can you yield for a second?    Mr. Fattah. Mr. Chairman?    Mr. Fattah. I was just at the Weizmann Institute in Tel Aviv, well, in Israel, right outside of Tel Aviv, and they just created this, they have been working on this bionic nose with some funding from the National Science Foundation.    These 6 million neurons that are right up here, they are below the blood-brain barrier. So they are very interested, neuroscientists are very interested in them because they can reach them.    But this nose is at University of Penn, they developed some ability of getting dogs to sniff out cancer. So they have been able to get this bionic nose to sniff cancer and, also, explosives and illegal narcotics. And it is fascinating.    But go right ahead.    Mr. Fattah. Well, Mr. President, it is good to see you again.    As President of the Society for Neuroscience, you have, the chairman mentioned earlier about this misfolding protein issue. And there is a member of your group, Dr. Soto, who is at the University of Texas at Houston, who has spent some considerable amount of time looking and he has really been working, he thinks that this, that the idea of this misfolding protein is, you know, the key to a number of these different disorders.    I am trying to get, and I didn't get it directly from what Dr. Olds said. We are going to try to start with one place and move to the next place. I am trying to get a sense of where, if we were going to make a major leap forward, you sense that we need to be investing resources and efforts.    Mr. Fattah. Last question for, okay.    Mr. Lynch, the Potomac Institute released a study on neurotechnology 3 years ago, and they said that, from an economic standpoint, the economics of this in terms of GDP would be more impactful than any of the other economic revolutions in our country if we were able to figure out some of these problems, solve them, and build the industries that would benefit from them.    So you are involved on the industry development side of this. In terms of venture capital, in terms of the work, one of the things that I have seen internationally is there is a lot of action in this space--right?--people trying to figure out diagnostic tools, people trying to figure out, you know, treatments.    And where do you see America relative to the development of the neurotechnology industry?    Mr. Fattah. That is what Potomac was saying, that, if America misses the boat here, you know, it is kind of lights out, that this is like the area in which, the next wealth-building phase in the world is going to operate in.    Mr. Fattah. One of the other jurisdictions we have is the Commerce Department. So I have spoken with the Commerce Secretary when she was here about Commerce developing a neurotechnology focus so that we could make sure that American industry is focused on this trade space and ways that we need to, and she has agreed to do that.    So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back to you.    Mr. Fattah. Mr. Chairman, you were asking about breakthroughs earlier. Let me interrupt your train of thought and tell you I was.    Mr. Fattah. Something that you will be excited about.    So Keith Black, who is the head of neurosurgery at Cedars-Sinai, was doing some research that showed that you can use a part of the venom from a scorpion that will only attach to non-healthy cells in the brain, and it allows the surgeon to now just go in and pluck out the tumor that otherwise is hard to discern.    So this is where nature, you were talking about God's sense of humor, whereas nature--there is a lot going on out there, but this was a fascinating piece. I knew you would be.    Mr. Fattah. So I wanted to share that with you. I am going to send you the paper. They are doing the clinic trials now. So it is working out quite well.    Mr. Fattah. So they can, you know, and Senator Kennedy, we know lots of people who had these brain tumors not to a good result.    But this particular technique enables the surgeon by utilizing something called chlorotoxin 35, which is part of the venom from an actual scorpion spider. It kind of lights up the runway, you know, for the snippers to come, you know.    Mr. Fattah. It is kind of like not to minimize, but it is just like everything else. I mean, it is like the automobile. You know, if used for its purpose, fine.    And that is why I think OSTP at the origins of this effort with the Interagency Working Group put together a ethics group. I know the president, Amy Gutmann, was involved and some others.    So, you know, it is a big concern. However, as Newt Gingrich said, it is the larger challenge for the country. If we can't delay Alzheimer's by 5 or 6 years, you know, we are going to go bankrupt.    Mr. Fattah. We have got to figure out our way forward and we have got to make sure that people don't misuse the technology.    Mr. Fattah. But to get closer to your line, there are issues here that are useful for us from an intelligence standpoint and other things for national security that are also beneficial and is closer to the line you are concerned about, but have some utility.    Mr. Fattah. Let me jump on the more positive side of this for a minute.    So, you know, I was out in the Napa Valley, the Staglins. They had a son who had some challenges with schizophrenia. And since that time, he is doing great, but they engaged themselves in this effort and raised a lot of money, over $250 million of private money, particularly for schizophrenia-related research. And they fund early investigators.    And part of what seems to be emerging as part of some of their research is that some of this gaming activity can be therapeutically useful and that part of the challenge--it is not the totality of the challenge--but part of the challenges of some of these young people. It is almost always young people who face these schizophrenic circumstances and almost always boys, not in every circumstance, but more so than not just getting the brain functioning slightly more efficiently by activity actually provides some benefit.    And then I was out in Tom Cole's backyard at the University of Oklahoma's, got a program called a center called K20, and they were developing these games that my teenager likes, these sim games, but imbedding in the game, you know, things that we would want, you know, interest in STEM education and going to college and, you know, hiding these notions in nuanced sort of ways inside the game so that even the kids are playing them they are getting indoctrinated with positive messages.    So I think, you know, some of this we are going to have to run with and just try to improve as we go, Mr. Chairman.    But I do want to, as we go to wrap up, I want to thank the chairman again because it is not the norm in a majority-minority situation that there would be a hearing like this, and I want to thank you.    But it just shows that the interest in this matter is not partisan and we intend, you know, well beyond this administration, which has got, you know, 20 more months and has done some important work--but this is work that we are going to be engaged in for a long time going forward that we need to deal with.    And we need to do it on all of the fronts. We didn't talk a lot about traumatic brain injury today, but we have close to 3 million Americans--and I am not talking about servicemembers now--3 million--a lot of them young people--not all of them--but, you know, riding their bikes, playing games, who end up with very serious injuries.    And the things that we thought we knew about traumatic brain injuries in the past we now know differently, and there is a lot more that can be done. And this is an area where we want to do, that we need to, also look at because it is very different from the disease side.    These are actually, we had our own colleague who was shot in the head, Congresswoman Giffords, and, you know, in past circumstances, you wouldn't see the kind of recovery that has happened. But, you know, it is because of the great work that is being done. But we need to work in this space more.    And I know that the chairman and I did work on this on the veterans' side, but this is on the civilian side, it is a very important issue, too.    So I want to thank the chairman and I want to thank our guests.    Mr. Fattah. It is a team effort, and we are going to keep going. All right.    Mr. Fattah. Together. Right.    Mr. Fattah. And let me thank OSTP for shepherding this, and you have done a great job, Dr. Rubin and Dr. Hogan and the team there, because this is a massive enterprise stretching across both the government and the private sector and private foundations and academia and hospitals. I mean, there are just a lot of people, including people focused on ethics, who have to be part of this. So thank you and----    Mr. Fattah. Somehow I think we might be having another hearing on neuroscience next year this time in the appropriations process.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
