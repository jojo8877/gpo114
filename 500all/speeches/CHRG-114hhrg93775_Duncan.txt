The time of the gentleman----    Mr. Duncan . Is long expired.    Mr. Carson?    Mr. Duncan. Well, thank you, Mr. Carson.    Mayor Becker, I have to tell you that from the time I was 9 until I was 17, I grew up at City Hall. My dad for a little over 3 years was city law director and then mayor for about 6 years. And I learned that everybody and his brother wanted to be a fireman or a policeman, and then the day after they went on the force, they wanted a promotion and a raise. And I wonder, is that still true?    Mr. Duncan. Let me ask two quick questions. Number one, I chaired a special panel last year on public-private partnerships, and on all types of transportation and infrastructure projects, a lot of places seem to be going more toward public-private partnerships. We found out there is great interest in that. We had a hearing on Wall Street, and some of the financial giants came to us and said that they were getting a lot of calls.    Do you see that as a wave of the future, or are you skeptical about public-private partnerships in regard to transportation and infrastructure projects?    Mr. Duncan. Well, thank you very much. We have found that there are some efficiencies on a lot of these projects that are possible if they are done right.    Director Cox, I am a strong supporter of building roads and fixing roads up, and I really like roadbuilders. But in some States, roadbuilding has been a very highly profitable industry. Do you think, number one, is there enough competition in the roadbuilding industry in most States? And secondly, are you doing anything to try to hold down the costs of these roadbuilding projects so we can get the work done but save a little money, too?    Mr. Duncan. All right. Thank you very much.    Mrs. Napolitano?    Mr. Duncan. Thank you.    We will turn the time over to Mr. Woodall.    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time expired. Thank you.    We will turn the time over to Congresswoman Edwards.    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady's time is expired.    We turn the time over to Mr. Babin.
