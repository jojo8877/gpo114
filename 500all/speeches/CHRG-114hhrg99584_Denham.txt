    Mr. Denham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Shea, first of all, let me thank you for the work that you have done on avian influenza in California. California continues to face a number of different threats, but I know there has been some great work done on avian influenza.    One of our other challenges: I have a lot of citrus and stone fruit crops in our area. We have had issues with citrus greening and plum pox virus. Those have been addressed in our area. Our concern is that Canada does not have the same eradication policies that we do. My question to you would be, are you working with our Canadian counterparts, and do you see future efforts there to address it before it comes to our area?    Mr. Denham. Yes, please.    Mr. Denham. Thank you. We have been having a number of discussions with the Ambassador on TPP. My concern and questions have been largely around the sanitary and phytosanitary standards. As you know, I am sure you are aware, at times our crops get held up in foreign ports over different issues. I would ask if you have seen the phytosanitary/sanitary piece of the TPP?    Mr. Denham. Thank you.    And, Mr. Harriger, I mean citrus greening, the plum pox virus, the glassy-winged sharpshooter, have been a big issue in the past. What are the joint issues that are being resolved between agencies to tighten up these illegal movements that could bring these different pests in?    Mr. Denham. Thank you.
