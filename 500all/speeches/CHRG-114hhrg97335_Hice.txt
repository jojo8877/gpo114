    Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Dr. Fischer, let me begin with you. Just from a general guess or estimation, how often are Federal agencies attacked by nation states?    Mr. Hice. Well, of course they are, but you wouldn't have any guess? Just generally speaking, I am curious what percentage are we looking at.    Mr. Hice. Okay, if you would, please get back with me on that. Would you have any idea which nation states have been most active in attacking Federal agencies?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Would those same nation states be responsible for attacking companies as well as Federal agencies?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Would you try to get some more information back to us on that?    Mr. Hice. Mr. Wilshusen, what recommendations has GAO made to various agencies as it relates to management, oversight of contractors in regard to cybersecurity?    Mr. Hice. Have they been responsive to those recommendations?    Mr. Hice. You do follow up?    Mr. Hice. Okay.    Ms. Seymour, OPM was one of the agencies reviewed by GAO. What steps has OPM taken to improve?    Mr. Hice. All right, so it is evolving. But is there accountability? You are staying on top of that issue?    Mr. Hice. Okay, thank you.    Mr. Scott, let me come to you. The report by GAO last year reported the need for these controls on contractors and oversight thereof, and it was mentioned a while ago you were answering the six Federal agencies were evaluated, five of the six came back being inconsistent in all of this. As a result, there evidently is some confusion, as was brought up. What is being done to resolve the confusion?    Mr. Hice. When can we expect a timetable for implementing all of this?    Mr. Hice. Okay. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
