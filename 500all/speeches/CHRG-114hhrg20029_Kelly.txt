    Mr. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. O'Malia, in your testimony you say that we need to understand the cumulative effect of these regulatory changes on the economy before they are fully implemented, and I agree with you. However, I am assuming the proponents of the changes would argue that the potential adverse effects of the economy could be much greater if we don't expeditiously implement the changes. How do you respond to such claims?    Mr. Kelly. And kind of going back on your line, and following up with what Chairman Conaway talked about, it is easy to say when things don't generate income or revenue, that those costs are passed on to the banks. However, I spent quite a bit of my time in the districts speaking with banks and constituents, and my experiences have been that most of the time, whether it is a ham sandwich or a Mercedes Benz, that that cost is generally always passed on to the consumer, because the margins keep getting thinner in this world and generally that is passed on to the consumers, which basically blocks people out from being able to get income that they need. Do you agree?    Mr. Kelly. Thank you. Mr. Lukken, why did the G20 call for the imposition of margin and higher capital requirements, and how does the posting of margin and holding additional capital reduce systemic risk?    Mr. Kelly. And I had another question, but I am going to run out of time. I thank all you witnesses for being here and taking the time to explain this extremely complex math to most of us regular folks.    And, Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back.    The Chairman. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas, former chair of the full Committee.
