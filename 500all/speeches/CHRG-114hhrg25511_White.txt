    Mr. White. Our bank is a blue collar as opposed to a blue blood bank. We operate in a number of parishes from Baton Rouge down to St. Bernard, and we provide free checking. So it doesn't get better than that. We advertise it, promote it, we also provide debit cards and payment cards that you can use. But the essential service that we provide is free checking.
