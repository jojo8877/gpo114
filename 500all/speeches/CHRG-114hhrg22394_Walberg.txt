    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that and enjoyed my time in your district over Thanksgiving. I'm notifying you of that now since you don't have a chance to call the sheriff.    Back to serious. Like many areas across the country, the communities in my district, Mahnomen County right on the Toledo line and others, have experienced some significant struggles in fighting against the growing tide of heroin use and abuse and also the misuse of medication, prescription pain medicines as well.    I'm aware that ONDCP has increased some of their efforts in this area, specifically through the Heroin Response Strategy. Unfortunately, this program is limited to certain regional areas.    Mr. Botticelli, what efforts has ONDCP undertaken to address prescription drug abuse and heroin use?    Mr. Walberg. Is that simply where they're going because of reduced cost to them, accessibility, and other reasons?    Mr. Walberg. Okay. Thank you.    So, Mr. Kelley, what efforts has the HIDTA program undertaken to address prescription drug abuse and heroin use, following up with what Director Botticelli said?    Mr. Walberg. International as well?    Mr. Walberg. Thank you.    And my time has expired, and thanks for the latitude.
