    Mr. Kline. Yes, that won't work. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a good hearing. Thanks for yielding to me to ask a question. I really want to thank the witnesses. You are an excellent panel. Years of expertise.    When we look at data and data privacy in the large, we as Americans ought to be concerned. We have seen spectacular reaches, big retail firms where all of their customers' information was made available to whoever was doing the hacking. Because these cyber attacks are not just a matter of rhetoric, they are a matter of fact. And so whenever you have data that is compiled, today, we have to be somewhat concerned that data will be made available. So as we look at this, we need to keep that in mind.    And I am also concerned that when we are dealing with technology--we, the Congress--we, the government. But we, the Congress, particularly--there is a great danger that we will be trundling along here years behind. In the House we move slowly. In the Senate they hardly move at all. And so it is a little troubling that we could be developing policy that by the time it is enacted is already outdated.    So I could probably start anywhere, but I am going to go to Ms. Knox to--I would like for you to get at the issue of the amount of technology that there is in the classrooms. It is not a simple question of the paper file drawer now being on a flash drive somewhere. There is all kinds of stuff. We have got hardware, software, apps, tablets, kids with cell--we have all kinds of things going on there.    So can you help us understand some common principles or ideas that we should be looking at when we are trying to update FERPA that will not get in the way of supporting technology in the classroom, but which can provide some privacy and something that won't be outdated tomorrow or in a week or something like that? Just give it your best shot.    Mr. Kline. Thank you. I see my time is expired, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
