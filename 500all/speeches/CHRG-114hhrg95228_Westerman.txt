    Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I do appreciate you all coming and testifying today. This is the kind of stuff engineers like to listen to.    So my first question is to Secretary Winfree regarding research and development technology. How does the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology identify duplicative research programs at the Department of Transportation, and if redundancies are identified, how are they addressed?    Mr. Westerman. All right. Next question, for Dr. Smith and Dr. Meyer, you know, with the issues with funding for transportation, when conducting research for transportation systems, how much emphasis is placed on life cycle cost, initial construction cost, and overall economic impact of designs as it relates to earthwork, and base preparation, and pavement systems, and, you know, things like bridge and overpass structures?    Mr. Westerman. So can you give some examples of recent developments in highway transportation that have resulted from federally funded research that have increased transportation durability and----    Mr. Westerman. --reduced life cycle cost?    Mr. Westerman. So is the real apple out there still in materials? You mentioned nanotechnology. What can we expect in the future? Because, you know, you think about how long highway systems have been analyzed in research.    Mr. Westerman. What's left to gain?    Mr. Westerman. I'm out of time, Madam Chair.    Chairwoman Comstock. I now recognize Mr. Palmer.
