    Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, panel, for your invigorating testimony.    Dr. Dzau, what's your anticipated timeline for the initiative on human gene editing?    Mr. Westerman. So how great are your concerns that the initiatives may not be able to keep up with the breakneck speed of the technology as it moves forward?    Mr. Westerman. So you said the scientific community is driving the research. As the National Academies' work on the new initiatives for building the framework, do you believe the scientific community will embrace and voluntarily follow the guidelines or will there need to be regulations or laws put in place?    Mr. Westerman. All right. And the advisory group to the initiative that was named yesterday, it includes scientists and researchers from China and the United Kingdom. Do you believe these participants will help influence Asia and Europe to adopt similar standards?    Mr. Westerman. So what capacity and infrastructure does the Chinese Government have in place for regulating human scientific research?    Mr. Westerman. Thank you, and I believe I'm out of time, Madam Chair.    Chairwoman Comstock. All right. Thank you.    And I now recognize Mr. Foster.
