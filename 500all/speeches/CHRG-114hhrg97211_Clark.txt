    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you to all the panelists who are with us today for this really interesting and important discussion.    I had a question maybe for you, Mr. Johnson. You were talking about students coming back who maybe had the BA and you're quickly allowing them to get that associate's degree. How do you find the balance between helping business fill that short-term talent pipeline and the longer best educational goals for our students, maybe sort of the reverse of what you were describing? How do we find that balance?    Ms. Clark. Great. And to pick up on a discussion we were having with my colleague from California, how do you think the assessment tests and sort of this remedial course work--I hear from students in my district that it's a big barrier. Students, as you were talking about, are trying, especially in our community college system, to either balance work or get to that first job as quickly as possible while they continue their education.    How can we do a better job of aligning with the K through 12 system? And do you have any models that you think are really working?    Ms. Clark. Great. Thank you.    And, Dr. Ricks, you have had tremendous experience on bringing women and people of color into the STEM field. Can you talk a little bit about that experience in Washington, D.C., and what lessons you think that we can incorporated for the Perkins program?
