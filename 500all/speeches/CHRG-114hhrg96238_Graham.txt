    Ms. Graham. Thank you so much. Thank you again for being here today.    We talked a lot about what has gone into developing the proposed next generation of LRS . Are we also looking at the adaptability for the future so that whoever is seated here 10 years from now isn't talking about an already obsolete LRS that we are again having to invest in building new aircraft? Something I think we all should be focusing on is we know what we are capable of today, but are we looking into the future in order of adaptability so we are not pouring additional--huge amounts of resources into future aircraft sooner than we need to? Thank you so much.    Ms. Graham. All three terrific answers. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I don't have any more time, but thank you for being here. Again, I appreciate it.
