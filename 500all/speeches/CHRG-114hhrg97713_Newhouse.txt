    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Secretary and Mr. Administrator, for being here with us this morning. I just have one question in this area to ask you about. And following up a little bit on Mrs. Hartzler's line of questioning. Being from the State of Washington, we have a significant, I guess you could say, access to the Pacific Rim, but also that means access to areas of potential conflict, also areas of regular food need. So just some questions about how flagships are selected. Does geographical distribution play into that equation? And how much does proximity to potential conflict areas play into that? And how much deals with where food aid is being sent and distributed?    Mr. Newhouse. Yes.    Mr. Berteau.--in our war plan and our war games to exercise that.    Mr. Newhouse. Okay. Yes. Well, there again, thank you very much for your contribution this morning. It is a very interesting subject, and I appreciate the joint committee hearing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
