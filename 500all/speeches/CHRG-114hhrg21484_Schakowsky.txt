    Ms. Schakowsky. This is exactly the conversation that I have been wanting to get into.    Dr. Woodcock, in conclusion you say ``It is virtually undisputed that we are facing a public health crisis because of the rise of serious resistant infections and the simultaneous decline in R&D in this area.'' What I am hearing is that there is not enough profit in addressing this problem. And that sets my hair on fire. If this is a worldwide public health issue and the reason that we cannot make progress is because--as have been called--our industry partners are unwilling to do that because there is not enough money, then it seems to me exactly the space then that government needs to step in and deal with this.    I just don't understand the word ``incentives''--and there may be other ways besides money. I don't know. But what are we talking about here, that these companies are getting out of the business, that the Pfizers are getting out of the business. There is just not enough dough here when at some point this could be just a worldwide problem of the bug that is going to kill, I don't know, millions of people. Somebody answer me.    Ms. Schakowsky. Right.    Ms. Schakowsky. Well, can I----    Ms. Schakowsky . Interrupt for a second? I think one of the other issues that contributes to that problem is TV advertising of drugs, which has created an atmosphere among consumers that I am in charge of my health, I am going to go to my doctor, I am going to say what I want, I will find a way to get that drug. I just wanted to add that. I think that is part of the culture that contributes to this problem. Anybody?    Ms. Schakowsky. Well, I hope that bottom line isn't that we have to look at the bottom line of for-profit companies to figure out whether we are going to protect the health of this planet.
