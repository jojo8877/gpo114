    Ms. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Welcome, Madam Secretary.    Ms. Wilson. Unfortunately, Florida, my State, is one of 19 States that has failed to expand Medicaid under the ACA. Can you speak to why Medicaid expansion is so important for communities of color, especially in my home State, and across the country?    Ms. Wilson. Our governor has repeatedly rejected expansion, citing budget restraints. Can you speak to how Florida and other States may actually see budgetary relief under Medicaid expansion?    Ms. Wilson. How are we assured that our communities of color are getting the information they need to successfully enroll?    Ms. Wilson. Just keep up the good work. I yield back.
