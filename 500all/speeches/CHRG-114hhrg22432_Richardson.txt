    Admiral Richardson. Good morning, sir. Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, distinguished members of the committee, I am honored and humbled for the privilege to appear before you today as your CNO on behalf of the over 500,000 active and reserve sailors, our civilians, and their families.    Admiral Richardson. Is that better? To start, sir, I want to thank you and the committee for your leadership in keeping our Nation secure, and in keeping our Navy the strongest that has ever sailed the seas. This year's budget continues our important work. I always think it is good to start by framing the problem. America is a maritime Nation, and our prosperity is inextricably linked to our ability to operate freely in the maritime environment. And today's strategic environment is increasingly globalized and increasingly competitive. Our global systems are used more and more, they are stressed more, and they are contested more. For the first time in 25 years, there is competition for control of the seas. The maritime environment has seen explosive growth; from the sea floor to space, from deep water to the shoreline, and in the information domain, things are accelerating.    The global information system has become pervasive and has changed the way we do business, we all do business, including at sea. And technology is being introduced at an unprecedented rate, and is being adopted by society just as fast.    And finally, Mr. Chairman, as you outlined, a new set of competitors are moving quickly to use these forces to their advantage, and for the first time in 25 years, the U.S. is facing a return to great power competition. These new forces have changed what it means for the Navy and Marine Corps to provide maritime security. And while the problems are more numerous and complex, our responsibility remains the same. Naval forces must provide our leaders credible options to protect America from attack, advance our prosperity, further our strategic interests, assure our allies and partners, and deter our adversaries, which rests on our ability, and, with our sister services, to win decisively if conflict breaks out.    To do this, the Navy is focusing on four lines of effort. First and foremost, we are going to do right by our people. Everything we do begins and ends with them. With the Marines, we are going to broaden our Naval warfighting concepts and capabilities. We are going to strengthen our partnerships, and we are going to learn faster. Unquestionably, the most important part of our Navy is our Navy team. Everything we do begins with them. As our platforms and missions become more complex, the need for talented people continues to be a challenge. We need to recruit, train, and retain the right people and our Sailor 2025 initiatives that the Secretary highlighted are aimed squarely at that challenge. These efforts are based on our core values of honor, courage, and commitment, and demonstrated through four core attributes: integrity, accountability, initiative, and toughness.    That team is committed to our mission, which requires us to strengthen our power at and from the sea. This budget reflects some very tough choices as we achieve this aim. We prioritize shipbuilding and the industrial base to the maximum extent possible.    First in that effort is the Ohio Replacement Program, which I believe is vital to our survival as a Nation. We are taking steps to more deeply ingrain information warfare. We are investing in our Naval aviation enterprise, rapidly integrating unmanned systems, and bolstering our investments in advanced weapons. In addition to these investments, we are also adjusting our behaviors to keep pace with the world that continues to accelerate. We are doubling down on our approach that relies more heavily on experimentation and prototyping, and we are pursuing multiple avenues to drive shorter learning cycles into all that we do. We must learn faster.    Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee, the 2017 Navy budget is this year's best approach to solving the problems and seizing the opportunities that face the Navy today. I thank you, and I look forward to your questions.    Admiral Richardson. If I could----    Admiral Richardson. Sir, I think also, just in support of the Secretary's comments, some of the strategies to do sort of block-buy approaches, where you are buying many ships, you know, at once. Not only is that the most efficient way to get ships for the best price, but it also instills a sense of confidence in the industrial base that there will be a consistent, predictable investment. It allows them to invest, and so we appreciate the work of the committee to, you know, provide that type of flexibility so that we can go in, provide long-term confidence that will grow, you know, or strengthen that industrial base even down to some of those sub-tier providers that are, you know, in many senses, as the Secretary said, really, literally hanging on by a thread.    Admiral Richardson. Sir, as the Secretary said, the validated requirement remains for 52 small-surface combatants. The LCS is the current program that fulfills that commitment, and those ships play a vital role as independent actors. As you know, the LCS has deployed already and has done terrific work on those deployments, and has a vital role in our meeting, you know, warfighting scenarios as well.    You know, they are not, they never were designed to be, you know, the one and only ship. They operate alone for some missions and in concert with the rest of the battle fleet for others. But they provide our central capabilities, not only as a surface combatant, and we are enhancing our capability there by virtue of the small-surface combatant task force which resulted in the modifications, improvements, and lethality, and survivability that will be incorporated into the ultimate frigate design. We will back-fit those capabilities as much as possible into all of the LCSs.    They provide an antisubmarine warfare capacity, both with their helicopter, their towed arrays, and then they also provide a role in the mine countermeasures mission. So, a very flexible ship. And as the Secretary said, the Force Structure Assessment, that process by which we determine the size of the fleet remains valid at 52. The fact that we are truncating at 40, I think, reflects, you know, the hard choice, the extremely hard choices that we had to make to deliver this budget.    Admiral Richardson. Ma'am, I couldn't agree with you more that the Arctic is becoming an increasingly strategic area, particularly as the Arctic ice cap recedes, those waterways are opening up for twice as long as they were before. That is exposing continental shelves and the resources on them to that. We remain committed to staying on that roadmap to enhance our ability to operate in the Arctic. With respect to icebreakers, we are working very closely with our partners in the Coast Guard. That part of the mission will remain theirs. The security part will remain ours. And we have had a steady presence. In March, the Secretary and I will go up and participate in what has been an ongoing exercise program in the Arctic where we send our submarines up there to surface through the ice, continue to do research, and ensure that we can operate up there. We are right now, General----    Admiral Richardson. The Coast Guard runs our icebreakers. Yes, ma'am.    Admiral Richardson. I think the Commandant of the Coast Guard has been very articulate in saying he is not satisfied that that is enough.    Admiral Richardson. We are right there with our Coast Guard partners saying that we need to enhance, increase our number of icebreakers.    Admiral Richardson. Thank you, ma'am.    Admiral Richardson. Ma'am, thanks for that question. And readiness for me is one of the things which both General Neller and I are most concerned, and it has, even within the Navy, it has many dimensions, if you will. One aspect of readiness is the ability to repair our ships on time, and so our ability to get our ships through the public and private shipyards on time and on schedule is key to getting them back out to sea where they belong at that level of readiness.    Similarly, our ability to, you know, train our people to make sure that they come through the deployment cycle and get a chance to go into the schools and get the training that they need, then come together as a team, join their units and work up together and deploy together is another very important part of our readiness. This is particularly true with our pilots, for instance, which are dependent upon, you know, flying hours, getting in that aircraft and doing the time they need at the high end to make sure that they deploy fully ready.    And so, there is a further readiness dimension that involves munitions. Do we send our forces forward with the right weapons, and this is an area where we have, frankly, been taking risk in terms of, you know, the numbers of munitions that we need to fully execute the scenarios that we are called to do. And then there is, you know, the supply parts and everything else. Just the basic logistics.    And so in all of those areas, you know, if you add all of that up together, our requirement is to have two carrier strike groups ready at any time, and three ready to go within 30 days. That is our reinforcement force that will go out and supplement those initial two that respond immediately.    The ability to do that has been challenged. It really started back in 2007, when we started those long deployments, you know, 10 months became almost the norm in terms of deployment. It was further exacerbated by sequestration in 2013, which put just a tremendous divot in the system with the hiring freezes, the overtime caps, et cetera, our ability to get through all of those. We are still recovering from that. And those are, you know, investments that we have to invest in to make up for lost time. Right now, we are right at sustainment, and so our ability to recover that readiness keeps moving out to the right. It was 2020. This year it is, you know, beyond 2020, because we are just having a hard time closing that readiness gap. And I will defer to General Neller to talk about the Marine Corps.    Admiral Richardson. Sir, I just, I will reinforce what the Secretary said that, you know, in the context of the rebalance to the Pacific, the Indo-Pacific, really, you know, this South China Sea challenge should be appreciated in that. And not only are we sending 60 percent of a bigger fleet--and we are on track to do that, we are on our program--but also, you know, our higher-end capability is going out there as well. So it is not just numbers. And it gets back to what the Secretary said. It is, you know, it is about options and it is about credible options. You have got to have something there to have an option, and that thing has to be capable enough to be credible.    To the question of resources, you know, I work very closely with Admiral Harris and Admiral Swift, our commanders out there in the Pacific to make sure that if they see any kind of a challenge with respect to resources that would hinder or impede the number of options they have, that we address that right away. We are not seeing that right now, sir.    Admiral Richardson. Absolutely. The sequestration, the specter of sequestration would set us back irreparably across the Navy, whether it be readiness, force levels, capability, that would just--we have got to get to a point where that sword of Damocles is not hanging over our head.    Admiral Richardson. Sir, I am happy to answer your question, and welcome it on the acquisition and the need to speed that up. With the Secretary's encouragement, we started a number of initiatives that will get that going.    First, to address urgent needs and make sure we are not missing a trick, a technology or a solution. We have established a rapid prototype, experimentation, and development process that really has--will adjudicate those urgent needs or opportunities. It doesn't have to be expressed in a need, and will allow us to bring together technologies, engineer them together in creative ways, prototype them quickly, run through a bunch of options, get them out to the fleet sooner so that they are in the hands of sailors and Marines, and that is when learning really starts. We will figure out quickly which ideas have merit, which ideas just don't, which are dead ends.    And by doing that type of experimentation approach I think much more quickly, I believe, with confidence, that we will get to solutions that will translate to programs of record much more quickly, and we will be more competent in the technology that emerges.    Once they enter that acquisition stream, we are also establishing the Maritime Accelerated Capabilities Office, MACO, to allow a speed lane, if you will, for those programs that qualify, that are sufficiently mature, and can get to the fleet, to the delivery sooner. And so we are leveraging a lot of the techniques that the Air Force's Rapid Capability Office uses. And we look, by virtue of that, to get technology into the hands of the warfighter more quickly, and then gradually, transition more and more programs over into that speed lane, if you will, so that we can just respond at the speed of the environment, at the speed of technology, at the speed of our competitors.    Admiral Richardson. Sir, thank you very much for the question. With respect to the long-term future of Iran, just the geography of that region gives one concern, and Iran has been acting with malign intent across several different vectors, whether it is short-range or medium-range ballistic missiles, whether it is anti-ship coastal defense cruise missiles, you know, across the spectrum. And so we applaud the agreement that would eliminate a nuclear threat from Iran, from our perspective, so much has not changed in terms of what we have to do to watch Iran, secure that region for safe passage of the resources through the Strait of Hormuz, and operating in the Gulf.    With respect to the incident in January, it just shows you--first of all, those sailors, by international law, should not have been captured and detained. I think we made it very clear that that behavior is not consistent with international law. And, so, another indication of the type of threat we are dealing with there.    With respect to the details, the questions that you asked, that investigation is still in progress. We will get to every one of those questions that you asked for, sir. And we are looking at all of that. We have examined those boats. We are digging back down into exactly the concerns you have, and when that investigation is complete in the near future, I look forward to coming back and briefing the committee, in detail, on what we find.    Admiral Richardson. Month. We are talking months, sir, 1 or 2 months. I think we can get to that.    Admiral Richardson. Mr. Chairman, you said it. There is a lot of talk about this thing, that is why we need to go through the disciplined process of a formal investigation so that we can find the truth of the matter and address what we find.    Admiral Richardson. Sir, it is something we watch extremely closely. It does ebb and flow, not just with respect to the negotiations surrounding that agreement, but just in general. And so, if we may be seeing some kind of a local increase, it has not risen to any historical unprecedented levels, but it is something that we continually address as well, sir. We can't condone or even leave these situations unaddressed.    So I work closely with General Austin in Central Command and our Naval component out there to make sure that we are addressing those as they happen.    Admiral Richardson. Yes, sir. So I don't think a moment of comfort, and words like ``ownership'' and ``dominance,'' I asked my team to stop using that language, because it just doesn't keep us hungry enough to fight for every inch to maintain our superiority. I would say that if you look across the Navy, you can talk in surface, aviation, undersea, and also in the information domain, which includes cyber, the pace is the issue. And in every one of those things, as we strive to move into what I describe as maybe the fifth generation of warfare, we are outpaced right now. And so, that is why the Secretary and the Commandant and I are so focused on this aspect of speed, because while we do enjoy a margin of superiority now, that is perishable. And if we don't pick up speed in each of those four areas, we are going to be challenged.    This also includes high-end weaponry, that is why we invested almost $1 billion in research and development to look at advanced weaponry, so that our weapons are pacing this threat, pacing the environment as well. So it is really across the board. And if we do not come through these pacing issues, I just--I am concerned that we are going to fall behind.    Admiral Richardson. I can add on top of that, I think you identified that this is a program that is at the red line with respect to risk, and we can't afford to delay for a day the Ohio Replacement Program. Neither can we neglect to ensure that we continue to invest in the current Trident fleet which will be extended to 42 years, longer than we have ever extended any other submarine class. And so, it is the great work that goes on in Kings Bay and Bangor to keep those ships maintained and going back to sea so that they can conduct their mission, execute DASOs, those sorts of things that are absolutely critical. Then we are coming to the end of the number of Tridents that need to be refueled, but we need to continue to invest in our shipyards for that major maintenance that gets them into the second half of their life.    Admiral Richardson. Yes, sir. If I could just pile on to that a little bit. As the Secretary outlined, there is a people component to this, standing up the cyber mission teams that can respond to operations and warfighting in that domain. I will tell you, as you know, sir, it is game on in that domain. That is going on right now today. And so we are recruiting, training and hoping to retain that highly skilled workforce. I will tell you there is probably no place in the industrial base that is more competitive than people with these keen cyber skills. And so we are grateful for every one of those sailors that stays with us.    The task force cyber awakening did transition into CYBERSAFE. Our general approach, kind of at this level of classification is that we will look to harden the network, reduce its outward facing interface, reduce its vulnerability, its target service, if you will. So we will kind of harden the outer shell, reduce and harden that, and then nothing is completely leakproof in this world. And so we have got to be ready to detect any kind of infiltration through that barrier, and then respond to isolate that as quickly as possible. So that is generally how we are going. We are making some serious investments across the budget, the entire FYDP to get to that level of both people and infrastructure to support that.    Admiral Richardson. Sir, that is a great question. And so, in our large surface combatants are guided missile destroyers (DDGs) and cruisers. We have got a modernization program that really brings us into the fifth generation across the board. So from their combat system and combat radars, we are advancing into what we call Block 9 of the AEGIS combat control system, and we are on pace to do that as quickly as possible really. And so that has been a keen priority of us.    Similarly, in the electronic countermeasures world, we have got systems coming on to those to make them more resilient to withstand and prevent being hit by an incoming weapon.    And then, finally, as the Secretary mentioned, we are doing everything we can to repurpose and advance the offensive weapons that they carry. So repurposing the SM-6, for instance. And then, we are also enhancing the large surface combatants' ability to connect and work with other forces in the Navy, whether those be strike aircraft or other surface ships, submarines, networking that altogether so they can combine in new and creative ways. You have heard, I am sure, this concept of distributed lethality; similarly, we have the NIFC-CA innovative fire control counter air, which is the Navy aviation piece. We are looking to stitch that all together to one sort of integrated fires and effects network.    Admiral Richardson. Yes, sir. As we have discussed, the way we do that is by virtue of a force structure assessment which examines the combatant commanders' needs, the warfighting needs, and the theater campaign plan. It is really an aggregate of trying to figure out the demand signal. The last time we did that for the whole force was in 2012, and we refreshed it in 2014. But back then, we did not have a resurgent Russia, we did not have ISIL to contend with, the Chinese challenge was in a much different place. And so, I have directed that we open a recommission, we restart a study. We take a look at what are the current war fighting demands, the current demands, the missions that we are tasked to achieve, take into account the updated threat environment, and look forward to delivering that new Force Structure Assessment as soon as it is done.    Admiral Richardson. Yes, sir. I will tell you that we are really looking to, one, make sure that the shipyards are fully manned, and Congress has been very supportive. We are on track to hire up to 33,500 workers across all of the public yards. And so, that will address some of the aircraft carriers and submarines taking longer than scheduled to get out of maintenance. We are also investing in the shipyards' infrastructure, and, so, any additional resources that we can get just allows us to invest in that infrastructure faster, smooth out work lanes, and that sort of thing.    As well, many of our surface ships, non-nuclear surface ships, are maintained in private yards. A critical part of our industrial base is our repair yards. I have had a chance to visit many of those around the country, San Diego, Hampton Roads area, and they are terrific. But they also need to rely on consistent funding, predictable funding so that they can do the planning, and they can do the capital investment that allows them to get better as well and get our ships through on time. We are digging out of a hole in that area, in particular, in surface ship maintenance. It is critical we stay on this path. And so we very much appreciate the support of Congress there.    Admiral Richardson. Sir, I thank you for that question. We achieved perfect operational security, even we don't know what we are talking about. So thank you for that compliment.    The idea of area denial, A2/AD, is really generated by, again, our competitors taking advantage of some of these forces that are operating in the technology and information domain, where it is just becoming easier, much easier, to have a weapons system that can detect a target at great range, can assign a weapon to that target, and then strike out to hundreds of miles with great precision.    Now that takes an entire sophisticated chain of events to make all that happen. And as we respond to that, we are responding across that entire kill chain that we call. So you really have to, from the very initial detect to the end game, defeating any kind of weapon that is coming in, you have to dissect that entire sequence and take it down wherever you can.    You mentioned aircraft. Aircraft are a huge part of that. In terms of aircraft, you mentioned E-2D and the Growler, both of those play a vital part. They are fully supported in the budget, the fifth generation aircraft, the F-35, the Commandant mentioned the Marine Corps version, the vertical takeoff, we are asking for 10 more F-35Cs, the aircraft carrier version of that in this budget than we did in our 2016 request to kind of move ourselves into the fifth generation with respect to aircraft. And so, this budget fully supports looking at those technologies, it will help us defeat that anti-access/area denial type of a net with confidence so we can continue to have access wherever we need it to push the fight forward.    I would like to take a moment, too, sir. We have talked a lot about depot capability, and the Commandant mentioned this. Oftentimes we talk a lot about shipyards, but our aviation depots are absolutely critical to maintaining the ready aircraft so all of the pilots can fly. So just like in ships, we are making up for a backlog in, particularly the legacy Hornets and some of the helicopters that are working through depots. We are investing heavily in making sure the depots are funded to their maximum capacity. We are bringing on new artisans, and they truly are artisans that work on these aircraft. And we are also enlisting help from the private sector, Boeing and L-3, as specific to increase the throughput to get out of this backlog of maintenance and aircraft, and get more aircraft on the flight line that are ready to fly.    So additionally, because we have been flying the Super Hornets more, they are reaching the end of their life faster, so we have requested additional Super Hornets, both in 2017 and 2018, to help us get to where these F-35 purchases can start to pick up the load. And so it is really kind of a three-dimensional process, moving our legacy Hornets and other aircraft through the depots, buying some Super Hornets to help us accommodate and make up for the increased use of those aircraft, and then bringing this F-35, other fifth generation aircraft like the E-2D and the Growler that will make us relevant in that fight.    Admiral Richardson. Sir, thank you for pointing that out. And you make the point that just like traffic over the seas as choke points, you know, the Straits of Gibraltar and other choke points. So does our information system have choke points? It seems like when you log on to a computer, you have got access to the whole thing and it is free rein.    But as you pointed out, 99 percent of that Internet traffic travels over those underwater cables, and so they are vitally important. It is difficult to talk about this almost at any level in an unclassified hearing. But we are----    Admiral Richardson. Right. Yes, sir. But we are focused on that, you know, with a keen edge. We are working very closely with our team over in Europe. I talk to Admiral Ferguson and Admiral Foggo, our commanders over there, frequently about this. There is a homeland defense perspective of this, and so Admiral Gortney is the NORTHCOM commander, and he and I are completely focused on this mission.    Admiral Richardson. And sir, I just--you know, one more log on this fire. Where we can, you know, we do send assets down there. We were privileged to send the George Washington Strike Group around through the SOUTHCOM area, and all along, you know, both coasts of South America they worked intensely with the partners down there. They helped build their capacity and do a number of exercises, senior leader engagements, et cetera, to show our commitment to that super important theater every time we can.    Admiral Richardson. The very same, sir.    Admiral Richardson. Sir, if I can just byline a little bit. The Secretary mentioned that we are going to have the carrier strike groups spending more time in the Mediterranean addressing that. And they will be fully ready to meet those threats. We are going to--you know, that is the level to which those sailors and Marines train.    But we are only able to meet half the Combatant Commander demand right now. So as we adjust to both the Russian threat and ISIL, you know, that is going to come at the expense of somebody else. And so this is why we need to do this Force Structure Assessment all over again to determine what is the proper fleet size to allow us to get at the whole problem.               Closing Remarks of Chairman Frelinghuysen
