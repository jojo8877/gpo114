    Secretary Pritzker. I appreciate that.    Secretary Pritzker. So are you talking about our GOES-R program?    Secretary Pritzker. Right, exactly. OK. So we had----    Secretary Pritzker. What? Yes, why don't I let our staff talk to you about it, because this is one that I am not as briefed up on.    Secretary Pritzker. Terrific.    Secretary Pritzker. I know more about our Polar Follow and our GOES-R program.    Secretary Pritzker. Thank you.    Secretary Pritzker. Well, what we are trying to do at a large, philosophical level at the National Weather Service is as follows, is to make sure that we are not only collecting enough information, that the data is good and that we have information, but it is no good if we just know it. We have to be able to get it out to the first responders, to the emergency managers, to mayors, to governors, so that they can do something with the information that we have.    And so we are trying to evolve the Weather Service from one that is just focused on having the most accurate information to one that makes sure we are having the most accurate information and getting it into the hands of those people who can take action to protect life and property.    And so that means we need to think about making sure that we have our resources first of all as it relates to buoys and things like that, and data collection. In fact, in our budget request we are talking about trying to expand our Automated Surface Observing Systems to not only extend their life, but improve their functionality.    And in fact I have these great maps that the team did for me about the amount of coverage we have today and the amount of coverage we would like to have, so that we can have better data information that we think we can achieve and we have some money in our budget for that. The other is to improve our Doppler radar system.    But fundamentally, having good information is not good enough. I mean, if people are dying or property is being hurt, we need to make sure that we are getting that information to the folks on the ground who can do something with that information. Now, sometimes that means responding to a hurricane, but it also means a better understanding. What is going to happen, what kind of flooding, what kind of drought is being predicted, what kind of extreme weather should we be thinking is coming? And that is a lot also of what we are doing with the Weather Service.    So a weather-ready nation is one that is more than just knowing what the weather is going to be in the next hour, it is being able to get enough information early enough so that actions can be taken to protect life and property.    Secretary Pritzker. Well, Mr. Chairman, first of all, NOAA's ocean exploration program does very important work and, you know, both NOAA and I support the program that we do. What we are trying to do is weigh competing demands on our NOAA budget which led to us decreasing the request for that program. But what I would assure is we run a skilled program at the proposed funding level.    The other thing we do, exploration of rare earth minerals is something that is work that is supported by our proposal and will improve our knowledge of the possible location of these resources within our U.S. exclusive economic zones.    So we are trying to balance our budget here, but also to make sure that we are better understanding exactly what are the assets that we have within our oceans.    Secretary Pritzker. Terrific. Thank you.    Secretary Pritzker. It is a challenge. What we have done is we work with the Chinese. And I will begin with the Administration's position, which is this went all the way up to President Obama and President Xi, where President Obama and President Xi agreed that we would not tolerate intellectual property theft for commercial purposes between our two countries. And that was a very important marker to set down and something that we are watching very carefully as to what has occurred since last September when that agreement was reached.    And the second thing that we do through our dialogues and our work through the International Trade Administration, we work with China on, you know, I work with different companies that have various issues with the Chinese Government, raising specific issues as they arise with their government as it relates to intellectual property theft.    And I have been a consistent and strong voice for intellectual property protection as it relates to the Chinese. It is a challenge.    Secretary Pritzker. Well, the President has also created the ability to do sanctions against bad actors who are stealing intellectual property of our companies. And so that sits in place and the utilization of those sanctions is something that the decision to do that resides above my pay grade.    Secretary Pritzker. I will be sure to share that.    Secretary Pritzker. Well, you know, currency manipulation resides in the Treasury Department, addressing that, I think that is appropriate. There is one place where the hammer exists, if you will.    Having said that, the Customs bill, which you I believe will get signed into law tomorrow and you all passed, gives the Treasury Department and the Administration more tools to deal with currency manipulation and it is something that is very welcomed, frankly, by all of us in addressing those challenges.    We at the Department of Commerce particularly would deal with currency manipulation if it was brought up as something that was viewed as a subsidy, that is technically the way it would enter into the Department of Commerce's AD/CVD, our Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duty processes. But really most of the tools exist and the most useful tools exist at the Department of Treasury.    Secretary Pritzker. To be honest, that is not the big--I have heard there are selected industries that have raised that, but intellectual property protection is much bigger----    Secretary Pritzker . Much broader, of much greater concern to our industry.    Secretary Pritzker. I will have to get back to you on that and give you an outline of what has been done.    Secretary Pritzker. Absolutely understood. Thank you.    Secretary Pritzker. Absolutely.    So let me talk first about the 2020 census, which is at a very critical phase, as we are all aware. Our commitment is to try and save $5 billion, but in order to do that we have to spend money. And this is one of the critical years and that is why we have asked for a significant increase for the Census Bureau to $1.6 billion.    We released an operating plan for the census in October, that is three years ahead of what the 2010 cycle is. In our operating plan we detail what we are going to do and the milestones that we set out for ourselves for all of us to know whether we are on track or not to have a 2020 census the way we want.    And the thing about the 2020 census is we are trying to do four main things that are new. First is use administrative records. And if we want to use administrative records and we have gotten great access to many, many records, some of which though we would like to get access to that need legislation, but many that we have gotten, we have got to test the efficacy of using administrative records. We cannot just use them and hope that it is going to give us an accurate census.    The second is we are re-engineering the field operations to be more efficient, so that when we send people into the field we know that there actually is someone at the other end of the doorbell to answer the door.    The third is we want to collect more information over the Internet. As you can imagine, we need to make sure it is secure, we need to make sure we know the person who is responding is the person they say they are. And so there is a lot of testing that has to go on with that.    And, fourth, we have to have a communications plan with the American people that explains here is how the census is going to work in 2020. So there are a lot of things that need to be tested this year before we can do what we call an end-to-end test which has to be done in 2018 in order to lock down the census for 2020, make any final adjustments and lock down the census for 2020.    So this year, one of the things that we'll do is a very significant test in both Houston and in Los Angeles and we will also test-- we decided not to use the bring-your-own device but instead we are leasing devices where we're going to control the operating systems being used. All the software is our software, but this way we will also be able to control the operating systems that are being used.    So there is a lot that is happening with the census. The other thing that is important that we need to spend money on now is we are putting in place the technology and the systems to be able to assimilate all the information that we are taking in. That has to be completed and tested also now so that we know that that works at the time of the 2020 census.    So I think to date we are meeting our milestones. We work--my deputy is briefed monthly on where we are at. I feel that we are very--and I am briefed, you know, no less frequently than quarterly on exactly where we are at. So we are very much on top of it, we know what is at stake, but we need the money to be able to actually execute this year. So it is a very important year for the census.    As it relates to MBDA and your question about MBDA, we have proposed to add two programs. First is the minority--program for minority young entrepreneurs which is really--what we know is from research. If there are minority run enterprises in a community, there is less crime. So we need more minority run businesses in the communities that are having the biggest challenges.    So what we want to do is add youth business innovation centers in different communities. We want to have lab-to-market forums. We want to have venture capital forums in parts of our country that have received less attention as it relates to entrepreneurship.    So it is very exciting. It would be a Federal grant program that we are proposing and one that we spent a lot of time crafting. And one that, frankly, given the unrest in places like Ferguson and Baltimore, I think have the opportunity to help more businesses spring up in those neighborhoods.    Secretary Pritzker. Thank you.                                                                   Thursday, March 3, 2016.
