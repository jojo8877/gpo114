    Ms. Norton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I just have a few brief questions.    I am trying to find an industry standard, if you will, because it seems as if both the public and private sector are having the same kinds of problems. Daily news. Both sectors have it. States have it. Everybody has it. In part it is because, whether we face it or not, this technology is relatively new and we still are working our way through it.    I am wondering, don't we contract out most of this work, most of our work to contractors and vendors, as opposed to doing work in-house? I mean, I assume that NASA does work in-house, or maybe they even contract some out. But is most of this work contracted out?    Ms. Norton. Now, we in the Federal Government always use competitive bidding, do we not, for this work, as with other work?    Ms. Norton. Is that the practice in the private sector as well?    Ms. Norton. We often look to the private sector; we say there is real money there, there is real people here. Somebody keeps shareholders by real people, unfortunately. Is there an industry standard beginning to develop anywhere? Is there an industry standard in the private sector which could be useful to the public sector, or are both sectors simply feeling their way through these problems? Yes, sir.    Ms. Norton. Yes, of course.    Ms. Norton. We have always assumed that the Federal Government had the most secure level of assets and the rest of it have to make sure they are impenetrable. Can any of that cross over to other agencies and help them be more secure in their work?    Ms. Norton. Finally, the Affordable Health Care Act had a lot of glitches, but I haven't heard a lot about a lot of hacking there. Has that been shored up so, kind of information that is there, that that is fairly secure?    Ms. Norton. Have they been fairly rare?    Ms. Norton. Thank you.
