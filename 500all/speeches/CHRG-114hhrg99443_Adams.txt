    Ms. Adams. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Madam Secretary, for being here. I am going to move along quickly. I just want to give a shout out to my police department in High Point for the work they are doing in opioid abuse, and I thank you for your work.    Let me ask you about the health of our Nation's most marginalized young people as it relates to sexual health services. A lot of data and research performed by CDC, American Academy of Pediatrics, and even your Office of Adolescent Health show that far too many young people in the U.S. face barriers accessing and receiving adequate health care services regarding sexual health education.    So, can you please speak to existing efforts that HHS is leading to ensure that our Nation's youth, especially those most vulnerable, have the education, skills, and access to sexual education services?    Ms. Adams. One follow up. So, what is the administration doing to address not only the Southern States that are disproportionately affected by HIV disease, but also the rural communities that are seeing the majority of the diagnoses?    Ms. Adams. Okay. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I am yielding back.
