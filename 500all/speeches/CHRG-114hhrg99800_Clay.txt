    Mr. Clay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Professor Johnson, one of the areas of concern for me is: How do we best protect pensioners and retirees who, no fault of their own, stand to be hurt by severe reductions in pension benefits? Have you given that much consideration?    Mr. Clay. Thank you.    Mr. Weiss, the proposed legislation does a delicate dance with the creditors of the island nation. In its current form, will this provide the solution, or is there more work to do there?    Mr. Clay. Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, at this time, I will yield to my friend and colleague from New York, Ms. Velazquez.
