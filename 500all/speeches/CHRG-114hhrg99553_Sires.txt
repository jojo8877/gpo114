    Mr. Sires. Thank you, Chairman. I just want to say the chairman put together a great codel, which was very informative for me. We certainly learned a lot about especially border crossing in some of these areas that have nothing. They just go back and forth without any kind of scrutiny.    Can you define for me or discuss how the U.S. Government defines special interest aliens? How do you do that?    Mr. Sires. Because I am thinking we were in Costa Rica. We went with the President and obviously, Costa Rica is going through this issue with the Cubans and the Costa Rica Government coming through, but only 60 percent of those people going through there are Cubans. They said 40 percent were basically other nationalities, from Africa, from Bangladesh, Pakistan. Do you determine--how do you determine there which ones are of special interest to us?    Mr. Sires. In my view, a smaller number is easier to get through our borders because you tend to pile them up together with the other people.    Mr. Sires. But you know my concern, right? Sometimes they get bundled in with the rest. But you said, did I hear you correctly? You said special interest aliens, you have one set of definitions, you have another set of definitions. There is no one set definition.    Mr. Sires. I have other questions, but we will get to it later. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
