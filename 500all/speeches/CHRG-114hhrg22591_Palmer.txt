    Mr. Palmer. Mr. Chairman, I only have one question. According to a September 2015 inspector general report, the IRS spent $139 million in 4 years on upgrading its workstations from the outdated Microsoft XP to Windows 7, but you still missed the Microsoft April 2014 end of life deadline. I think you understand that using a supported version of Windows is critical to securing data. Yet according to a TIGTA report from September 28th, 2015, you have got approximately 1,300 workstations that you either cannot locate or you confirmed are running an old operating system.    My question is, where are you on locating those workstations and getting them updated?    Mr. Palmer. Well, just answer the one where you are on the status of locating those workstations and updating the software.    Mr. Palmer. Could you inform the committee where you are on that, and I would like to have that answer in 7 days. Can we do that?    Mr. Palmer. Mr. Chairman, I will yield the balance of my time to the chair.
