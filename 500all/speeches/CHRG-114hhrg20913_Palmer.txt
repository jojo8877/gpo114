    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Madam Chairman.    Mr. Khargonekar, the idea for the Small Business Innovation Research is to fund innovative technologies that the private sector may not be inclined to fund, in other words, address the problem of underinvestment in R&D. Is the program serving this purpose of it is focusing on proposals that are based on commercial viability, technical merit, or an agency's agendas?    Mr. Palmer. But are any of these grants grants or research dollars the private sector would have provided? Are you displacing private-sector investment?    Mr. Palmer. Is any of it driven more by an agency's agenda? And Dr. Lauer, you can respond to that as well.    Mr. Palmer. Thank you.    Dr. Dehmer, are any of the grants primarily determined by the Department of Energy's agenda or are they strictly looking at the research or the project?    Mr. Palmer. Can you get a little closer to the microphone?    Mr. Palmer. This is a question for all of you. The Inspectors General at federal agencies seem to identify and pursue instances of fraud and abuse in these programs with a fairly high degree of regularity. Are there facets of the programs that seem to invite wrongdoing? Are there identifiable characteristics that you look for for bad-apple applicants? Is there a way to vet these applicants to avoid fraud?    Mr. Palmer. What I'd like to know, Madam Chairman, in these cases where there have been abuses of the program, what our remedies are, if there's any effort to recover this, because we are talking about oversight over taxpayer money ----    Chairwoman Comstock. Okay. Thank you.    Mr. Palmer. --without----    Chairwoman Comstock. We're going to have votes here at 11:15 to 11:30 so I'm going to have to move on.    I now recognize Ms. Bonamici.
