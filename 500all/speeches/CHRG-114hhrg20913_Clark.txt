    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Chairwoman Comstock and Ranking Member Lipinski, for this hearing, and thank you to all of our witnesses today. We are delighted to have you, and I think your testimonies have underscored the immense value of the SBIR and STTR in making sure we're taking that research out of the labs and into the private sector. We're very grateful for you being here.    Dr. Dehmer, I'd like to go back to a program that you mentioned, which is the Phase 0 assistance program. As we see women increasingly--we're up to 30 percent of women who are owning their own businesses, and it's one of the fastest growing sectors, but we're not where we should be, especially with women of color, and I wondered, as one of the primary focuses of these programs is to encourage participation women and minority-owned businesses, I wondered if you could go into a little more detail on how the Phase 0 program benefits businesses that may be submitting a proposal for the first time and how you see the Phase 0 encouraging women and minority-owned businesses.    Ms. Clark. Do you know how many Phase 0 program participants have been successful in securing SBIR or STTR awards?    Ms. Clark. Thank you.    And Dr. Lauer, the National Academies 2015 assessment of the SBIR/STTR at NIH found that women and minority participation is ``low and declining.'' Are you aware of any changes or approaches that are being taken at NIH to address this problem?    Ms. Clark. Thank you very much.    And just very generally, Dr. Khargonekar, have you seen the discrepancy between NSF's overall funding level increases and the SBIR/STTR funding? Has that had an effect on NSF's mission?    Ms. Clark. And I agree with you. I think we need to increase the pie, not reallocate the slices.    But thank you all. Thank you for your testimony and your work, and I yield back.    Chairwoman Comstock. I now recognize Mr. Tonko for 5 minutes.
