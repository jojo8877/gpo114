    Mr. Carter. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank all of you for being here. We appreciate your presence here today.    I want to start with you, Mr. Brainard, if that is okay. As I understand it, at one point you were assigned in Iowa, is that correct ----    Mr. Carter. Right. Okay. Well, then, as I understand it, they tried to reassign you to Maine?    Mr. Carter. They tried to reassign you to Maine after you had ----    Mr. Carter. They reassigned you to Maine after you received all these accolades and all these awards?    Mr. Carter. Do you believe that that was their way of trying to get rid of you, to reassign your position?    Mr. Carter. Was it a bigger airport? Were you needed there or ----    Mr. Carter. Why would an agency take one of their best employees? Obviously, they wouldn't have given you these awards if they didn't think you were doing a good job and put you at a smaller airport where your skills and your abilities would not be as useful.    Mr. Carter. Now ----    Mr. Carter. Okay.    Mr. Carter. Okay. Well, let me ask you. And you did relocate to Maine?    Mr. Carter. When you relocated to Maine, was that a financial hardship on you?    Mr. Carter. And your family, I can assume it was.    Mr. Carter. Okay. Was there a vacancy near where you were before or ----    Mr. Carter. Okay.    Mr. Brainard.--to fill those positions.    Mr. Carter. Well, let me ask you. How much would it have cost TSA to relocate you to Portland, Maine?    Mr. Carter. I have got down here in my notes $113,000.    Mr. Carter. And is this happening elsewhere? Does this happen, Mr. Rhoades?    Mr. Carter. Okay.    Mr. Rhoades.--and the high cost.    Mr. Carter. Let me make sure I'm understanding this now. So this is taxpayers' money that we're paying this?    Mr. Carter. So we could potentially be talking about millions of dollars in taxpayers' money to put ----    Mr. Carter. And not only that, but it also causes the employee financial hardship?    Mr. Carter. Go ahead.    Mr. Carter. Okay. Well, we have got a number of moving parts here. You know, we have got what I consider to be wasting taxpayers' money I am very concerned about. We have got another concern about whether this is intentional and a way to get rid of employees or to discipline employees.    Mr. Chairman, I just have to tell you, I am pretty disgusted right now, and I am looking forward to us having another hearing. From what I understand, we are going to be doing that. And certainly, we want to get to the bottom of this.    Mr. Carter. Mr. Chairman, I will yield back, and thank you all again for being here.
