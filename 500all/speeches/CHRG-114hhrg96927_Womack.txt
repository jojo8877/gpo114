    Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your appearance today. Interesting testimony.    When I read your bio I think there is probably not a better person out there that could sit down in the Oval Office and have a conversation, with as much know-how and experience as you have based on your time at OMB, as a chief of staff and even as the architect behind a program like AmeriCorps that I have had some experience with, to talk about, to be of counsel to the President of the United States so that when he sends a budget--and I am the new appropriator on the Budget Committee--that when he sends a budget up, that it is something that we could all kind of rally behind and try to find some common ground on and that sort of thing.    So here is my question for you. When you sit down in the Oval Office with the President and you talk about the next 10-year window, particularly as it concerns deficit spending and the need for us to find meaningful and sustainable reforms in our social safety net program that we all know, everybody up here knows, is driving a lot of the deficit and contributing to our national debt, what is that conversation like? What advice do you give the President?    Mr. Womack. I will take that, I guess.    Yesterday, I went to the floor on a leadership hour and we talked about budget with a couple of my colleagues. I threw up a chart on mandatory spending and the squeeze that it is putting on the discretionary piece. As an appropriator, I have had a first-row seat to that, so I see the squeeze that is happening.    And in the not-too-distant future it is obvious to me that unless we have massive tax increases we are going to have a very difficult time addressing even the basic functions of government, including turning the lights on in this Capitol.    When you look at the net interest on the debt--and I know that it is north of $200 billion today--as you look at the 10-year window out to 2025, before my 2-year old grandson turns 12, and before my 8-year old can vote, the net interest on the debt is projected to be--in the President's budget--$785 billion. That is a staggering number. I would argue that it is an unsustainable number and that the markets will speak very loudly long before we ever get to $785 billion.    So how serious are you about looking at the mandatory side of spending, the two-thirds of spending that is on autopilot right now that is getting worse by the day, how serious are you about addressing that? And why do we not see a better depiction of it in the President's budget?    Mr. Womack. Mr. Chairman, can I ask one more quick question?    Mr. Womack. I know we are into someone else's time, Chaka's time. And I don't want to wear out my welcome.    Mr. Womack. Real quickly, a word about what you see in the near future on interest rates.    Mr. Womack. I thank the Secretary.    And thank you for the additional time, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
