    Mr. Jeffries. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    And I want to thank the witnesses for their presence here today and for very thought-provoking testimony.    Let me start with Ms. Espinel. There have been some concerns that have been raised by some of the people that I represent, and, indeed, many aspects of the American public about sort of the downside of development of big data, the privacy concerns with respect to this data being misappropriated, abused, and misused.    But I was wondering if you could speak to some of the potential upsides, the transformative nature of big data as it develops to improve, you know, the quality of life, or address social conditions or improve the functioning of the economy as we move forward.    Mr. Jeffries. Now, the international concerns that many on the panel have spoken to in the context of trade, and some of the court decisions that we've seen come out of Europe, I want to turn inward for a moment and ask you, Ms. Espinel, do you think that the United States, in the face of this exponential growth of data in such a short period of time, as it relates to that 98 percent figure, do we have an adequate legal and regulatory framework in place right now, or are there things that this Committee, that this Congress should be thinking about in this new data era that we exist in?    Mr. Jeffries. And in the limited time that I have, you mentioned the importance of American leadership, but you also said that it was important to develop international consensus. Could you speak to what some of the international challenges may be as it relates to how other international actors look at big data, which perhaps may differ than our view here in the United States?    Mr. Jeffries. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
