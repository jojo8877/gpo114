    Mr. Boyle. Thank you. I just have a few questions. When I was in Israel last August--well, actually, a few years ago and then again last August, folks I talked to including Israeli generals talked--they said not if there's a third Lebanon war but when there's a third Lebanon war, and that really struck me.    So my question was about the rockets because there's been quite a change even since I was there 7 months ago. The Israeli military that was briefing us had used the figure about 85,000 rockets. Then it was revised upwards after that to 100,000 and now I read upwards of 150,000.    So I guess two questions. First, where exactly do things stand now in terms of the amount of rockets and their sophistication. As I recall from 2006, the rockets that they had were not exactly precise.    So that's the number one, and then number two is what is our best intelligence that would be the event to trigger a third Lebanon war?    So I decided to ask all my questions at once and then leave it to each of you to figure it out which ones you'll want to take.    Mr. Boyle. My time has expired so I thank the chair and the ranking member.
