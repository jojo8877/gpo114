    Mr. PAULSEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's great to have you as the Chair of the Committee, and I'm happy to be on this Health Subcommittee now.    This has been great testimony, so I appreciate your time being here as well. On Monday I held a roundtable with several hospitals and organizations in Minnesota to talk a little bit about the regulatory environment they're dealing with, talk about Medicare programs.    And quite honestly, the lack of focus on outcomes in that environment and quality measures that they think really do need to be there, and they expressed some concern about some providers that are leaving the program and that patients are concerned about the quality and the cost of care that they're seeing.    Medicare was designed as an acute care program 50 years ago, so a long time ago, and clearly now obesity and other chronic conditions are driving a lot of the increased cost in the Medicare system today. And so, Dr. Moffit or Ms. Baicker, what would be the impact on the financial stability of the Medicare system if we improved the outcomes for patients that have multiple chronic conditions or we intervene sooner to help those patients from becoming obese or developing other co-morbidities.    Mr. PAULSEN. Ms. Baicker, real short, and then I'm going to ask a followup question real quick.
