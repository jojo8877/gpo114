    Mr. Zeldin. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman and Ranking Member Deutch, my mother's Congressman, Congressman Deutch. I thank you for holding this hearing today.    And my background before going into elected office was in the military, and first I was a military intelligence officer and then a JAG officer. And in our preparations, whether it is Iraq or Afghanistan or elsewhere, we focus on rules of law, rules of engagement, law of war. We are used to a conventional fight in the past, and we have a doctrine that should be respected when there is war. And the fact that you have Hamas living amongst neighbors, women and children, when you have an important, proportionate response, collateral damage ends up increasing when the threat lives with women and children. And I think that one of the things that we really need to tackle in the dialogue and the conflict between Israel and the conversation with the Palestinian Authority is the unnecessary collateral damage that is taking place. And the Palestinian Authority has a responsibility to route that out from within their ranks, and Israel has a responsibility as well. All of us do, whenever we are engaged in any type of a conflict.    But the amount of collateral damage and civilian deaths taking place across the borders from Israel is a responsibility of the Palestinian Authority to do more for Hamas not to live amongst the ranks of the women and children.    I thank you again, Chairwoman, for doing this hearing.
