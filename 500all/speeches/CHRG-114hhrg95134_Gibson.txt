    Mr. Gibson. Well, thanks, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the panelists as well and agree with some of the sentiment expressed by my colleagues earlier. This is an issue area where we have worked together. I think it is really a great news story. I appreciate the leadership of the Administration on that score.    I do want to echo some of the concerns about the information flow and the June 1 deadline, and I would like to perhaps address another facet of that, which is the challenge, of course, that you are having in completing all these and getting it back out. And I just want assurances that for those that did get their paperwork in prior to June 1, that if they have some inaccuracy on their application, they still get credit for having been sent in by June 1?    Mr. Gibson. Very well. That is reassuring. And then how is it going as far as just addressing the backlog?    Mr. Gibson. Well, thank you. I want to move now to the administration of the Forest Legacy Program, and I am curious on your feedback on this proposal. I guess it has been a little over a dozen years now, and I am just interested in the feedback in general about an important facet of a conservation program.    About a little over a dozen years ago there were a series of reports that really led to a policy change in pulling up to the state level, the management of easements as it relates to Forest Legacy. From my listening to folks, and I am from upstate New York, and then also listening to folks in LTA, it appears that the conditions may be set now where we could allow for states to make a decision as to whether or not we want land trusts to manage the easement.    The arguments that are propounded is that they have the resources to better manage these easements, and they make the case that they actually can get more benefit, more usage and benefit of the potential program. I am just curious what the thinking is at USDA of that potential policy proposal?    Mr. Gibson. Well, I thank you, and I think that, in general, that empowerment at the local level is one that we are going to find that benefits all. There has to be quality control, obviously, but I am looking at that proposal, and I do appreciate if you could take that back.    So thank you, Mr. Chairman.    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman, and I thank both the Chief and the Administrator for taking time out of a busy schedule and coming and being here. We look forward to continue--the Subcommittee and the full Committee--we look forward to continuing to work with you as we provide our function of oversight, and your leadership and work in terms of the implementation of the 2014 Farm Bill, so I appreciate your testimony, and we will dismiss you gentlemen, and I will call up our second panel. Thank you very much.
