    Mr. McNerney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you for coming to see us, Mr. Secretary.    I share my colleague from Illinois' concern about the nuclear waste lack of progress and the urgency to move forward on that. Are you still required to recuse yourself from questions on fusion?    Mr. McNerney. Good. Well, the superconductor technology advancements have presumably increased the progress of fusion. Could you talk about where we are with that fusion research? Is there any sort of timeframe where we can expect to see good results and maybe commercialization?    Mr. McNerney. Well, I am eternally optimistic----    Mr. McNerney. I would like to ask you about the DOE's effort to expand work on the water-to-energy nexus. What are the Department's priorities in that regard? And I am developing legislation sort of parallel to that, so I am kind of interested in this subject.    Mr. McNerney. Well, we should collaborate as well in our offices.    Mr. McNerney. I want to talk about carbon capture and sequestration. The technology has had some setbacks. I think one of the projects canceled. But, in my opinion, the coal industry, mining, coal burning in the future is going to depend on some sort of carbon capture and sequestration. Do you share that view that the future of the coal industry depends upon a good carbon capture and sequestration?    Mr. McNerney. All right. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.    I yield back.
