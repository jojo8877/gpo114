    Mr. Allen. Well, I have to tell my David Scott story real quick. But Kevin, all I can tell you is he walks the talk, because I had the opportunity to ride back to Georgia on an airplane and got to sit next to Congressman Scott. And he had his Bible open and, of course, we got into a discussion about his study and our faith journey. And I can't tell you, Congressman, how much I appreciate that opportunity to talk about how we could make a difference. Thank you, and thank you for walking the talk.    Mr. David Scott of Georgia. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back.    Are there others who want to be heard?    I want to thank our first panel for getting us kicked off in a great way.    We will now ask our second panel to join us at the witness table.    The Chairman. I would like to welcome our second panel now to the witness table.    We first have Dr. Juliette Bell, who is President, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, MD, outgoing chair of the Council of 1890s Executive Committee. We also have with us Dr. Cynthia Jackson-Hammond, who is President, Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio; and Dr. Paul Jones, President, Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia.    I would also again like to welcome the other Presidents and representatives of the other schools. During the question-and-answer period, Members will be able to ask questions not only of the witnesses at the table, but of any of the other guests who represent the 1890s schools.    So, with that, Dr. Bell, the floor is yours for 5 minutes.        STATEMENT OF JULIETTE B. BELL, Ph.D., PRESIDENT,                 OF 1890's EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,    Mr. Allen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And of course, what an honor it is to be here today and talk about our own Paine College there in my district, which was founded by the United Methodist Church, which I am a proud member of, and a proud supporter of Paine College, and of course, Fort Valley in our state as well.    And real quickly, I really don't understand why we are having problems at all universities recruiting folks in agriculture. I am a member of the Hephzibah Agriculture Club, and we had an extension agent that came down from Atlanta and talked to us. And he told a young lady who didn't know one end of a chicken from another, who, for whatever reason, decided maybe that is something she should get involved in, and he got her involved in 4-H and she started doing demonstrations; ended up getting a full ride to the University of Georgia on a poultry science scholarship; graduated top of her class. And she had like 12 offers in six figures to go to work in the poultry industry.    So there are lots of opportunities, and somehow we have to figure that out and get our messaging out and get our young people more directed into these jobs that we need to fill out there. Particularly in my district, it is cyber. It is all about cyber and high tech and that sort of thing. Somebody told me there are over a million job openings in that industry across this country right now.    So with that, my first question is, and, Dr. Jones, I will start with you. These universities were started for a purpose. And how do we stay the course by giving those who otherwise wouldn't have this opportunity to get the kind of education that you are offering? Because, obviously, Paine and Fort Valley and many others I have heard here today have outstanding graduates. How do we give those folks who otherwise wouldn't have that opportunity an opportunity to do this?    Mr. Allen. What I am saying, and I also serve on the Education and the Workforce Committee, somehow we have to get to these young people earlier. And my kids went to an inner city high school. We had 500 freshman in the high school and we graduated 250. What happened to those other 250 kids? It is tragic. How can we get to them when they are younger, some teachers tell me you got to get to them before middle school because that is when it goes off the charts.    But is there any strategy to get into the the 4 to 6 or 4 to 9 formative ages and get these folks on a career path and say, ``Hey, you have an opportunity here? This is why you need to get an education.''    Mr. Allen. Right. That is great news. Thank you. Yes.    Mr. Allen. You are on it. Great.    Mr. Allen. I yield back.    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.    Mr. Scott, any closing words?    Mr. David Scott of Georgia. Yes. Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. Thank you and your staff for pulling this hearing on the bill together.    But first of all, I would like to give a response to Congressman King's point because it is very, very important for everyone to know that this is an equal opportunity bill; no if, ands, and buts about it. It is very important for everybody to know that the 1890s were founded on the principle of equal opportunity, because the 1890s came to fruition because of the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decision which maintained that we have a doctrine of separate but equal. And the 1890s have been striving to be equal.    The one thing that has held the 1890s back is that they were never given the necessary resources to achieve that equality. We want to make sure to clear the air, and I may mention in each of the sections where Congressman King mentioned we mentioned African Americans, if I may state, that the title of this Act is the following: This Act, and this is page 2 of the bill, ``This Act may be cited as the `Funding for Student Scholarships for the 1890s Land-Grant African-American Colleges and Universities' ''. It does not say funding for African American student scholarships. We want to make that clear.    And where we do reference the African Americans, as he pointed out in three other areas, on page 3, we say: ``There is a great need to increase the number of young African-Americans seeking careers in the food and agricultural sciences''. There is inequality in the job market of careers because we have not had the resources to prepare the young people for that.    And then on page 5, it says: ``To increase the number of young African-American individuals seeking a career in the food and agricultural sciences . . . including agribusiness, food production, distribution, and retailing, the clothing industries, energy and renewable fuels, and farming marketing, finance, and distribution.''    And then finally, on page 5, it says: ``To provide scholarships to African-American students seeking careers in the food and agricultural sciences.''    So I wanted to make sure as we go forward, and Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned, we have two White constituents, fellow Members of Congress who are graduates of this institution. It is very important as we go forward that the record reflects that the 1890s and this bill is about equal opportunity for all, White, Latino, any and everybody that will come would have an opportunity.    However, we know of the shortage and the low number of careers in this burgeoning area of agriculture and agribusinesses that the African American kids are not allowed to get into. And that is where we referenced that, so that we continue to strive for equality. Thank you.    The Chairman. Well, I thank the gentleman. I thank the three witnesses for being with us today. I appreciate your patience with me trying to maintain the clock, but everybody has a lot to say on these important issues. And those who didn't get to testify, thank you for making the trip to Washington to be in support of this legislation.    As Mr. Peterson mentioned, this is our last hearing. This session of Congress will adjourn sine die shortly. And so we will need to start all of this exercise over again, as is the requirement of the House Rules that we form a new Congress altogether in the 115th Congress.    But I want to thank my fellow Members for the good work we have had. Hopefully, we haven't worn you out with too many hearings.    We anticipate in the 115th Congress we will have to take up the CFTC reauthorization. We will have to take up, of course, the reauthorization of the farm bill, and we need also at the front, harvest all of that great work that Jackie Walorski and James P. McGovern did on the SNAP 2 year review. That report is being released this morning. And so we have a lot of work to do in the next Congress. David, I look forward to working with you on that.    Under the Rules of the Committee, the record of today's hearing will remain open for 10 calendar days to receive additional materials and supplemental written responses to any questions posed by a Member. If there are things that you prefer to have placed in the record that you didn't get to talk about because we ran out of time with the clock, please submit those to us. We will put those in the official record of this hearing and then it will be a part of the work that goes forward when this bill is, I suspect, reintroduced in the 115th Congress.    With that, the Committee on Agriculture hearing is adjourned.
