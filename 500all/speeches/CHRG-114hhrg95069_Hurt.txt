    Mr. Hurt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the Chair for holding this hearing.    I come from a rural district, Virginia's fifth district, and it geographically largest district in the State of Virginia. So we know rural, and we also believe that a huge part of what we need to be doing here in Washington is adopting policies that give greater access to capital all across Virginia, all across rural Virgnia. Because obviously, the people you serve need better jobs, need better income. And that is obviously a part of what I think the focus on our committee should be. And I think it is.    I guess my question is, building on the chairman's questions about sort of the differences between now--I guess this agency was created back in the 1940s--and then. And then also, the difference between what your agency does in the context of HUD and VA programs.    I guess my question is, it sounds like you are supportive of the idea of consolidation and trying to streamline things. But from my understanding, the Administration began this or indicated that it was interested in a single family housing task force back in 2011. And I guess my question is, what is the progress, Mr. Hernandez, of this consolidation review?    And why on earth is it taking so long to develop some clear understanding of where we can streamline these programs and make them serve the taxpayers, as well as the target of the benefit. Once you answer, I would like to get Mr. Scire's comments as well.    Mr. Hurt. Do you support the idea that the Administration sort of led the way in 2011 in terms of consolidating and making these programs more efficient between the agencies?    Mr. Hurt. That doesn't sound like consolidation.    Mr. Hurt. That is what they said about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.    Mr. Hurt. Until it cost us $200 billion.    Mr. Hurt. Mr. Scire, please.    Mr. Hurt. Thank you. My time has expired.
