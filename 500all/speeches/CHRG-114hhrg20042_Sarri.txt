    Ms. Sarri. We do not have that number.    Ms. Sarri. I just do not have that number with me, so I want to make sure I give you an accurate number. I will try to get that right now.    Ms. Sarri. I think the director at one point had put an estimate of $6 million.    Ms. Sarri. As you know, that is in the----    Ms. Sarri. She has not told me yet. That is actually an EPA program, and so I would just encourage you to talk to EPA about why the cut was taken. My understanding is that there are some carryover balances remaining. That is part of the reason for a reduced funding level. But I think EPA is in a better position to discuss their budget.    Ms. Sarri. So just let me talk specifically to the Department of Interior's budget because we actually have $69.9 million. We are very supportive of the work the bureaus are doing in the Great Lakes. Obviously the additional money we get from the Great Lakes Initiative is incredibly important to our bureaus and that kind of cross agency effort. So there will be some impacts on it.    But as you know, it is kind of a competitive allocation among the different bureaus that participate or the departments that participate. It is not clear what the cuts would be in a future budget year since we would have to work on what the program would be like in 2017.    Ms. Sarri. Sure, I would be happy to. Thank you very much for the question. Within the Office of Policy Management and Budget, we have the Office of Law Enforcement and Security. It is the office that sets national policy across all our land management bureaus, and we look very closely at safety of our employees, also working with all the bureaus to do security assessments of their facilities.    We have some increases in the 2017 budget across all of our law enforcement bureaus. A couple of other initiatives that we are pursuing is along the southwest border obviously working closely with CBP, we have a lot of lands where drugs are smuggled across the border. We have worked on a southwest radio interoperability initiative there so we, working with other Federal agencies--Forest Service is part of that--make sure we have really good radios in place, and they are interoperable. We are looking into how we can expand that as a pilot across the Nation.    We have some increased money in the BLM budget for that purpose because they are kind of the governance structure for that to support all of the other bureaus. Efforts like that where we can improve our technology, get better interoperability are also things that both help keep the public safe and keep our employees safe as well.    Ms. Sarri. So the one thing I would also just mention is last week we did a framework on early detection and rapid response, which is actually very critical in terms of trying to have a national framework to look at addressing invasive species. But what the Park Service is requesting is $18.3 million overall for control and management, but I will get back to you on the record for specifically what is happening in Acadia.
