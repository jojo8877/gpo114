    Mr. Clawson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, for doing this hearing about such a tragic global situation. It is hard to even fathom. And I would like to reiterate the words of my friend, Mr. Emmer, I think it is time to bring home the African kidnapped girls and, you know, bring home the girls. And I know that is not the topic today, but bring home the girls. And we need to do everything we can on that.    To the guests, you all are doing more than just talking, and I respect action; so thank you for what you all do and the example that you set. And we ought to learn from that, and others ought to learn from that. And to Senorita Karlita, Karla .    Thank you.
