    Mr. Takano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Welcome, Mr. Secretary.    You mentioned a few times in your testimony that this is a simple proposal that allows for flexibility to reflect not only different business models, but also the innovation and technological advances some in the industry have made and continue to make.    How do you envision the industry reacting in terms of product offerings and tech-based solutions? And how will this help small savers?    Mr. Takano. But has this been borne out, the technology? My concern is that some would say, what I have heard from people in the industry, is that this rule will disincentivize people to help the small saver. And you are saying, well, technology will help offset that problem.    And I am just wondering, so Wealthfront has been able to build a market, they have been able to reach these small savers, the $10,000-a-year savers, I am just wondering whether or not if there is a test of this technology.    Yes, go ahead.    Mr. Takano. Okay.    Mr. Takano. I want to talk more from the point of view about the remedies for the saver who thinks that they have been deceived or misled.    At the end of the day, this rule is about guaranteeing Americans being able to make investments to retire comfortably. Can you tell me a bit more about the process for investors if they feel they have been misled?    You talked about the mandatory arbitration. But are there other remedies besides? I mean, arbitration may be a big part of it. Under what agency would they seek redress? Is it FINRA? Who is the--    Mr. Takano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
