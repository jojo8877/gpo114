    Ms. Chu. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chair.    Commissioner Koskinen, today, how many investigations have you been involved with regarding the events referenced in this impeachment resolution? Could you explain your personal involvement in each of these investigations?    Ms. Chu. What were the results of these investigations?    Ms. Chu. In fact, let's talk about the Treasury Inspector General. Could you describe what the working relationship is like between the staff at the IRS and the Treasury Inspector General. Are the results of the investigation by them generally considered nonbiased and reliable?    Ms. Chu. Uh-huh.    One major problem here stems from the decision of two IRS employees in a West Virginia facility to erase the backup tapes that contained some of the Lois Lerner emails. The inspector general found in its June 2015 report that no evidence was uncovered that any IRS employees had been directed to destroy or hide information from Congress, the DOJ, or the Treasury Inspector General.    Let me ask this: Did you make an affirmative order that those tapes be preserved? And did you ever make efforts to keep this information from Congress?    Ms. Chu. So you made several statements saying that those tapes should be preserved then, your office did?    Ms. Chu. Thank you. I yield back.
