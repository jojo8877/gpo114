    Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And I appreciate the patience you all have had with us this morning as we are running up and down to committees, hearings going on at the same time. So we have been in and out and you have been patient.    Dr. Hatchett, I want to come to you. Going back into February BARDA established the accelerator to support and research and development--and of course as we have worked on 21st Century Cures, we have been so interested in that, and then looking at the candidates that you were going to accelerate through this program with the drugs and vaccines and diagnostics and move that into development. And for us then moving it on to commercialization and into the mainstream.    I would like it if you could take just a minute and talk a little bit about the specific candidates that you all have put in that, about some of the vaccines or the microbials, some of the alternative therapies that you are reviewing in that program.    Mrs. Blackburn. OK.    Mrs. Blackburn. When you say a good response, quantify that for me a little bit.    Mrs. Blackburn. That would be great.    Mrs. Blackburn. OK.    Mrs. Blackburn. OK. And what is your expectation once you are able to populate the accelerator basically? Then how long do you think it will be before we begin to see next-generation products that are ready to go to the marketplace?    Mrs. Blackburn. Right. We----    Mrs. Blackburn. We understand that, but we----    Mrs. Blackburn. When we look at some of these drugs that are taking 10 years, 12 years to get through the process, and you look at the entire compendium and you look at what goes on with them, the innovators working with the FDA, our hope is that we are going to see your process work and help to push this to the marketplace sooner, that there will be some efficiencies. We know you have got some challenges, but we are hopeful there will be some efficiencies in moving it forward.    Mrs. Blackburn. Yes.    Mrs. Blackburn. OK.    Mrs. Blackburn. That is helpful.    Mrs. Blackburn. Right.    Mrs. Blackburn. That is helpful. That is what we want to hear. Thank you. I yield back.
