    Mr. Ribble. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hochberg, I will go ahead and start with you and then go on to Ms. Littlefield. Just to kind of give you my own historical perspective, I am a former business owner and I have voted in support of reauthorizing EXIM in the past. I am a little bit more sanguine today than I was 2 or 3 years ago and in part I am sanguine because of the CBO's fair value accounting method to determine the actual cost to the taxpayer.    I am going to quote from the CBO's 2014 report: ``For Fiscal Years 2015 to 2024, CBO found that EXIM Bank's six largest credit programs would generate budgetary savings of about $14 billion under FCRA accounting, but costs about $2 billion on a fair value basis.'' They then go on to say later in the report, ``In CBO's view, fair value estimates provide a more comprehensive measure of the cost of Federal credit programs and CBO has provided fair value estimates for many programs to help lawmakers more fully understand the tradeoffs between certain policies.'' That is a big swing, $14 billion plus to $2 billion negative over a decade. Would you care to comment on that?    Mr. Ribble. Wouldn't that go then to reduce taxpayer risk in case of default when the economy dips?    Mr. Ribble. What is the current interest rate that you charge your customers?    Mr. Ribble. And is that as well what the European Union's rates would be?    Mr. Ribble. You have heard the discussion between--it has been pretty widely publicized that Delta Airlines has got a problem because they want to buy Boeing airplanes and couldn't get it at discount. Air India got it at discount, not that they are competing. And so we gained jobs at Boeing, lost jobs at Delta. How do you respond to that?    Mr. Ribble. I see I am out of time, Mr. Chairman, so I will yield back. Mr. Littlefield, I will talk to you offline.
