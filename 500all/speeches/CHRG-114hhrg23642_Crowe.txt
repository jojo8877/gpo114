    Mr. Crowe. Yes, I'd be happy to.    Mr. Crowe. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, the ranking member, and the committee.    Mr. Crowe. I push this? Okay.    Thank you very much for the question.    First of all, I think we are mistakenly confusing a couple of issues. Opioids are not used to treat PTSD. A lot of folks with PTSD also have chronic pain conditions, and they may have started opioids to treat the pain, but opioids are not used by VA to treat PTSD.    We also monitor prescribing practices and send in experts to facilities where we think there's some mis-practice going on in an attempt to correct it.    We also--as you may know, we have the opiod rescue kits that now are being put in the hands of every veteran who's been prescribed opioids.    This is also a very personal issue for me. My sister died of an unintended opiod overdose, so I take this very seriously. But it's not part of our PTSD discussion.    Mr. Crowe. Dr. Chris Crowe.    Mr. Crowe. Senior mental health consultant and liaison to the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and     Mr. Crowe. Not necessarily. You know, I think they co-occur in many people. Folks who've been deployed, you know, have many opportunities for injury and come back with lots of musculoskeletal pain. Those also tend to be folks who've been exposed to trauma and may develop posttraumatic stress disorder. But opioids are never used to treat PTSD.
