    Mr. DeSantis. Let's get this show on the road.    Mr. DeSantis. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thanks to the witnesses.    So, obviously, we appreciate you looking into this. We know there is going to be a certain amount of waste, fraud, and abuse, unfortunately, when you have operations going on in this area. But did you get the approximate numbers on how much U.S. assistance inside Syria may have been lost due to waste or fraud?    Mr. DeSantis. What about fraud?    Mr. DeSantis. I think you have to view it differently. I mean, if you are in a hot zone and you have aid that is intercepted by terrorists, that is much different than if the money is just being frittered away. And so I think it is important for us to know the distinctions on there.    Let me ask you this, Mr. Melito. There have been a number of attacks on medical facilities and humanitarian workers in Syria. Did either USAID or State provide a list of all instances in which one of the belligerents in Syria attacked any of our partners delivering aid or seized any of our assistance?    Mr. DeSantis. So do you have an estimate on the numbers and the costs in terms of the assistance that has been implicated by any of those? I guess State didn't give you any information?    Mr. DeSantis. Okay. There are U.N. Security Council resolutions in place for accessing movement for humanitarian assistance inside Syria, but from your report, it seems that Assad's regime may be in violation of these resolutions. So how many requests do you know has the regime denied since the beginning of 2015?    Mr. DeSantis. So even if they are not actually denying it, they are basically undermining it with the process. And so how have State and USAID responded to those limitations?    Mr. DeSantis. The agencies that concurred with your recommendations, how long do they have to implement these and for you to close the recommendations?    Mr. DeSantis. Well, I thank you. I thank the witnesses.    And I yield back.
