    Mr. Posey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank the witnesses for their testimony today.    I just wonder if each of you would give me your definition of life.    Mr. Posey. Thank you. This question is for each of you. If you could pick a mission, this person would say I want a mission that will do this, achieve this, you know, what particular type of mission would you choose?    Mr. Posey. Y'all make the choices really tough, don't you?    Following up on the last answer, some people think because we've been to the Moon, we shouldn't return to the Moon. There's some--obviously some strategic reasons for going there for future transportation as a steppingstone to Mars, but I'd like to ask each of you your opinion of whether or not we still have a lot to learn from our own Moon?    Mr. Posey. I want to thank y'all again for your testimony. It's really been wonderful and I think everyone enjoyed it.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
