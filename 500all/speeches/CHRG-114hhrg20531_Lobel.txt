    Mr. Lobel. Thank you, Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Sherman and distinguished members of the committee for inviting me to testify today, and thank you for your leadership and the example of bipartisanship you set on this committee.    It is so critical because in the long run America will only be successful in countering the ideology of Islamic extremism if our policies have bipartisan support.    As the founder of America Abroad Media, I have spent almost a decade and a half developing partnerships with major media channels in the greater Middle East. Based on my experience, I would like to summarize my written testimony and underscore two main points today.    First, the focus of U.S. strategy should be on enabling, supporting, and amplifying the indigenous voices for progress in the greater Middle East. This approach will yield far better results than trying to manage a counter messaging campaign from Washington.    Second, the best way for the U.S. Government to support those in the Middle East who share a vision for positive change is by mobilizing the creative power of America's leading institutions--Hollywood, Silicon Valley, our philanthropy, our NGOs, and our universities--so they can collaborate directly with their counterparts in the region.    From my own experience, I can tell you there are many people in the Middle East today pushing for greater progress and pluralism and there is a critical mass of them in the media.    The most popular TV channels in the region reach tens of millions of people and have the highest credibility with their audience. Several of these channels are producing programs that seek to promote the values of pluralism and counter extremist narratives.    For example, one of our partners is the largest Pan-Arab channel--the largest--the Saudi-owned Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC). It is currently developing a large scale, 20-plus episode, anti-ISIS drama series based on real stories of young men and women who left their homes to join ISIS only to discover the reality behind their propaganda.    Last year, MBC aired a hit anti-ISIS comedy called ``Selfie'' which used the power of satire to expose ISIS hypocrisy. It was the number-one Ramadan show in the Gulf and had an audience exceeding 25 million.    Simply put, no U.S. Government channel or program in the Middle East, no matter how well intentioned or well produced, can come close to delivering this kind of reach or impact.    Young people in the Arab world today watch all the Hollywood movies and Turkish soap operas. But what they really want are more of these MBC-style shows, original Arabic language drama and comedy that reflects their own cultural storylines and meets the highest international standards.    And the creative community there have told me directly they want Hollywood support and guidance in order to develop more shows that meet their audiences' expectations.    They are asking for Hollywood writers to help them hone the storytelling and script writing skills that make American shows so successful. They want to learn from Hollywood's experience in order to develop world class Arab television and film.    My organization has already begun to help with this effort. I recently returned from a trip to Abu Dhabi with three of Hollywood's best storytellers, the award-winning producers and writers Ben Silverman, Greg Daniels, and Howard Owens. Happy to tell you more about them.    They led workshops with Arab TV and film writers and met with more than 100 of their counterparts in the creative community to share ideas for producing world class Arab drama and entertainment.    With more collaborations of this kind, we can unleash the creativity of Hollywood to help the Middle East develop a transformative entertainment industry that reaches tens of millions of people--of their people--with stories of hope and aspiration and advances the values we share.    In fact, the State Department has already taken some promising initial steps to catalyse greater Hollywood involvement in the Middle East. Last month, under the leadership of Under Secretary Rick Stengel and Assistant Secretary Evan Ryan, the State Department convened a meeting of high-level Hollywood talent, including our partners Ben Silverman and Greg Daniels, to discuss these very issues.    In addition to this convening power, catalytic funding from the U.S. Government could also make a tremendous difference. Due to low advertising rates, the entertainment market in the Middle East today is not commercially sustainable.    The U.S. Government could play a vitally important role by providing significant funding through grants and contracts that will enable the best creative content to succeed and become commercially sustainable.    With high-level attention, our Government can also inspire America's best philanthropic institutions to play a key role. For example, the John Templeton Foundation is already engaged in the Middle East through its well-respected Islam Initiative.    Several of our other leading foundations, such as Carnegie Corporation and the MacArthur Foundation, could all join together and have an enormous impact.    The vision I am outlining here is not new. In 2002, the Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World, chaired by former U.S. Ambassador Ed Djerejian, wrote,        ``An attractive, less costly alternative or supplement         to U.S. Government broadcasting would be the aggressive         development of media programming in partnership with         private firms, nonprofit institutions, and government         agencies both in the United States and the Arab and         Muslim nations.''    This programming can then be distributed through existing channels in the region. In the aftermath of the horrific Orlando attack, our country sorely needs a nationwide effort catalysed by our Government to counter the ideology of extremism.    But rather than trying to fight this ideology on our own, we should be empowering and amplifying voices that speak to the Muslim world more authentically and more directly. These voices exist and the media of the Middle East are ready to broadcast them. The United States should reach out to support and catalyse such programming.    Thank you for the opportunity to testify before your committee today.    Mr. Lobel. Congressman, let me go to a broader point, if I may. You know, when they looked at the radicalization process of one of the San Bernardino killers, her friends said, you know, when she was in college she wouldn't socialize. She spent all her time watching extremist television channels--24-hour television channels. I just want to echo some of the points made here that we should not focus exclusively on the online, and just two factors there.    One, I just want to quote from the Crown Prince of Bahrain who was referring to both Sunni and Shi'a channels. He says, extremists spread their ideological message through a multitude of channels old and new.    Satellite channels unseen by Western audiences and free of either its restrictions or regulations broadcast with far greater impact than the Internet, an almost continuous message of intolerance and venom to the ignorant and the susceptible. Some of the biggest social media successes--sustainable successes are television stars in the region who are on these channels.    So I just wanted to make the point that I think there is a complementarity here between the different types of media and we need to be looking at all of it together.    Mr. Lobel. Over the years our organization has had a range of funders, largely private foundation supporters and we have also received some U.S. Government funding as well.    Mr. Lobel. Well, I think the government can play an important role by catalysing that, by--it can mobilize the private sector. It can mobilize patriotic individuals in this country who I think recognize the danger and are willing to step up and I think there are some who feel like they haven't been asked.    So that's why I think there is an important role that can be played here in Washington by our Government in helping. So I think the short answer to that is yes.    But sometimes you need that initial start, that venture capital funding, if you will, particularly because of some of the commercial challenges in the region.    Mr. Lobel. I would just say quickly, Congressman, that if you look--it is striking when you read the history of the Cold War is how often projects were launched that really directly involved the best of America's private sector and civil society.    That is striking. I don't think we have achieved that equivalent in the 15 years since 9/11.    Mr. Lobel. We should be spending a lot more money on all of these efforts. I think when we look at the ideological challenge and the importance of quote, you know, ``soft power'' in addressing it, I think it would be clear that there is a great mismatch between the challenge and the resources being allocated overall.    Mr. Lobel. I agree wholeheartedly that not only our Government but our country as a whole has not invested nearly enough in the kind of regional knowledge and expertise required to address this challenge. That includes an understanding of Islam.    So that, to me, is the State Department and the rest of us. So, you know, when we look back at what was invested in Soviet studies probably in the first 15 or 20 years of the Cold War and compare it to where we are today we are failing and that is an important cause of the fail.    Mr. Lobel. I would just add very briefly that the 14 layers of review is exactly when you think about yes, there needs to be more money but how that money is spent, you wouldn't want to be spending it on 14 layers of review.    You want it to be going to entities around the country that can really make a difference and are not as risk averse.
