    Ms. MENG. Thank you, Ms. Olson, for being here today.    My question stems from occasional inquiries that we get from some of our constituent small business owners who obviously many of them have fewer resources to spend on accountants working on complex tax problems. One of the issues, obviously, is worker misclassification but there are different issues that they face.    I wanted to ask, what can we do to put small businesses on a more level playing field to help them? In the interest of time, part two of my question is what types of compliance or assistance services are available or maybe studies that have been done that could help us better assess the problem?    Ms. MENG. Then finally, in terms of businesses and people just being more technologically savvy, are there apps or software available that could, in a quicker way before IRS may develop some sort of policy to geographically help them, to be able to help them either track their workers or help them more fully comply?    Ms. MENG. Thank you. I yield back.
