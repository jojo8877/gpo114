    Mr. HANNA. A couple of quick things. You are doing a great job, incidentally. It is wonderful to hear you speak.    The 22 cases, $333 million, can you describe to me what that looks like in the real world? How that can even happen? Why should someone have to be prosecuted criminally to eliminate them from a loan organization that is designed to help people? You know, there is a national group. Frankly, we would like to have the cap raised from the $21 billion I think it is today, even higher. It is hard to justify or it is going to be more difficult with this kind of fraud. But should it be necessary to have somebody prosecuted criminally in order to get them debarred?    Mr. HANNA. The next question is, if it is that easy, why is it that you need to be the person to identify this? That you need to be the person, the organization, actually, to see that this is done? If I were running the SBA and I had credible suspicions----    Mr. HANNA. Go ahead. You know where I am going.    Mr. HANNA. Okay, so the question is, is there a cultural problem?    Mr. HANNA. Well, you seem pretty scary to me.    Mr. HANNA. So is there something that you might advise this Committee to do to kind of open that opportunity for them or reinforce--they should not have to go through this to get to that point.    Mr. HANNA. Thank you, Chairman. I yield back.
