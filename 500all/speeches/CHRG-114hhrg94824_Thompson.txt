    Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Chairman.    Mr. Hewitt, what were the factors that led you to believe your union officers had become unresponsive to your concerns? And under what circumstances would you financially support a union?    Mr. Thompson. My follow-up question was under what circumstances would you financially support a union?    Mr. Thompson. Sounds like there may be a little bit of a bias there if the representation you had to hire was those you had a grievance with. Thank you, sir.
