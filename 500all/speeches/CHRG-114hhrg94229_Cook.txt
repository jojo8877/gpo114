    Dr. Cook. 6.2 on July 1.    General Klotz. So later this year we will take the next step in that process. So this is something which we take very, very seriously.    Mr. Cook. Happy to do that. By ``interoperable,'' which is part of the three-plus-two strategy, it is an agreed Nuclear Weapon Council strategy to move eventually to three interoperable ballistic missile systems. That brings down, in the long haul, some of the technical hedge that we carry to provide a backup against technical failure for what we have, and more importantly, as weapons age. Specifically, it means the ability to have a common nuclear explosive package fit into each of the large air shells, one for the Air Force, which is the Mark 21; one for the Navy, which is the Mark 5, to do the adjustment and all of the balancing required for flight characteristics with the non-nuclear components. And we pursued this year after year. It is well beyond the stage of conceptual.    Within the last 12 months, we believe that we have proven, to the best extent on paper that this is possible, and now we will begin maturing the technologies in order to resume the schedule. As the Administrator said, there was a 5-year delay in IW-1, in other testimony, and some money is shown in the fiscal 2020 year budget to resume that work.    Mr. Cook. You are looking at--the expectation for the plutonium is to have most of the capabilities in for the first part of the strategy by 2020, and for the second part by about 2025. We will execute a buildup, in a rational way for capability at 10, 20, and 30 pits per annum and 24, 25, and 26. We will achieve the capability with plutonium and demonstrate at the 50 to 80 level in 2030 that capability.
