    Ms. Matsui. Yes, just a minute or two.    Ms. Matsui. I was curious, I wanted to ask Mr. Slinger some questions. I find what you are talking about very interesting because I look at this, and what you say is all very important about deploying broadband infrastructure, and I am from Sacramento, so we have wonderful areas that are doing great things. I am looking at a particular area in our city that is economically deprived, and we have a light-rail station that is going to be--a light-rail line that is going to be completed there with fiber and transit-oriented development stations. But yet we have schools and libraries that are just deprived and businesspeople there who just have no access. If we were to do something there, and I don't know whether we can have a special project, but I'm looking at this being very, very special for economic development. Is that something that we can provide the access, as you say that you need, is that something that you or somebody else can take on as a project working with us? Because I am trying very much to help this area that feels very deprived, looking at the rest of my district that feel like they are on the move and they are not on the move, and I want to get them on the move if there is something we could do there.    Ms. Matsui. OK. Well, thank you very much, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.
