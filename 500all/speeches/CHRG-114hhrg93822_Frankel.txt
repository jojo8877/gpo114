    Ms. Frankel. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here today.    Well, it does sound like the one thing that we all agree on is that Iran should not be able to get a nuclear weapon. I have a couple of questions. I want to--if I could just state them first and then you can answer.    First--my first question is if there is no deal, how long would it take Iran to--at this point, do you think, to break out to have a nuclear weapon?    It is interesting because I hear the frustration of so many of my colleagues about, you know, not trusting Iran. I think we--no one trusts Iran. But if we do not get a deal, we do not get a deal, is the alternative--the realistic alternative a military operation?    What would that look like? And if there was a military operation, how long do you think that could delay Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and what do you think would be the interim collateral damage? I mean, what would you--I am sure you have discussed this.    You know, what is the scenario of not having a deal? Now, and just to add to that, you have said, well, if there is no deal, then we are going to increase the sanctions. But I am assuming that you have made the calculation that we have taken them--that this is a time to get a deal. So you can respond to those thoughts.    Ms. Frankel. And, if you could, because I am sure you have talked about this, what would be the ramifications especially in the region if all of a sudden there was a war with Iran? What would be the consequences, for example, to Israel? What would you expect?    Ms. Frankel. But would you--would you expect further acts of terrorism?
