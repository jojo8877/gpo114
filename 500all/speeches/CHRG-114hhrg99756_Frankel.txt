    Ms. Frankel. Thank you, Madam Chair.    I just thank you all for being here again, once again.    I had the honor of traveling with our chair, Mr. Royce, this past week. We were in Jordan, Iraq, and Tunisia, and it was quite an enlightening and rigorous schedule. Madam Chair, my back is still hurting from the body armor really.    But some takeaways. It is not only the threat of terrorism, which is real in so many of these countries in the Middle East, but they are in terrible economic crisis, to the point where--I will use Iraq as an example. I mean, they are not even able to pay for their own army.    There are a lot of moving parts, but what was very clear to me, No. 1, our own security and the security of allies, not only in the Middle East, but in Europe and other places, will be affected greatly by the stability in the Middle East.    My second takeaway was that, or this may be my third takeaway, is that our leadership is absolutely needed. There is no question about it, not only from a military point of view, but just in terms of economic development, education, humanitarian, other humanitarian assistance.    So, I very much look forward to what you have to say this morning. And again, thank you for your service.
