    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here today.    I want to turn towards the preschoolers and early education, and specifically parts B and C of the IDEA Act. As you know, they are absolutely critical to addressing the needs of our young children from birth through age 5 who experience learning challenges, including, you know, they provide support for preschools as well as State infrastructure for early screening, referral, and intervention. I was delighted to see a modest increase. You know these programs could use even more, but we are grateful for the Department in doing that.    Can you address the priorities in the area of early education, but specifically for young children with disabilities?    Ms. Clark. Wonderful. Thank you.    I also wanted to ask you and follow up on some of my colleagues' questions around year-round Pell grants, which I am certainly hearing from my community colleges in Massachusetts are critical.    And as we are looking at curriculum for community colleges really with an emphasis on stackable certificates, so that our students can get to that first job, I wonder how you see sort of -- do you see any tension with your On-Track Pell Bonus potentially between encouraging students to take a certain number of credit hours versus getting that initial certificate that may allow them to start on a career path quickly?    And some of the issues that I've heard coming up are really the need for flexible ways that students can sign up for class time, whether that be a longer class that doesn't meet as frequently or a Saturday class, so that they can provide for their families while furthering their education. I just wonder if you could address that.
