    Mr. Walker. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I do not have specifically a question today, but I do have a comment that I would like to submit in the record for Administrator Fugate. I wanted to take a moment today and thank FEMA and the men and women working to respond in our specific times of need in North Carolina.    In fact, our Governor, Pat McCrory of North Carolina, has only the best to say about the work FEMA has done in North Carolina following Hurricane Joaquin, and we cannot thank you all enough.    Last, I would like to finish today by recognizing Michael Sprayberry on his appointment to the FEMA National Advisory Council. Mr. Sprayberry is the emergency management director for the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, and I feel the council made an excellent decision to bring him on board. Again, thank you, Administrator, for your work along with the rest of the Members.    I yield back, thank you.
