    Mr. DeSantis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you to the witnesses.    When we have victims of cyber attacks, one of the issues is attribution. Where did this come from? I know that they emanate in Eastern Europe, Russia, China, whatever. So how do the agencies work with Homeland Security, the FBI, and other law enforcement in order to trace attacks back to the source when they happen?    Mr. Scott, do you want to give that a shot?    Mr. DeSantis. So that would be the type of thing if it was an attack on someone's bank account, they would inform the Secret Service, let's say?    Mr. DeSantis. How are the agencies managing mobile device security? I know that when I was active duty in the military and you put in your CAC card, there are all these encryption certificates, everything. But if someone just has a mobile device and they want to conduct business on that, how do you ensure that that is something that has integrity?    Mr. DeSantis. And if that is not used, then there is more vulnerability to a cyber attack?    Mr. DeSantis. So there are policies? Are employees limited in what they can download onto the mobile device?    Mr. DeSantis. What about are employees are allowed to kind of just do their own email, apart from the Federal Government?    Mr. DeSantis. Would an employee, if they just had their own email server, could they just use that, or would you make them use the Government system with the protections?    Mr. DeSantis. Thanks.    I yield back the balance of my time.
