    Ms. Granger. The Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs will come to order. I want to welcome all the Members to the first subcommittee hearing of the 114th Congress. The purpose of today's hearing is to oversee funding within the State, Foreign Operations Subcommittee's jurisdiction to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the Ebola outbreak.    I would like to welcome our three witnesses, Ambassador Steve Browning, Special Coordinator for Ebola at the Department of State; Mr. Dirk Dijkerman, USAID Executive Coordinator for the Ebola Task Force; and Mr. Jeremy Konyndyk, Director of USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance.    Thank you all for being here.    Although the international response was slow at the beginning of the Ebola crisis, the level of effort by the United States has been unprecedented. More than 1,000 American troops are currently deployed. The CDC has public health professionals in the affected countries. Our diplomats continue to work with governments to contain the outbreak. USAID leads the response on the ground. There are also hundreds of brave healthcare workers, many of them Americans, who have been mobilized by nongovernmental organizations to respond to the disease.    The results of the response effort are staggering and much different than expected. In September, scientific models predicted that by January of this year there would be 550,000 Ebola cases in Sierra Leone and Liberia. I will repeat that number because I had to check it because it is so astonishing: Predicted 550,000 cases.    Those of us who watched the progression of this disease from the beginning and witnessed its devastating effects are all thankful that the actual caseload was nowhere near what was predicted.    The press reported 124 confirmed cases in West Africa last week, one of the lowest levels since the outbreak began, and the total cases reported in those countries is approximately 22,000. This is a fraction of what was predicted.    The administration has announced that almost all of the U.S. troops in Liberia, which peaked at 2,800 in December, will come home by the end of April. One hundred DOD personnel will remain to help the Liberian military and governments in that region.    But the fight is not over. As our troops come home, the difficult work of eliminating the disease will fall even more on the shoulders of aid workers on the ground. Effectively addressing this next phase of the epidemic is critical.    As we all saw last year, when the disease came to our own shores, just one case could have devastating effects. Last fall, my home State of Texas experienced the disease directly.    The Fiscal Year 2015 Appropriations Act includes $2.5 billion of emergency funding in this subcommittee's jurisdiction, representing a clear commitment by the Congress on behalf of all Americans to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and prevent the further spread of the disease.    It is this subcommittee's responsibility to oversee funds provided to fight the disease, to ensure there is a solid plan for spending resources, and guarantee that any lessons learned from this crisis can be applied to future global health emergencies.    I hope the witnesses can give us an update on how funds have been spent and how remaining funds will be prioritized to eliminate the threat of Ebola. We also appreciate your thoughts on how we can respond more quickly and efficiently in the event of another international health crisis.    We commend the U.S. military and government agencies who have responded to this crisis, but we must ensure that there has not been unnecessary duplication of effort. If so, we need to change course now and not wait for the next crisis to get it right.    I want to close by expressing my sincere appreciation for the healthcare workers who fought the Ebola outbreak and cared for those in need. They take risks every day that many of us never have to face. They are heroes, and some of the stories I have heard are truly remarkable.    I will now turn to my ranking member, Mrs. Lowey, for her opening remarks.    Ms. Granger. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey.           Ms. Granger. I will now call on the witnesses to give their opening statements, and I would encourage each of you to summarize your remarks so we can leave time enough for questions and answers. Your full written statements will be placed in the record.    We will begin with Ambassador Browning.                Opening Statement by Ambassador Browning    Ambassador Browning. Thank you very much, Chairwoman Granger, Ranking Member Lowey, and distinguished members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the U.S. Department of State's efforts to combat the ongoing Ebola epidemic and use of the recently appropriated funds.    The Ebola epidemic in West Africa has already resulted in over 22,000 Ebola-infected persons and over 9,000 deaths. While Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea have been affected the most by this epidemic, there have been cases in several other countries, including the United States. The three affected countries have borne and will continue to bear huge economic losses as a result of the epidemic.    Thank you for appropriating funds toward defeating Ebola in West Africa. We appreciate the commitment and support your demonstrated efforts toward the response.    Though the current case rate is falling, there is a long way to go. And we have to remember that one undetected case can start another outbreak. Last week we saw a rise in the number of cases in the region over the previous week, from 100 to 124, a reminder that we are not on a smooth glidepath toward zero new cases, which is the goal we must achieve.    The United States has responded at home and abroad by implementing a whole-of-government strategy to lead the global effort on Ebola. With USAID as the lead agency for the international response, the Departments of State, Health and Human Services, Defense, Homeland Security, and other supporting agencies have worked together to combat the spread of the Ebola outbreak. DOD's mission in Liberia in support of the civilian response has essentially been completed. And we can be confident that Liberia will continue on the right track with robust civilian response that we have in place there.    Our Ambassadors and Embassies Monrovia, Freetown, and Conakry have been essential to coordinating U.S., host government, and international partner efforts. U.S. Ambassador to Liberia Deborah Malac, U.S. Ambassador to Sierra Leone John Hoover, and U.S. Ambassador to Guinea Alexander Laskaris, and our interagency teams, both American and local staff, have worked tirelessly to help keep Washington abreast of all events on the ground, while encouraging their host governments to improve their responses.    Additionally, our Ambassador to the African Union, Reuben Brigety, and his team were instrumental in convincing countries throughout Africa to provide assistance, including much needed healthcare workers. All four Ambassadors have displayed tremendous skill managing U.S. Government response on the ground.    The Department has focused its energy on diplomatic engagement to increase international support for the Ebola response as well as improving coordination with the U.N. System, all the governments involved in providing resources, and international government and nongovernmental organizations. We have used every opportunity to impress upon the international community the necessity of joining together to win this struggle.    State has also encouraged nongovernmental actors to join the Ebola fight. We have worked to identify stakeholders in the diaspora and private sector to devise ways to help. The State Department has supported the United Nations system in their response to Ebola. In mid-September, senior U.S. Government officials began high-level outreach calls to other governments, who have now committed a total of nearly $800 million to the fight against Ebola in response to this call. In addition to funding, many countries have committed essential personnel and other resources.    And I brought fact sheets that describe the work of the broader international community, which I would like to have submitted for the record.    It is essential that we focus on the immediate response until the epidemic ends. However, all humanitarian crises require a recovery period. In addition to the immediate response, we must ensure regional preparedness and rebuild health systems, not only in our tradition of humanitarian assistance but to protect ourselves from future infectious disease threats.    The U.S. Government is working to improve preparedness planning, both internally and with the international community. The President launched the Global Health Security Agenda 1 year ago to accelerate global action to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to infectious disease threats, whether naturally occurring like the Ebola epidemic or the result of bioterrorist threat.    State and USAID are participating in an interagency effort focused on post-Ebola recovery and will work with international partners, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations to support sustainable recovery within the region.    I would like to close with remarks from the President, who stated, ``This disease can be contained.'' It will be defeated. Progress is possible, but we are going to have to stay vigilant, and we have got to make sure that we are working together. If we don't have a robust international response in West Africa, then we are actually endangering ourselves here back home.    Thank you for your time and consideration. I welcome the opportunity to answer any questions you may have.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.                 Ms. Granger. Mr. Konyndyk, you are now recognized.                   Opening Statement by Mr. Konyndyk    Ms. Granger. Mr. Dijkerman, you are now recognized. Thank you.    Ms. Granger. Thank you very much. We will now go to questions, and now you can see how much time you have used. If you will limit the length of your question, we will have time for two rounds. I know people are very interested in this hearing, and I will begin with the first question.    The Ebola response in West Africa required contributions of several U.S. Government agencies, not just those represented in the room. The Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been key players.    Ambassador Browning and Mr. Konyndyk, as the response evolved, how did the administration ensure there was coordination among the agencies and no duplication of effort? And are there more changes that need to be made? What lessons have you learned from this crisis? And what should be done differently in future global health emergencies?    Ambassador Browning. Thank you very much. I think the key point is that we initially recognized the comparative advantage of the various agencies. In my own work in Uganda, when we were rolling out PEPFAR, we learned very quickly that CDC has strengths; USAID has strengths; DOD has its own abilities. And the administration looked to these agencies to use these comparative advantages when we first responded.    USAID has the lead on the ground, and through their DART teams, their disaster emergency response teams, they coordinated the activities of all the various agencies. As far as back here in Washington, it was a very emotional, chaotic time. And we were looking for the best way to respond. Eventually the administration decided to bring on board Mr. Ron Klain, who helped bring together all of the agency responses and provide some structure to our response.    Ms. Granger. Thank you very much.    Ms. Granger. Thank you very much.    I will now turn this over to Mrs. Lowey for questions. Thank you.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Ruppersberger.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Crenshaw.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Serrano.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Stewart.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Fortenberry.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Dijkerman, prior to the Ebola outbreak, the administration launched its Global Health Security Agenda, and it designated CDC as the lead. I understand that USAID and CDC plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to ensure that health systems are able, to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious diseases, such as Ebola. Could you describe the coordination and the division of duties between USAID and CDC?    Ms. Granger. Ambassador, do you have something to add to that?    Ambassador Browning. I do. I think it more of a whole-of-government approach, then, as indicated, with CDC in the lead. This is very much a whole-of-government approach. And let me use an example from my previous experiences. When I was Ambassador in Uganda, we built PEPFAR at that time, 10 years ago, and part of the process was using CDC to help train lab technicians and public health administrators, and also USAID in the delivery of direct health care. Ten years later, now in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, we have U.S.-trained Ugandans who volunteered to come to these Ebola-stricken countries, used the skills and the practices that we gave them 10 years ago. This is the concept behind GHSA. Build this capacity in these countries throughout the region so that if this happens, when this happens again, they will be able to respond much more robustly than they were this time.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mrs. Lowey.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Ruppersberger.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Serrano, you have the last question.    Ms. Granger. I took notes.                                      Wednesday, February 25, 2015.                Opening Statement by Chairwoman Granger    Ms. Granger. The Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs will come to order.    Mr. Secretary, I welcome you back to the subcommittee. There are many serious foreign policy matters and budget issues that Members will want to address with you during our time. We look forward to your testimony.    At the top of the list is addressing the threat of the Islamic State and terrorists affiliated with ISIL. As Egypt, Jordan, and the Kurds in Iraq are retaliating and defending themselves against the group's heinous acts, security assistance is being delayed by bureaucratic processes across many agencies and poor policy decisions by this administration. As a result, our most trusted and capable partners in the region are not getting the help they need.    Mr. Secretary, there are no excuses for this delay. I know that this delay is not your responsibility alone, and I have voiced my concerns directly to the President, as you know. Our allies and partners in the Middle East must get the help they need now to combat ISIL--not next week, next month, or next year.    In Ukraine, violence continues despite a ceasefire that was reached almost 2 weeks ago. We want to hear your thoughts on steps being taken to resolve the situation and what assistance is needed to support the people of Ukraine and the region to combat Russian aggression.    In Afghanistan, even with a new government in office and a signed bilateral security agreement, there are continued challenges, and, in fact, the security environment remains so unstable that our diplomatic and development personnel are pulling back to Kabul.    In Africa, Boko Haram has not backed down. They are still on the offensive, committing unspeakable acts of brutality. And while there has been progress in ending the violence caused by the Lord's Resistance Army, the leader of the group, Joseph Kony, remains at large.    For nearly a year and a half, you have worked with our international partners to put in place an agreement with Iran, and the United States must keep the pressure on as a final deal is negotiated. I am closely watching the elements of an agreement. I know many of my colleagues share my concerns. The security of the United States and our steadfast ally Israel is at stake.    I hope you will address each of these policy issues today.    In addition, we have questions about the budget request for your department's operations and foreign assistance programs. The total funding level requested for the State Department and USAID is 6 percent above last year, but, even at that level, you have sacrificed some of the priorities of members of this committee to make room for the administration's initiatives.    It is difficult for me to justify a new $500 million program at the United Nations to fight global climate change and additional funding for an embassy in Cuba when, once again, many programs that have bipartisan support have been reduced below last year's level, such as democracy assistance and humanitarian programs.    Another issue we will continue to address together is ensuring the safety of our Nation's diplomats. We need assurance that funding is being used effectively to address the most urgent security needs.    Next, I want to mention an issue that I know is a priority for you, Middle East peace. Negotiating a peace deal requires trusted partners, and the recent actions by President Abbas at the International Criminal Court have jeopardized the trust that has been built over the years. We want to hear how you plan to respond to the Palestinians' move to join the ICC. And we question why the administration's budget request includes another $440 million for the West Bank and Gaza in light of these very troubling actions by the Palestinian leadership.    Finally, I want to mention an issue that is a priority for me, a foreign policy issue in our own backyard. The administration's budget request includes $1 billion for the Central American countries, more than double the amount provided last year.    Many members of this subcommittee understand the need for an increased investment in these countries to stop the flow of illegal immigration to the United States. I have, visited these countries and the U.S.-Mexico border several times and have seen this crisis firsthand. We need your help today to understand such a large investment and how it would change the situation on our border.    Our neighbor Mexico is on the front lines of combating these troubling patterns of immigration from Central America. We must do all we can to help Mexico strengthen its borders and turn away those traveling illegally from Central American countries. We must also support and use the capabilities of partners in the region, such as Colombia, to continue to develop and implement a comprehensive security strategy.    In closing, I want to thank you and the thousands of diplomats, development officers, and implementing partners for what you do every day to promote U.S. interests abroad. You have a very difficult job, and all of the members of this subcommittee recognize that.    We also know that the United States must lead in these troubling times. It is our responsibility to hold you to account for managing the funds this committee provides to address these challenges.    I will now turn to my good friend, the ranking member, Mrs. Lowey, for her opening remarks.                    Opening Statement by Mrs. Lowey    Ms. Granger. I will now yield to Chairman Rogers for his opening statement.                Opening Statement by Chairman Mr. Rogers    Ms. Granger. Secretary Kerry, please proceed with your opening remarks. Your full written statement, of course, will be placed in the record. We are going to have another set of votes fairly soon, so I would ask you to summarize your statement so we can try to get a full round of questions before those votes.    Secretary Kerry.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    I will start with this question. The administration wants countries in the Middle East to step up and play a greater role in the fight against ISIL, as we do. But as Jordan and Egypt and the Kurds are taking on a significant role, and are often successful, they are not getting the assistance they need.    The White House claims that there are robust security relationships with these countries, but I would argue the U.S. is risking our long-term strategic alliances. The Kurds and the Jordanians are very frustrated with the amount of time it takes to get military aid to them. I know you know that because they have argued that with you, and they have certainly called me.    And the President's policy on Egypt continues to hold equipment such as the F-16s that are paid for and are clearly needed in the fight against ISIL and other terrorists in the region. I wanted to ask you, why is the administration continuing to withhold equipment for Egypt that would help them combat ISIL and other threats?    Ms. Granger. We talked about this last year at the hearing, and I remember last year you were talking about these needed reforms and arrests of journalists and progress on, say, parliamentary elections. And those things have been done, literally----    Ms. Granger. Some.    Ms. Granger. Not all.    Ms. Granger. You may see it happening. I certainly don't.    And you know we have had numerous conversations. The staff has asked questions about this. The situation with the Kurds has gone on for months and months and months. And every time we ask, we hear, we are making some progress.    Ms. Granger. The Egyptians came back to me and said, we don't know what you want, we have no idea. Because we have urged them to play a part, and they certainly are. The King of Jordan, for goodness' sake, has put on his uniform and is flying the planes.    So I think that the slowness of the process is simply very, very disturbing. And I would like from you a weekly status on this very immediate threat. It gets worse and worse. And everyone that we hear talk, the generals that come and say, we can stop it now, but at some point we can't stop it.    Ms. Granger. I am going to stop you.    Ms. Granger. I know what you are going to say, and I know what you are saying. You know my position. I think you know the position of Members of the Congress. And so we will continue this as we go on, but I certainly want to have other people have the opportunity to ask questions.    Mrs. Lowey.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Granger. Short question.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Ms. Granger. Thank you. I am going to recess the hearing for members to vote. If you will return as quickly as possible.    Ms. Granger. We are going to come back. The hearing is now in recess.    Ms. Granger. The hearing will now come to order. I will now turn to Mr. Dent for his questions.    Ms. Granger. Thank you. Mr. Serrano; I am sorry. I am wrong.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Serrano.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    The Secretary has to leave here at a quarter till 5. That is 15 minutes. And we have two members that have not asked questions.    Mr. Fortenberry.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Stewart.    Ms. Granger. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. We have run out of time. Mrs. Lowey has an issue she would like to bring up.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Secretary, as we adjourn the meeting, I have a request. Last year the House established the Benghazi Select Committee. It is in all of our best interest for the select committee's work to be completed as soon as possible. So your assistance in ensuring sufficient resources are dedicated to respond quickly to the select committee's requests is appreciated.    Thank you again for your time today. This concludes today's hearing.    Ms. Granger. Members may submit any additional questions for the record.                                           Tuesday, March 17, 2015.                Opening Statement by Chairwoman Granger    Ms.  Granger. The Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs will come to order.    I want to welcome the Acting Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Ambassador Al Lenhardt.    Ambassador, we look forward to hearing your testimony and certainly with working with you.    USAID responds to some of the most challenging problems in the world, from tackling emergency situations, such as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the humanitarian crisis in Syria, to addressing long-term development needs in some of the poorest, most conflict-stricken places around the globe. I am proud of our men and women who serve overseas in our military and USAID missions, the Peace Corps, and our embassies around the world. I want to ensure that the United States continues to lead on the world stage.    Real leadership requires the willingness to review what is going well and what isn't. I believe there are many areas of USAID that could see improvement that I hope we can work together to address. My first concern is that there are many U.S. Government agencies involved in health, development, and disaster response activities overseas. I am concerned that responsibilities may not always be clear, that agencies may duplicate each others' efforts, and coordination may not occur as it should.    As you well know, as a former ambassador to Tanzania, an embassy that was attacked in the 1990s, desk space at U.S. embassies comes with a high price because of the security required. Overseas positions for all agencies should be carefully considered to ensure that the work gets done effectively and efficiently by the agency with the most appropriate skills to address the problems at hand. There is no room today certainly for replication of budgets.    Another challenge that former Administrator Shah tried to address, is with the Feed the Future Initiative, and I hope you will continue to do so with other programs as well.    In many countries USAID tries to do too much. The Agency needs to continue focusing on reducing the numbers of programs it manages and do those very well. You should terminate the programs that don't work or may be causing you to spread the Agency's people and resources too thin. I would love to work with you on some of those.    My next concern is that it is difficult to get access to USAID. There are many American businesses, faith-based organizations, and universities that have development ideas to bring to the table, and we consistently hear complaints that they can't find ways to partner with the Agency. So I would hope you would look at that.    Ambassador Lenhardt, with your military background and your time spent as a diplomat, you bring a great perspective to the Agency. I hope you can discuss some of the management challenges that are directly related to your budget and we can work together to solve them.    The budget request includes $22 billion that USAID manages entirely or partially. This includes a $269 million increase for USAID's operating expenses. It is, frankly, very unlikely that our subcommittee's allocation would allow us to address all the areas identified in the request, so we will have to work closely together to prioritize many competing demands in international development, health, and humanitarian programs.    I want to close by thanking you and the men and women of USAID as well as your implementing partners, who are committed to solving some of the most difficult global development issues around the world, often in very dangerous places. All of us on this subcommittee understand and appreciate that work.    I will now turn to my ranking member, Mrs. Lowey, for her opening remarks.                    Opening Statement by Mrs. Lowey    Ms.  Granger. Thank you.          Ms.  Granger. Ambassador Lenhardt, please proceed with your opening remarks. I would encourage you to summarize your remarks so we leave enough time for questions and answers. Your full written statement will be placed in the record. And we understand that votes are going to be called about 3:30, so we hope to have everyone be able to ask their questions. Thank you.    Ms.  Granger. Thank you so much.                Ms.  Granger. As you were talking about that, I remember when I first came on this subcommittee and we were getting ready to go and Mrs. Lowey was the chair. I received a call that was from someone named Bono who said ``don't ever forget you are saving lives.'' There is a difference, so thank you very much.    I will go into questions. I have one question. Ambassador Lenhardt, I know that you are aware of a recent press report that the State Department funded an organization that has been involved in trying to influence the upcoming elections in Israel. USAID was not involved in that. But the question is, how would you ensure that USAID wouldn't use U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund organizations trying to influence elections, including some of those of our closest allies?    Ms.  Granger. Thank you, very much.    Mrs. Lowey.    Ms.  Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Crenshaw.    Ms.  Granger. Thank you.    Ms.  Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Ruppersberger.    Ms.  Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Rooney.    Ms.  Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Serrano.    Ms.  Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Fortenberry.    Ms.  Granger. Long days.    Ms.  Granger. Thank you.    Ms. Lee.    Ms.  Granger. Mr. Dent.    Ms.  Granger. Before you answer that, could I say they have called votes. There are still 308 that haven't voted. We have two, Ms. Wasserman Schultz and Diaz-Balart, who haven't had a question.    Ms.  Granger. So we are going to try to do that.    Ms.  Granger. Thank you.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz.    Ms.  Granger. Could we go to Mr. Diaz-Balart, and then come back if we still have time to your second question?    Ms.  Granger. I think we only have----                                         Wednesday, March 18, 2015.                Opening Statement by Chairwoman Granger    Ms. Granger. The Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs will come to order.    I would like to welcome Secretary Lew before the subcommittee to discuss the fiscal year 2016 budget request for the Treasury Department's International Affairs Programs.    The funding under review today supports contributions to international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, global climate change programs, debt relief, and technical assistance programs.    The budget request totals $3.1 billion, a 28 percent increase above fiscal year 2015. This funding level reflects the Congressional Budget Office's higher scoring of the IMF proposal than that of the administration.    This is the third year that the administration has requested authority and funding for the IMF. In the past, there has not been sufficient congressional support for the IMF proposal. And, frankly, I don't expect much to change this year.    Turning to the World Bank and the regional development banks, I have continued to express concerns about multiyear funding commitments made to these institutions. The administration argues that these organizations give us more ``bang for the buck'', but I question whether these multilateral institutions are being held to the same standards as our bilateral programs.    The banks' lack of transparency in allocating funds and decision-making hurts their support in Congress. Increasingly, it seems the United States is one of the only voices demanding responsiveness and accountability.    I would like to hear from you today about the efforts these institutions are making to publicly track funding and provide independent evaluations of program effectiveness.    Last year the administration made a multi-billion-dollar pledge to the new Green Climate Fund. When you commit the United States to controversial programs that are unlikely to be fully funded by the Congress, the administration puts the credibility of the United States on the line. Mr. Secretary, I hope you can discuss this more with the subcommittee today.    Finally, while the Treasury Department's role in U.S. policy toward Cuba lies more in the jurisdiction of the Financial Services Subcommittee, this subcommittee is also closely following the administration's move to normalize relations with Cuba, and I have deep concerns.    Secretary Lew, thank you for being here today. We have many important topics to discuss.    I will now turn to my ranking member, Mrs. Lowey, for her opening statement.                    Opening Statement by Mrs. Lowey    Ms. Granger. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey.    I will now yield to Chairman Rogers for his opening statement.                  Opening Statement by Chairman Rogers    Ms. Granger. Secretary Lew, please proceed with your opening remarks. I would encourage you to summarize your remarks so we leave enough time for questions and answers. Your full written statement will be placed in the record.                   Opening Statement by Secretary Lew    Ms. Granger. Thank you very much.              Ms. Granger. In May of last year, Ukraine issued 1 billion dollars of new debt on the international capital markets, backed by the United States. It is my understanding that the proceeds are providing support for ongoing reforms and development in Ukraine.    The President's request for fiscal year 2015 includes another $1-billion loan guarantee, but the funding request for $275 million to subsidize that loan guarantee is not consistent with OMB's most recent analysis of the appropriated funds required.    Could you explain the funding needed and requested for a loan guarantee in fiscal year 2016.    Ms. Granger. I understand what you just said. I also have another concern, and that is when will the additional loan guarantee we authorized in December be obligated.    It has been 3 months now, I just returned from Ukraine, and time is of the essence. Can you explain when it will happen.    Ms. Granger. I met with her yesterday.    Ms. Granger. Good. I think everything we can do to help them will certainly be appropriate.    Mrs. Lowey.    Ms. Granger. Chairman Rogers.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Serrano.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Ms. Granger. That was good.    Mr. Crenshaw.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Ruppersberger.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Stewart.    Ms. Granger. Thank you. We will offer another round of questions.    I am going to ask a question first. In 1993, the NAFTA agreement included a side agreement to create the North American Development Bank, NADBank, to tackle environmental issues on the U.S./Mexico border. NADBank was originally focused on water and waste water problems, but the bank has now moved into renewable energy projects. The budget request includes new funding for the NADBank, and I understand that part of the increase is because NADBank's ability to borrow on the capital markets is limited because of a downgrade by Moody's and other credit-rating agencies.    First, I hope you can explain to Members why the NADBank was downgraded; second, how much of this downgrade was due to NADBank's shift to finance renewable energy projects; and finally, will the authorization language that is needed to recapitalize the NADBank require a change to the NAFTA treaty?    Ms. Granger. Will this require a change in NAFTA?    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mrs. Lowey.    Mr. Ruppersberger.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Serrano.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Fortenberry, you will have the last question.                                           Tuesday, March 24, 2015.                Opening Statement by Chairwoman Granger    Ms. Granger. The Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs will come to order.    I would like to welcome our witnesses to today's hearing: Roberta Jacobson, Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere; William Brownfield, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement; and Elizabeth Hogan, Acting Assistant Administrator for USAID for Latin America and the Caribbean.    Thank you all for being here.    Last summer, our country experienced a national security and humanitarian crisis of historic proportions as tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors were sent through criminal smuggling networks from Central America across Mexico into our southern border. Although the number of unaccompanied children has dropped since then, thousands more are expected to cross this year. And that is unacceptable.    At the Speaker's request, I led a working group to examine this issue and provide recommendations. I visited the Texas-Mexican border several times. I also led a delegation to Guatemala and Honduras to see where the children were coming from and why.    There are many reasons why so many families and children have made and continue to make this dangerous journey. Some of this can be explained by the administration's slow pace of deportations and insufficient focus on law enforcement at the border. The harsh conditions and lack of security in Central America also play a role. In addition, the lack of economic opportunity and high unemployment is causing people to look for other ways to survive.    The purpose of today's hearing is to discuss what the United States and other countries in the region can do to put an end to this illegal migration at its source. The United States has provided assistance to Central America for many years. We need to take a hard look at what has worked, what has not, and what changes need to be made going forward.    Last year's appropriations act increased assistance for Central America and also included support for programs to combat human trafficking and help countries repatriate and reintegrate their citizens. The administration's budget request includes one billion dollars for Central America, more than double the amount provided last year. The committee needs an explanation from our witnesses on how such a large investment will change the situation at our border.    While the United States has a role to play in helping Central America, we cannot and should not do this alone. Other countries in the region have a stake in Central America's failure or success. Our neighbor Mexico is at the front lines of combating illegal migration, and we must do all we can to help Mexico strengthen its borders.    In addition, we should also support and use the capabilities of partners in the region, such as Colombia. There are a number of lessons we can learn from Plan Colombia. Specifically, for lasting change to occur, we need a solid commitment from the partner countries themselves. These governments must be willing to make hard choices and address the needs of their own citizens.    I have met with the presidents of some of these countries and have already seen progress. For the first time, the Central American governments had come together to develop a joint plan to address shared problems in the region. Just as I believe the United States should assist those countries, so, too, should we hold the governments accountable for following through on their commitments.    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today on how we can best address these important issues.    And I would now like to turn to my friend, Ranking Member Lowey, for her opening remarks.                    Opening Statement by Mrs. Lowey    Ms. Granger. You are welcome.    Ms. Granger. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey.    I will now call on the witnesses to give their opening statements. I would encourage each of you to summarize your remarks so we leave enough time for questions and answers. Your full written statements will be placed in the record.    We will begin with Assistant Secretary Jacobson.                   Opening Statement by Ms. Jacobson    Ms. Granger. Thank you.            Ms. Granger. Assistant Secretary Brownfield, you are now recognized.               Opening Statement by Ambassador Brownfield    Ambassador Brownfield. Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman, Ranking Member Lowey, members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I am honored to appear with my old friends Roberta Jacobson and Beth Hogan.    We meet today to discuss the President's strategy for Central America, but we filter that discussion through our experience last summer, when tens of thousands of Central American migrants, many of them children, arrived at our southwest border. We learned lessons. The most important was that the solution to the migration crisis is not at our border--it is in Central America--and the root causes that drive the migration north.    As Assistant Secretary Jacobson just described, the President's strategy attacks those root causes with three prongs: prosperity, governance, and security. I work the security prong, and I look forward to working with Beth on the governance prong.    We do not start this exercise from scratch. Since 2009, my bureau has provided support and assistance, generously funded by the United States Congress through CARSI, the Central America Regional Security Initiative.    There are some who suggest that after 6 years there is little to show for the effort. I do not agree. Thanks to Operations Martillo and Anvil, drug smuggling by air through Honduras is down perhaps 50 percent since 2012. Maritime drug seizures, our best measure of drug flow, have fallen 40 percent in Costa Rica and 60 percent in Panama.    Seventy-two maritime drug smugglers have come to the United States to face justice. The homicide rate in Honduras has dropped more than 20 percent from 2011. And joint border law enforcement task forces now work along the borders between Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, as well as Panama and Colombia.    I do not apologize for CARSI, Madam Chairwoman. I am proud of it.    But if we had been completely successful, we would not be here today. I have been in this business more than 36 long years, and I have learned perhaps two lessons. First, it takes years to create drug crime and security-driven crises, and it will take years to resolve them. Second, no strategy succeeds unless it addresses the fundamental problems and provides adequate resources to do the job.    The President's strategy addresses the three core challenges for Central America today. The INL request for the 2016 budget is $205 million, 25 percent more than the amount generously appropriated by Congress for this year.    The subcommittee has a right to ask--in fact, the subcommittee has already asked--what more will you see for this 25 percent uptick.    First, much closer integration between INL and USAID programs in Central America. That is the point of the President's strategy. The Central America problem is not one-dimensional. It is security, governance, and prosperity.    Second, we plan to pilot a new programming approach that links USAID's community programming with INL's model police precincts. We call it the place-based approach. Jointly, we identify communities, age groups, security threats, root causes, and design specific programs to address them. Initial reports from Honduras on place-based programs are promising.    Third, we will expand those CARSI programs with a successful track record--specialized and vetted units, joint task forces, police training and reform, border security, youth and gang education, drug demand and rehabilitation centers.    Members of the subcommittee, we knew when we started CARSI together in 2009 that we were in this for the long haul. We knew that we would learn from programs that worked well and others that worked poorly. We knew that we would accomplish only as much as the regional governments' political will would support.    We have delivered some results. Central America is a better place today. The United States is a safer place due to those efforts. We obviously have more work to do. I look forward to working closely with this subcommittee to get it done.    Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and I look forward to your comments and questions.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.                Ms. Granger. Acting Assistant Administrator Hogan, you are now recognized.                     Opening Statement by Ms. Hogan    Ms. Granger. Thank you.                Ms. Granger. Since last summer, there have been a number of strategies. You talked about two, the first being the Alliance for Prosperity, for which the three Central American countries came together under Honduras' leadership, putting together a plan. Then, of course, the Vice President put forward a plan, his own strategy. But neither one of those plans have goals that are tied to funds to implement them.    Last year in our appropriations act, we required a strategy to target assistance to address the factors contributing to this problem, including goals, benchmarks, timelines, and a spend plan. That was due last week. So I would ask first, Secretary Jacobson, when we can expect that plan?    Ms. Granger. Right.    Ms. Granger. Before we approve funding, we will have to have that strategy, which needs to be very specific as to if and how the Central American Presidents' plan fits into that.    The other thing that is important to me in this is where we are right now with respect to the number of unaccompanied children, and what we went through last year. According to the Department of Homeland Security, over 68,000 unaccompanied children were apprehended in the United States last year, with three-quarters of that being from Central America, and most of the rest were from Mexico.    We, the task force, visited Central America, and the first question I asked was, do you want your children back? It was a very straightforward question, and the answer would make a difference in what we would do as the United States. Their answer was: Absolutely, we want our children back. But last year the United States only returned 2,000 children--68,000 apprehended, 2,000 returned.    So now the administration is asking for one billion dollars to address the causes, but I would ask to the witnesses: Is it possible to get this under control without changes to our own laws and policies that allow those children to be quickly returned to their countries and their families?    How do you take into account that although the children were coming from Central America, they were transitting through Mexico. We returned 2,000, but Mexico returned, I think, 18,000 minors from Central America last year.    So I would say, what are we doing right now, and how can you strengthen our border and also keep that commitment we made that we would return their children?    Ms. Granger. I was not criticizing Mexico in any way.    Ms. Granger. That was not my question to you.    Ms. Granger. That was not my question to you. My question was, should we have to change the laws? Because we sent back so few. Now these children will have been away from their families for a year and away from their countries, and I think that is something we need to address.    I will address one more thing, because you were talking about root cause us and how we resolve this. When I came to Congress, one of the first things I worked on was Plan Colombia. And Colombia is a very different place today, amazingly different. It was very difficult to do, but you have businesses that are flourishing and great tourism. But, first, they made it safe.    And as you are talking about employment and economic opportunities, companies are not going to move to a country that is one of the most violent and has the highest violence rate in the world.    I come, we all come with our different backgrounds. Mine was Fort Worth, Texas. It has been a very difficult time for Fort Worth--very high unemployment because we lost a lot of defense contracts. So, as our economy went down, our crime went up. The first thing we did was make it safe again so those businesses would flourish.    So, as we put these processes and these plans together, please don't give us a plan to fund for a billion dollars that says, first, we will offer opportunities to have business come. They are not going to do it unless it is safe.    Mrs. Lowey.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Serrano.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Fortenberry.    Ms. Granger. Ms. Lee.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Ms. Wasserman Schultz.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Ruppersberger.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    We will have a second round, and I have a question.    Ambassador Brownfield, last year, you were a witness at our hearing on transnational crime, and I asked a question about whether the State Department was using DNA forensic technology as part of your efforts to support law enforcement. At the time, the Department was looking into it. Since then, the Committee included $3 million for DNA forensic technology in Central America in the fiscal year 2015 Appropriations Act.    Would you tell us about the type of work you plan to do with these funds to strengthen law enforcement capacity in Central America through the use of DNA forensic technology?    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Serrano.                                         Wednesday, April 15, 2015.                Opening Statement by Chairwoman Granger    Ms. Granger. The Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs will come to order.    Ambassador Power, thank you for being here to testify. We have many important policy and budget issues to discuss with you today. I am sure you are ready for that.    First, I would like to address the recent announcement of a framework agreement for Iran's nuclear program. With each passing day, conflicting reports emerge about the parameters of the deal. I have serious concerns about promises that may have been made to lift sanctions on Iran, and I hope you can address this issue today.    The International Atomic Energy Agency has a critical role to play in implementing any agreement. Yet, we all know Iran's record of cooperating with the IAEA is not good. I hope you can help the committee understand why we should have confidence that Iran will live up to its commitments this time and allow IAEA the access required.    I am also deeply disappointed by the hostile actions taken by the Palestinian Authority to join international bodies over the last year. Their steps at the International Criminal Court have put U.S. assistance to the Palestinians in jeopardy.    I am also very concerned about recent statements from administration officials that suggest the United States is reevaluating its approach to the peace process and reports that the U.S. may support a U.N. Security Council resolution laying out conditions and establishing deadlines. The administration must send a clear message to the Palestinians that the only path to statehood is through a negotiated assessment with Israel.    Concerns also remain about the U.N. Human Rights Council. I fear that the Council's upcoming report on last year's hostilities in Gaza will unfairly criticize Israel's right to defend itself. There are Members of Congress who question why we should support the Council at all, and I welcome your comments on this issue.    Regarding budget issues, the request includes a significant increase for accounts that fund the United Nations and other international organizations, approximately 25 percent higher than last year. Like many increases in the President's request, this one is difficult for me to justify.    The United States is by far the largest contributor to the U.N., and more work needs to be done to ensure that the U.N. has its budget under control. For example, U.N. peacekeeping costs have skyrocketed. The administration should work with the U.N. to phase out peacekeeping missions when possible and lower the rate the United States pays for them.    Madam Ambassador, you have committed to reform the U.N. and, as you know, our appropriations bill contains strong transparency and accountability requirements. Some progress has been made, but many international organizations continue to fall short. After all of these years, there is simply no excuse for this. I look forward to your thoughts on all of these important issues.    In closing, I want to thank you and the American delegation in New York and around the world for the work you do to advance U.S. interests.    Ms. Granger. And now I will turn to Ranking Member Lowey for her opening remarks.                    Opening Statement by Mrs. Lowey    Ms. Granger. Ambassador Power, please proceed with your opening remarks. I would encourage you to summarize your remarks so we will have enough time for questions and answers. Your full written statement will be placed in the record. We expect votes around 3:20.                 Opening Statement by Ambassador Power    Ambassador Power. Thank you, Madam Chairman, Ranking Member Lowey, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. Thank you so much for the invitation to testify today. And thank you for the rigor that you all bring in ensuring that America's contributions to the United Nations are used to maximum effect in advancing our interests and our values in the world.    As this committee knows and as both of your opening statements testify to, we are living in a time of daunting and seemingly perpetual global crises.    In the year since I last testified before this committee, a deadly epidemic exploded in West Africa, threatening tens or even hundreds of thousands of lives; a monstrous terrorist group seized large parts of Syria and Iraq, broadcasting beheadings and mass executions on YouTube; and Russia trained, armed, and sent soldiers to fight alongside separatists in eastern Ukraine, among too many crises to count.    These are the kinds of threats for which the United Nations was created. Yet, they have exposed profound weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the international system.    We have seen a global health system led by the WHO that, despite multiple warnings from credible sources, including our CDC, was slow to respond to the Ebola epidemic's growing momentum. We have seen Russia and China through their cynical veto of an ICC referral resolution at the U.N. Security Council block a step toward holding accountable a regime that has tortured, starved, gassed, and barrel-bombed its own people.    Representing our Nation at the U.N., I have to confront these vulnerabilities every day. But the central point I want to make to this committee is that, even taking into account these weaknesses, America needs the United Nations to address today's global challenges.    The United States has the most powerful set of tools in history to advance our interests, and we will always lead on the world stage. But we are more effective when we ensure that others shoulder their fair share and when we marshal multilateral support to meet our objectives.    Let me quickly outline four ways we are doing that at the U.N. First, we are rallying multilateral coalitions to address transnational threats.    Consider Iran. In addition to working with Congress to put in place unprecedented U.S. sanctions on the Iranian Government, in 2010, the Obama administration galvanized the U.N. Security Council to authorize one of the toughest sanctions regimes in the history of the organization. This combination of unilateral and multilateral pressure was crucial to bringing Iran to the negotiating table and ultimately to helping reach a framework that effectively cuts off every pathway for the regime to develop a nuclear weapon.    It is not only on Iran where we have used the U.N. to catalyze action on issues where the international community has proven unable or unwilling to respond.    Last September, as people were dying outside of hospitals in West Africa that had no beds left to treat the exploding number of Ebola patients, we chaired the first ever emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on a global health issue, pressing countries to deploy doctors and nurses, build clinics and testing labs, and fill other gaps that ultimately helped bend the outbreak's exponentially rising curve.    Of course, America did not just rally others to step up. We led by example, deploying more than 3,500 U.S. civilian and military personnel to Liberia, where we helped bring the number of new infections down to zero last month.    Second, we are reforming U.N. Peacekeeping to meet the challenges of 21st century conflicts. There are more than 100,000 uniformed police and soldiers deployed in the U.N.'s 16 peacekeeping missions, a higher number than at any time in history. They have more complex responsibilities than ever before. And the United States has an abiding strategic interest in resolving the conflicts where peacekeepers serve, which can quickly cause regional instability and attract extremist groups, as we have seen in Mali.    Yet, while we have seen peacekeepers serve with bravery and professionalism in some of the world's most dangerous conflicts, as in the Force Intervention Brigade's success in neutralizing some of the rebel groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we have also seen chronic problems too often, including the failure to protect civilians.    We are working relentlessly to address these shortfalls. To give just one example, we are persuading more advanced militaries to step up and contribute soldiers and police to U.N. Peacekeeping. That was the aim of a summit that Vice President Biden convened at the U.N. last September, where countries like Columbia, Sweden, and Indonesia announced new troop commitments, and it is the message I took directly to European leaders last month when I made the case in Brussels that peacekeeping is a critical way for European militaries to do their fair share in protecting our common security interests. This coming September President Obama will convene another summit of world leaders to build on this momentum and help catalyze a new wave of commitments.    Third, we are fighting to end bias and discrimination within the U.N., an issue both of you have raised. Last year, in keeping with a commitment I made in my confirmation hearing, I told this committee, ``The United States will stand with Israel. We will defend it, and we will challenge every instance of unfair treatment throughout the United Nations.''    We have lived up to that commitment, from mounting a full-court diplomatic press to help secure Israel's permanent membership into two U.N. groups from which it had long and unjustly been excluded, to consistently and firmly opposing one-sided actions in international bodies. And we will continue to live up to that commitment.    In December, when a deeply unbalanced draft resolution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was hastily put before the Security Council, the United States successfully rallied a coalition to join us in voting against it, ensuring that the resolution failed to achieve the nine votes of Security Council members required for adoption.    Fourth, we are working to ensure that the U.N, lives up to its obligation to promote human rights and affirm human dignity, as we did by pressing for the Security Council to hold its first-ever meeting on the human rights situation in North Korea. We used that session to shine a light on the regime's widespread abuses and give a face to its victims, like the man who was reportedly chained to the back of a car and dragged for some 30 miles in loops around his village simply for trying to escape to China.    In closing, let me stress we take very seriously our duty to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. So when we request full support for the accounts that fund the U.N. and affiliated organizations, it is with confidence that we are doing everything within our power to make the U.N. more fiscally responsible, more accountable, and more nimble.    Since the 2008-2009 fiscal year, we have actually reduced the cost per peacekeeper by 18 percent, and we are constantly looking for ways to right-size missions in response to conditions on the ground, as we will do this year through drawdowns in Cote d'Ivoire, Haiti, and Liberia, among other missions.    When we mobilize the U.N. and its member states to tackle global threats, we are doing more than just advancing our interests. We are enabling protection on U.N. bases for more than 112,000 displaced people in South Sudan who fled after security forces went house to house killing people based on their ethnicity.    We are rallying the U.N. General Assembly to uphold the universal values that America holds dear, as when we convened and the U.N. General Assembly convened its first-ever meeting on anti-Semitism in January, where more than 50 countries condemned anti-Semitism's alarming rise and pledged to take steps to stop it.    And we are not only helping prevent a generation of children in West Africa from being wiped out by a deadly epidemic, but also making it safe for them to return to their classrooms, as happened just yesterday in Sierra Leone, where schools reopened for the first time in over 9 months.    These are the stakes. This is the reason we will continue to work tirelessly to make the U.N. more efficient and more effective, and this is why we are so grateful for this committee's support as well as for its efforts to hold the U.N. to the standards that America's security and the great crises of our time demand.    Thank you. And I look forward to your questions.                Ms. Granger. I will have the first question.    Madam Ambassador, one area of the reported nuclear deal with Iran that is troubling to me is the removal of all U.N. resolutions regarding Iran's nuclear program. The Department of State's fact sheet on the parameters of the agreement states all past U.N. Security Council resolutions on Iran nuclear issues will be lifted simultaneous with the completion by Iran of nuclear-related actions addressing all key concerns. The lifting of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iran's nuclear program strikes me as quite a concession.    I have questions such as: What is the rationale for the immediate removal of such resolution? Can you clarify the timing of the removal of sanctions? Exactly what obligations must Iran meet under the agreement? Does the promise to remove U.N. resolutions include the U.N. Security Council resolution that covers the sale and/or transfer of conventional arms and ballistic missile technology? If so, how can we credibly assure our allies in the region that their deep concerns about Iran's nuclear program, as well as Iran's aggression in the region, have not been dismissed?    Ambassador Power. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.    There is a lot there. So let me try to take a number of those issues in turn.    First, let me stress a point I made in my opening statement, which is how central the U.N. Security Council has been to reinforcing what this body and the Executive have done in putting pressure on Iran that brought them to the negotiating table.    I do want to distinguish that the sanctions definitely are responsible for the kind of economic pressure that Iran faces that has caused them to make a very large number of concessions that many would not have expected. However, those sanctions did not succeed, as you know, in dismantling Iran's nuclear program.    Indeed, before the Joint Plan of Action, the estimates on Iran's break-out time were 2 to 3 months. And we are looking at 19,000 centrifuges and so forth that will have to be now dialed back as part of this agreement.    So, again, the multilateral effects are very real and they are why we are in a position, we think, to peacefully and verifiably ensure that Iran's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.    With regard to your question, I think the most important point to stress is that Iran has to take a whole series of nuclear-related actions, actions at Iraq, action at Fordow, action at Natanz, actions, again, to greatly reduce the number of centrifuges down from 19,000 to some 6,000, the kilograms of enriched uranium, the quality of that uranium.    All of those steps have to be taken before anything is done in New York and before any additional sanctions relief is provided. And those steps will need to amount to us having confidence that Iran's break-out time has gone from the 2 to 3 months, where we are now, to more than a year. And that is, again, with those steps that have been outlined in the parameters document would bring about.    So that is going to take some time. The estimates range from 6 months to 1 year. But, again, there will not be relief on the nuclear-related sanctions until those steps have been taken.    Second, I think, if I may just underscore, that this relationship is--excuse me--this framework is not a framework predicated on trust. That is why, again, we have to await the completion of those steps before you would see Security Council resolutions.    What we would do in New York, if this went forward, is, yes, lift the prior resolutions. But we would, of course, need to put in place a mechanism for ensuring that many of the sanctions remained.    The conventional arms and the ballistic missile sanctions we believe should remain for some time. There will need, of course, to be the enshrinement in a Security Council mechanism of the nuclear-related commitments that Iran is taking on. And we are going to need to create some kind of procurement channel such that any acquisitions or purchases that Iran is contemplating making that might be dual use would have to get approved through this procurement channel.    So by no means is it the case that, willy-nilly, we look and see that a deal is signed and then the Security Council sanctions that have been so critical to bringing us to this place simply melt away. Quite the contrary. We are looking at a phased approach and, again, one that we think leaves us in a much stronger position to ensure Iran's--the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear weapons program.    And if I left out any part of your question, please----    Ms. Granger. I will come back to it.    Mrs. Lowey.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Ms. Granger. Ms. Lee.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Rooney.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Ruppersberger.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Dent.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mr. Serrano.    Ms. Granger. Mr. Stewart.    Ms. Granger. Ms. Wasserman Schultz.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    We are going to have another round of questions, but we are going to have to be shorter in our questions and shorter in our answers or I won't get around to everyone.    Ambassador Power. Will do.    Ms. Granger. I am going to ask first about the Palestinian Authority briefly.    As it is obvious that they are turning their attention away from direct negotiation, instead going to the U.N. and the ICC, how do their actions at the U.N. and the ICC affect U.S. financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority? I see another $440 million request for the Authority in the fiscal year 2016 budget request.    I also ask you in that same vein if you expect the Palestinians to file formal charges against Israel and the ICC. What are you doing to try to discourage this? And if it is true that the ICC has already begun preliminary investigation into Israel's activities, how is the U.S. opposing the ICC's involvement?    Ambassador Power. Thank you, Congresswoman. I will try to be very succinct. There were a number of questions there.    First, as you know, we did not believe that the Palestinians were eligible to become a party to the ICC. We have made clear privately, publicly, many, many times over that we oppose their decision to go to the ICC, that it would be counterproductive, further poison the atmosphere that we were trying to, as we were discussing earlier, improve and--and hopeful that the parties can improve so that the aspirations of the Palestinian people, you know, can be advanced, which is not something that this ICC track is going to secure for them. A two-state solution will secure that for them.    So on the funding question, we are reviewing our assistance. As you know, the Government of Israel has just made a decision to release some revenue, in part, because at its core, you know, much of the assistance, whether it is the assistance that goes through Israel or assistance that comes from this body, is assistance that we use in order to deepen the security partnership to counter violent extremism.    The last thing we want is, you know, for the Palestinian territories to be radicalized, for youth to not have a place to go, for people not to be paid. And we know who exploits those kinds of environments. So I think we are in close touch, and it is a, you know, day-to-day discussion about how we go forward on the assistance question.    Finally, on the ICC's own relationship to this issue, the prosecutor has announced that she is undertaking a preliminary examination. So it is prior to the investigation stage. There are a lot of questions that she will need to sort through.    Again, we believe that one of those questions should still center on the eligibility question, given that a two-state solution has not been secured between the two parties. And while we are not a party to the ICC, you know, we, again, engage both the Palestinians to deter them from taking any further action, and, of course, we engage the court, both ourselves and through state parties to the ICC, to try to make very clear what the consequences of moving forward would be for what, again, we should all be for, which is peace and security in the region between the two parties.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    Mrs. Lowey.    Ms. Granger. Thank you.    I will say before we go on that, in the past 5 weeks, I have been to Ukraine twice with bipartisan, very high-ranking delegations from Congress, and we sent a letter to the President. The President of the Ukraine made a very impassioned plea for weapons for them to defend themselves. They are very, very concerned about what is going on there.    Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Ms. Granger. Ms. Lee.    Ms. Granger. Thank you, Ambassador Power. Thank you again for your time today and for your service to the country.    This concludes today's hearing. Members may submit any additional questions for the record. The subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs stands adjourned.
