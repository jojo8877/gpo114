    Ms. Palmieri. Yes, sir, it is. Thank you.    Ms. Palmieri. No, that is our understanding. This is less than one percent of our exports, and we are proud to be a part of the team that has had seven record years of exports for agriculture. So we know that we are shipping product. It is not all going through our food aid programs at this point.    I just wanted to report that for Food for Progress Program for fiscal year 2015, we did have increased tonnage going out, and so we are mindful of the use of commodities when we can.    Thank you.    Ms. Palmieri. I am going to take that question if it is okay.    Ms. Palmieri. I can update you on that, yes, we are having ongoing conversations currently with USAID. We are drafting a new MOU agreement to define the roles and responsibilities. There are productive conversations currently.    We are hoping to have a report more fully reporting to you, this subcommittee.    Ms. Palmieri. Yes, any time now. I had hoped it would be here ahead of me, but it is not. So, yes, we are expecting the report to come through.    Ms. Palmieri. I will need to talk with our colleagues at USAID and get you a precise answer. I do not want to answer that incorrectly today.
