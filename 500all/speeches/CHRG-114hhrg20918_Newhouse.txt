    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here this morning.    Being from the state of Washington, I am somewhat reluctant to get engaged in this California water war. I am like Mr. Costa, it is easy to let it drive you crazy. But if it weren't so important to not only the economy, but also the food supply of our whole country, as well as how you solve, or how we help you solve, your water issues will greatly impact how we solve water issues in the Pacific Northwest as well. So, this is a big issue.    I heard from Mr. LaMalfa in his opening comments some frustration about contrary policy by different agencies in the basin, or in the state. I think I heard that there were competing biological opinions and some interest in connecting those or making them into one, if that is a possibility.    Mr. Azhderian, you also expressed some frustration associated with a lack of transparency and collaboration. From those of us from the outside looking in, these California water wars have been going on for a long time. There must be a better way. And I think maybe we have touched on some of those avenues of doing this better, the collaboration, the transparency, all looking toward a similar goal of increased water availability, returning fish populations, habitat, but also protecting our very important agricultural industry and fishing industry.    So what would a better model look like? All of you from different perspectives. I will start with you, Mr. Azhderian.    Mr. Newhouse. Real quickly, could I ask the fisherman, Mr. Borck, and I will go to our farmer as well. And then if there is time, hopefully from the agencies.    Mr. Newhouse. OK. I appreciate that.    Mr. Sutton.    Mr. Newhouse. And then, Mr. Murillo, if you could speak for the Federal Government, where can Congress help?    Mr. Newhouse. Well, it is not going to get any easier with California's population expected to double in the next 25 years or so.    Mr. Newhouse. Yes, so we have a problem that we have to solve.    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
