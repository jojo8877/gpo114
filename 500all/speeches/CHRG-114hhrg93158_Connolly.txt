    Mr. Connolly. I thank the chair. I am glad to have this panel and this hearing. I just want to say I probably am somewhat demure from some of my colleagues with respect to the necessity of continuing to provide economic development assistance to the Palestinian Authority.    But having said that, Congress did put conditions on that aid last year, and those conditions have to do with the whole question of the ICC. And I know the State Department is reviewing as we speak whether that provision is now triggered. So hopefully we can persuade the Palestinian Authority that unilateral action is not in its best interest, nor ours, and that as we move forward, it has to be in the context of a broader peace negotiation. And I would hope that at this hearing we could illuminate that issue and have more clarity as to what the U.S. policy should be moving forward.    With that, I yield back.    Mr. Connolly. I probably did.
