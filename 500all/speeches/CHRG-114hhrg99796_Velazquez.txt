    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Cordray, the CFPB's core mission is consumer protection, which may not seem linked to systemic risk. However, I don't think that is the case.    Can you elaborate on what role consumer financial protection plays in the stability of our economy and how your agencies work and help inform FSOC?    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.    Mr. Gruenberg, we have heard from opponents of the SIFI process that there is insufficient opportunity to engage with the Council after designation. Do SIFI-designated firms have opportunities to meet with FSOC staff to review their status?    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you. I yield back.
