    Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is truly a fascinating topic we're discussing, and it's obvious there's no very easy solution. I mean, we've heard it's a chronic disease, 10 percent are seeking treatment. I guess my question maybe for Ms. Hyde at SAMHSA is, you know, certainly with pregnant women that may have young kids at home, and inpatient treatment might be the preferred, and we just can't let perfect be the enemy of good, what other options are you looking at for people who can't get in, I mean, they're just not going to enter inpatient, so they may be part of the 90 percent not getting treatment at all? Some treatment better than no treatment, as frustrating as that might be? What are your comments to the young mother that's got kids at home and she's pregnant and she's dependent and she just can't go into an inpatient center? What do we do for that patient?    Mr. Collins. So, again, with pregnant women, and we're looking at other treatments, I guess, whether that's buprenorphine or methadone, are there studies that show whether that has an impact on the fetus and the baby?    Mr. Collins. Now, as you've counseled these women, what kind of reaction are you getting? Are they recognizing--and you would think the genuine concern they have for the baby. I mean, there's very much a complicated balancing act going on here. What kind of reactions are you getting from the women acknowledging the problem and wanting to treat it?    Mr. Collins. So are these women finding you on their own, or are their physicians guiding them to you?    Mr. Collins. Well, it's something this committee's very concerned with. And, again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing and for all of your testimony. I wish there was an easy solution. There just doesn't appear to be one. So this is going to have to be addressed on a lot of fronts. And with that, I yield back.
