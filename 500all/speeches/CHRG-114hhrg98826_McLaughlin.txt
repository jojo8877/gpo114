    Mr. McLaughlin. Chairman Issa, Ranking Member Johnson, Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me. My main point today is simple: regulations contribute to poverty. That may sound counterintuitive, perhaps because some people assume that the costs of regulations are limited to compliance costs, and that those costs are paid primarily by businesses. This belief is incorrect. There are at least two specific ways that the costs of regulation can actually be regressive, meaning that the costs are disproportionately borne by low-income households.    First, regulations have regressive effects by increasing the prices of basic necessities, such as electricity and housing, which typically are the big-ticket items on the budget of low-income households.    Second, some types of regulations are associated with higher levels of income inequality, because they make it too costly and too difficult for entrepreneurs from the lowest segments of the income distribution to start their own businesses.    On my first point, in contrast to the belief that businesses pay the cost of regulation, regulatory growth is in fact associated with increases in the prices of all goods for all consumers.    A recent study, which I have submitted for the record, found that a 10 percent increase in the quantity of Federal regulations is associated with a 0.7-perecent increase in prices. While 0.7 percent may sound small, consider that this same study found that regulations grew by 33.6 percent from 2000 to 2012. A simple linear calculation of the effect over time implies that 2.31 percent of price inflation was associated with Federal regulatory growth.    However, if you consider annual compounding, which would be appropriate given that this is a rate of growth, the total price inflation associated with regulation over that period is close to 9 percent; and I promise I will not mention annual compounding again. That percentage is the average across all households, but the price inflation associated with regulation is worse for low-income households because the big-ticket items in their budgets also happen to be heavily regulated. For example, electricity costs make up more than twice as much of the budgets of low-income households compared to high-income households. Because it is heavily regulated, the regulatory price inflation associated with the good is also relatively high.    My second point is that regulations can contribute to income inequality. In the study that I submitted for the record, a co-author and I examined a sample of 175 countries to learn more about the relationship between regulation and income inequality. We found that those countries with more stringent entry regulations tend to experience significantly higher levels of income inequality. The explanation for this is straightforward: when entrepreneurs cannot legally open a business because of the cost or difficulty of dealing with regulations, they may abandon the idea altogether.    Consider the longstanding reputation of America as the land of opportunity, where you can lift yourself up by your bootstraps with enough hard work. Indeed, entrepreneurship has historically been one of the best paths from rags to riches. If regulations are inhibiting this process, people with low incomes have fewer opportunities to rise up the income distribution.    In sum, there is mounting evidence, mounting empirical evidence, that regulations are contributing to poverty. First, they have regressive effects caused by increasing prices, particularly for those items that low-income households purchase most.    Second, regulations can contribute to income inequality by increasing the cost of starting a business. This makes it more difficult for entrepreneurs to start their climb up the income ladder.    Although these facts are surely disheartening, there is good news. Because regulations disproportionately harm low-income households, regulatory reform offers an opportunity to enact a policy that would effectively act like a tax refund, because it would reduce the price inflation associated with regulations.    However, unlike a one-time tax refund, the benefits from regulatory reform would repeat year after year. They would not increase the deficit, and they would be progressive in their nature. That is, they would accrue foremost to low-income households. The regulatory process in the United States leads to regulatory accumulation, the buildup of rules over time.    Federal regulatory code currently contains over 1 million individual regulatory restrictions. If you actually tried to read regulations as a full-time job, it would take you over 3 years to read the entire code: over 3 years.    The accumulation of regulation is both undesirable because of the unintended consequences associated with it, and avoidable. If this accumulation of regulation is harming not only the economy but especially low-income households, it is certainly time to consider ways that we can eliminate regulations that are obsolete, duplicative, ineffective, or otherwise undesirable. We can and should change the regulatory process to reduce the ways that Federal regulations are hurting, not helping, low-income households. Thank you for your attention.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------    **Note: Supplemental material submitted with this witness statement is not reprinted in this record but is on file with the Committee.

Yes, typically a regulatory impact analysis performed by a regulatory agency looks at a single proposed rule in isolation and that is not a bad thing. But it is also necessary to consider that rule as part of a system of rules. And to paraphrase, actually, Ranking Member Johnson, there are nuanced questions concerning the interplay of various forces here, and those should be considered. Complexity of the regulatory system can in itself be a negative force in our economy.    Mr. McLaughlin. A couple of thoughts on this. First, the benefits estimates that are typically referred to are coming out of agencies' estimates before they make regulations. They are not estimates after the fact. It would be wonderful if we could implement a system of measuring both costs and benefits after rules have had their effects and we understand whether they are actually working or not. That would be a good way, if there is inflating going on, to avoid that.    But second, I also think it is relevant to consider the incentives of anyone who is engaged in a measurement activity, whether it is agencies or someone else. If agencies have incentives to make their numbers appear one way or the other, then perhaps you want to have independent analysis or another analyst take a look as well to corroborate.
