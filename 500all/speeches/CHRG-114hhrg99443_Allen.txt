    Mr. Allen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Madam Secretary, and thanks for your call, by the way. I am sorry I did not get back to you.    I wanted to just comment on a couple of things. One is you mentioned you have lowered the taxpayer growth in Medicare. I need some background on that, because I am not seeing that, so if you could get that to me.    The other number that I am seeing is ``totally insured.'' I am not seeing that in my district. In fact, a very small percentage of my district is insured. In fact, doctors tell me at the emergency room that nothing has changed, many people are showing up without insurance as before.    Also, on your comment about you do not pay more for preexisting conditions, I met a lady yesterday that told me about her son and his condition, and she wanted to know why his premiums had gotten so high and his deductible was like $10,000. I said well, I will get an answer for you. I need you to get that to me.    Last but not least, the President signed into law, and I voted for, the Hyde Amendment, which was an attachment to the appropriations bill. How are you monitoring your funding of these various claims that no taxpayer funds are being used for abortions? How do you monitor that, and what are you doing to oversee that?    Mr. Allen. You are auditing these clinics?    Mr. Allen. Okay. Alright. The other thing, we have some States that are opting out of the Exchanges. I think Oregon and Kentucky is talking about getting out of the State Exchanges and going back to the Federal Exchange.    Do you want to explain why that is going on? I mean our governor was criticized because he did not opt to go into the State Exchange, because he knew eventually the Federal Government was not going to fund it any more. Of course, in Georgia, we are required to balance our budget. He did not think the funds would be there.    What is your take on this?    Mr. Allen. I yield back.
