    Mr. Issa. Oh, no. You were the one in the Cadillac driving by.    Mr. Issa. Does the gentleman pretend to know something about hair? Is there a level of expertise being asserted here in Halls of Congress?    Mr. Issa. Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman, and I will remember that.    Mr. Issa. The case we're making here today hopefully plays right into what you just said, that if we anticipate that there have been or measure that there have before overreaches under this Administration and anticipate under the next Administration, then wouldn't the gentleman agree that legislation that specifically empowers the House to be a more effective balancing act over executive overreach would be paramount right now before the great hair revolution begins?    Mr. Issa. Well, I look forward to working with the gentleman to pass that legislation under the current Administration so that all future Congresses will enjoy that protection against overreach that the gentleman agrees can occur and has occurred and that this special working group is all about.    Mr. Issa. I hope it is both an alarm and an auto shutdown capability.    Mr. Issa. Thank you.
