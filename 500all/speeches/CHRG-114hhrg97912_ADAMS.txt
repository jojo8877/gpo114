    Ms. ADAMS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you all for your testimony today.    You know, I have talked about this issue for a long time, where some poverty is pretty high in North Carolina. People are working hard every day, two and three jobs. Working hard is not enough if you don't make enough.    You know, according to Feeding America, the 12th District of North Carolina, which is the district I represent, ranks 9th in the Nation for food insecurity with a rate percent of over 26 percent. And I have serious concerns about efforts to block grants, SNAP program, and I am pleased that North Carolina is participating in the work support strategy initiatives to make applying for SNAP and other safety net programs more efficient, both for families that want to work and for State government.    Ms. Golden, can you elaborate on how the work supportive strategies initiatives helps families get back to work in North Carolina, and how it benefits families applying for SNAP while also saving the government money?    Ms. ADAMS. Thank you. As a follow-up, how is service deliveries designed to not be a hindrance to working families, and how is the program structured to encourage families to work without disproportionately losing benefits?    Ms. ADAMS. Great. Thank you very much.
