    Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Costa.    I will recognize myself now for 5 minutes.    I represent the State of Washington, and this is certainly a very big issue in our state as well. And I just want to thank you, Administrator Shea, as well as Mr. Harriger for being here, and all of our witnesses on the panel, especially our canine guest. Kind of brings a different kind of atmosphere. Maybe we should have canines here more often.    But I would say that the average American, myself included, probably takes for granted some of the remarkable things that are done to protect our food supply and our agricultural industry from pests and diseases, so I just want to recognize the great work that you do. I am a former director of our Department of Agriculture, and sometimes I felt like I was the Little Dutch Boy with my finger in the dyke, which is, I know, sometimes how you feel as well. There are a lot of things trying to get in, and a lot of effort that we have to put forth to prevent that.    Mr. Newhouse. I appreciate that. Thank you.    Another question for you is on the notice of intent APHIS issued to prepare an environmental impact statement for revising biotech regulations. This notice seems to pose, I would characterize it as, somewhat vague definitions on the scope of the new regulations. They may be potentially including things like seedless watermelon, or even methods used in organic production. And that seems like it could be a very significant revision. But on the same hand, the President's budget only included a one percent funding increase for biotechnology regulatory services. So does APHIS plan to complete its revisions under this Administration, and if so, does the one percent reflect the scope of the expected changes?    Mr. Newhouse. Yes.    Mr. Newhouse. Yes. Well, thank you, Mr. Shea.    And again, I appreciate all of our guests this morning, and thank you for your testimony on this important issue.    And I would recognize Mr. Vela.
