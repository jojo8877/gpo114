    Ms. ADAMS. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Ranking Member Velazquez, for holding these hearings on tax implications for small businesses. It is of critical concern.    Ms. Harned, you note that regulations are extremely onerous for businesses. How burdensome are regulations here in the U.S. compared to regulations in other countries, particularly those with similar economic structures?    Ms. ADAMS. Would other members of the panel like to respond?    Ms. ADAMS. Thank you, sir.    Ms. Harned, many businesses are worried about duplicative regulations at both the federal and state levels. Can you discuss the extent to which firms face duplicative regulations?    Ms. ADAMS. Thank you.    I have a concern about minority-owned businesses, and I wanted to ask if you had any thoughts on how red tape impacts minority-owned firms or disadvantaged businesses, and how the agencies can work with these firms specifically to provide technical assistance around compliance issues.    Ms. ADAMS. So what is the solution then?    Ms. ADAMS. Great. Thank you very much.
