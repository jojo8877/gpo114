    Mr. Zeldin. Well, thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and I want to echo Ron DeSantis' point, how grateful we are that you are holding this hearing. And I think it is important for our constituents to know exactly what the President's strategy is in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and Syria. A strategy which is questioning what is the realty on the ground overseas, not so much what is the rhetoric here at home to best serve one's domestic politics.    We want to know what the rules of engagement are. Are we giving flexibility to our local commanders so that they could adapt to changing circumstances? Who exactly are the forces on the ground? Who is in charge? What is their mission? What is their skill set? What's the long-term plan? What is the vision for where we want to be a year from now or 5 years from now? Whenever we send servicemembers into harm's way, it is important for them, their families, for our country to know that they are being sent with a strategy to win to keep them safe. I yield back.
