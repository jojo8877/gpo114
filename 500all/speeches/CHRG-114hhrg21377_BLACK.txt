    Mrs. BLACK. I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to sit in, although I am not a member of this subcommittee I have been in the past. I just really appreciate your service as has already been said.    Mr. O'Carroll, I know as has been said by my colleagues from Pennsylvania, there are probably other areas that you could have made a whole lot more money in, perhaps you would even have as much hair as on this picture in our notebook, but we really, really do appreciate you coming before us and helping us to make sure that our taxpayer dollars are used in the best way that we can. I know the constituents in my district really appreciate it when I can tell them that we are overseeing the money they give to the Federal Government.    And so I go to this question in response: a recent GAO report on Social Security Administration stated that IT modernization is a significant priority for the agency. In fact, the President's budget actually requested $300 million in mandatory funding to modernize the SSA's IT system.    Given that SSA has already spent well over $300 million on the disability case processing system, and is still not yet operational, how confident are you that the proposed $300 million will cover the entire modernization project as the budget claims?    Mrs. BLACK. And if you were to give a suggestion to this oversight committee, what one suggestion would you give that you would say to us; this is what we want you to be looking at and holding them accountable?    Mrs. BLACK. Thank you, and I yield back.
