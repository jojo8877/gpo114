    Dr. Fleming. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And I am glad to hear, it is very interesting to hear that really a debate that is going on right in front of our eyes, the panel, of where we go with our nuclear deterrence. And I do appreciate the fact that it seems there is a consensus that we maintain our nuclear triad, and I certainly agree with that. We want to make our potential adversaries the most complex problem possible. That is how deterrence works.    Dr. Payne, I have a question for you. How do long-range bombers factor into your call for greater adaptability and flexibility in our future nuclear posture? And could you explain why we need the new Long-Range Strike Bomber that will eventually replace portions of our current bomber force?    Dr. Fleming. Okay, thank you.    Mr. Colby and Dr. Murdock, can you give us a succinct and compelling case for why we need the Long-Range Strike Standoff weapon, the long-range bomber, which will replace our current air-launched cruise missile? Do you believe this is an important capability, and why or why not?    Dr. Fleming. Yes, Mr. Colby, do you have a----    Dr. Fleming. Sorry, Dr. Murdock, yes.    Dr. Fleming. I can't see your nameplate so I am not sure who is who up there. Thank you.    Dr. Fleming. And I would agree. I mean, it is not only saving money through dividends, but it is saving lives through wars not fought. So I thank you.    And I yield back.
