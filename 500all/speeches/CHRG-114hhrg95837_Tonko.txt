    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and welcome to the panelists. Thank you for bringing your intellect and your passion to the table. It is most helpful.    In October of last year, the Atlantic magazine published an article titled ``The New Heroin Epidemic,'' which looked at a number of challenges facing addicts in West Virginia. I would like to enter this article into the record, Mr. Chair.    Mr. Tonko. Thank you.    The article discusses the challenges faced by opiate addicts seeking treatment including lack of doctors, poor reimbursement rates by Medicaid, and long waiting lists for some that are seeking treatment. I would like to discuss these barriers with the panel and ask whether sufficient resources currently exist to get treatment to those who need it.    Dr. Maxwell, you have tremendous experience caring for patients in the State of West Virginia. Do those wishing to get help for opioid addiction have sufficient access to effective treatment programs, particularly those in rural areas where addiction specialists might be hard to find?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. That would be most helpful.    And Dr. Banta-Green, a similar question. What are the resource challenges facing those who wish to find effective treatment for addictions, and are there research challenges in your State of Washington or the surrounding States like Idaho and Oregon? What are you seeing out there as a person so deeply invested in this arena?    Mr. Tonko. So is it basically a function of the trained, talented, skilled set of people or is it a function of resources made available beyond reimbursement rate levels?    Mr. Tonko. Especially with it being a gateway to the addiction, heroin addiction.    I thank you very much. I see my time is exhausted, and I yield back, Mr. Chair.
