    Ms. RADEWAGEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Yes, I would like to welcome some of our future leaders of American Samoa. These students are here participating in the Close Up program.    I have a couple questions for you, Mr. Messinger.    Ms. RADEWAGEN. Okay.    Ms. RADEWAGEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.    Ms. RADEWAGEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Again, I want to welcome our students who traveled 10,000 miles to be here with us today. We are all very proud of them.    Mr. Messinger, I have a couple of questions for you. We hear one of the largest barriers for exporting is understanding and complying with foreign regulations. Can you explain how you keep up with all the changing foreign regulations, including technical barriers and changes in tariffs?    Ms. RADEWAGEN. Thank you.    To better assist with export coordination, what tools should policymakers strengthen or reexamine for inefficiencies to help small businesses' efforts to start or increase trading opportunities? Mr. Messinger?    Ms. RADEWAGEN. And lastly, this is your day today, Mr. Messinger, when you are looking to export to a new market, what is your biggest obstacle, either domestic or international?    Ms. RADEWAGEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
