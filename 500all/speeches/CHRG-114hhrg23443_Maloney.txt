    Mrs. Maloney. This is one of the most depressing hearings I have ever sat through. It is just terrible what we are hearing. And I think at the very least you can start a policy that you don't build any more buildings unless you have proof that they can operate them and maintain them. That is ridiculous that you have to build a building and then operate and maintain it for additional cost. That is insanity to continue doing that. I don't see why we don't immediately stop that process.    And Mr. Sopko's statement that he's trying to get a list of what works and what doesn't and can't even achieve that, I think Mr. Chairman or some of us should write a letter to support your efforts, and if they can't still give you that list, we should legislate it, put the force of law that they have got to give you this information. And it seems to be a lesson in mismanagement.    And my first question is to Mr. Brown from DOD. And I would like you to briefly explain the difference between a cost plus fixed fee and a firm fixed price contract. And I note an IG report of the Afghan Ministry of Defense, the Air Force Civil Engineers Center awarded a $48 million cost plus fixed fee contract to construct the building by 2010, and it ended up after 14 contract modifications, the cost was more than double at $107 million. Is that right, Mr. Brown? It is almost unbelievable.    Mrs. Maloney. And then you go back with a firm fixed price and they are able to complete it on time ahead of schedule for $47 million. So just from that one example, it looks like we should be going with a firm fixed price contract and stop the cost plus fixed fee. But your comments on it, please, Mr. Brown.    Mrs. Maloney. Yes, I read that so ----    Mrs. Maloney. Well, why don't we stop that policy right now?    I would like to ask Mr. Sopko, what do you think we should do now with these out-of-control costs?    Mrs. Maloney. Okay. My time is expired.
