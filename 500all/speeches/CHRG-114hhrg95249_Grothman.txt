    Mr. Grothman. OK. I think some of these questions may be a followup from what was asked before. They're really for Mr. Camus, but we'll go through them again.    Commissioner Koskinen testified that he had confirmed that Ms. Lerner's emails were unrecoverable. Have you had any findings so far regarding what the IRS did to confirm that information, that he would use the word that he had ``confirmed'' it?    Mr. Grothman. OK. So did they give you any idea as to why they would say it was confirmed, other than just wanting it to be confirmed?    Mr. Grothman. Yes, I know you did. But the question is, why would Commissioner Koskinen make that Statement? Do you, in your investigation, see any reason why he would have made that Statement?    Mr. Grothman. OK.    Commissioner Koskinen testified before Congress that the backup-tape emails were unrecoverable. OK, that's what he said. Do you know why he would've said that? Or would that have been an accurate Statement?    Mr. Grothman. OK. Did they give you any clue as to how hard he looked, or do you know why he would have made that Statement?    Mr. Grothman. OK. So you don't even know--based on your investigation, you did not unturn anything--or overturn anything that would indicate that they had made anything, any real investigation that you could determine.    Mr. Grothman. OK. Thanks.    I'll yield the rest of my time.
