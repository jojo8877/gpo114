    Mr. DesJarlais. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Milholland, did the IRS hire a new director of the Office of Personal Responsibility in the past year?    Mr. DesJarlais. Mr. Tribiano?    Mr. DesJarlais. Who was that?    Mr. DesJarlais. Mr. Whitlock. Okay. And that is basically the director of the IRS ethics department, correct?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. Did they review this individual's history with the Department?    Mr. DesJarlais. Do you know why the individual's record would not be reviewed prior to hiring someone for this position?    Mr. DesJarlais. Why they would not review his record before hiring someone to oversee the IRS' ethics department.    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. Mr. Milholland, did that ring any bells? Are you aware of Mr. Whitlock?    Mr. DesJarlais. No knowledge of him?    Mr. DesJarlais. That was not run by you, Mr. Killen?    Mr. DesJarlais. No. Okay. So the IRS hires a new director to head up their personal ethics program. And, Mr. Tribiano, are you aware that he has a history of illegally shredding documents?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. I have seen different reports. Mr. Milholland, would you be blown away if you learned that you hired an ethics director that had illegally shredded documents?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. So you have not reviewed the TIGTA audit of the OPR that was completed while the individual was destroying taxpayer records, or you have not read the investigation record, or the record destruction, or whistleblower retaliation?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay. I guess I am just kind of shocked that, you know, this is a person that the IRS hired to be the head of their Office of Personal Responsibility, and he has got this history, and no one on the panel today seems to know anything about him.    Mr. DesJarlais. Is this typical of how the IRS handles new hires?    Mr. DesJarlais. So when somebody gets in trouble, they transfer him around. Is that how it works?    Mr. DesJarlais. Okay.    Mr. DesJarlais. Yes.
