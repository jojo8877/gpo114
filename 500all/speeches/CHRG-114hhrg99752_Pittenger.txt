    Mr. Pittenger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank each of you for being here. I would like to follow up on Mr. Mulvaney's questioning, and get some clarity on the role of the MDBs as it relates to the reduction of poverty. Were they the primary factor? Were there other factors involved? Did the private sector play any role? Give me some additional information, Dr. Karlan and Dr. Ravillion.    Mr. Pittenger. As you look toward, I think you said 2030 and the elimination of poverty for 1 billion people, what role do the MDBs play? And what other factors are involved there?    Mr. Pittenger. When you look at risky places are you referring to countries that have an intense amount of corruption? What role does corruption play in terms of how assistance is given out?    Mr. Pittenger. Sure. Dr. Karlan, your research is it--regarding the poor, what have you learned or discovered about institutions like MDBs that has altered your thinking, and upended maybe some of the essential understandings that we have had about MDBs?    Mr. Pittenger. Are there blind spots that you discovered about MDBs that we didn't have before?    Mr. Pittenger. Blind spots.    Mr. Pittenger. Thank you. My time has expired.
