    Admiral Richardson. Sir, thank you very much for your kind words and thank you for the question. We do produce a report to Congress about the feasibility of using low-enriched uranium. I have a copy of that report here which I submitted in January of 2014. And with the current state of technology right now, if we were to substitute low-enriched uranium, it would only be even technically considered for an aircraft carrier application.    And, because of the reduced energy in the low-enriched uranium, with the current technology, we would introduce another refueling event in the life of that carrier. That refueling event would come at a cost of about a billion dollars and would remove that carrier from being at sea while it comes into the shipyard to do that refueling operation as well.    We have done some recent exploratory work, and, you know, the potential exists that we could develop an advanced fuel system that might increase uranium loading and make low-enriched uranium possible while still meeting, you know, some very rigorous performance requirements for naval reactors on nuclear-powered warships. By no means is success assured by that.    Admiral Richardson. All right.    Admiral Richardson. From a pure military standpoint, no, sir.
