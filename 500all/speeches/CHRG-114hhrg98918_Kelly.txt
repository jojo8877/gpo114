    Mr. Kelly. Ms. Kruse, the CFTC swap data reporting requirements are not fully aligned with the SEC's requirement for securities-based swap data. Differences exist as to who is obligated to report, reporting timelines, and what data is reportable. What is the impact of these discrepancies between the SEC and CFTC's swap data reporting standards?    Mr. Kelly. And if I mispronounce your name, I apologize. Ms. Collazo? If you or Mr. Gil, I noticed you were nodding during some of that. If you have comments that you would like to add, I'd just appreciate it.    Mr. Kelly. And I apologize, Mr. Gil. I wanted to give Mr. Rogers just a chance to respond, and I will come back to you if I have any time. What is the CFTC doing to harmonize the data reporting standards with the SEC, Mr. Rogers?    Mr. Kelly. And Mr. Gil, you have my remaining 30 seconds.    Mr. Kelly. Thank you, and Mr. Chairman, I yield back.    The Chairman. That is right on time. Ladies and gentlemen, Ranking Member Scott and myself, we would like to thank you for coming and testifying before the Committee today. Under the rules of the Committee, the record of today's hearing will remain open for 10 calendar days to receive additional materials and supplementary written responses from the witnesses to any questions posed by a Member. This Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit hearing is now adjourned. Thank you.
