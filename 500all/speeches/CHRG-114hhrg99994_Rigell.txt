    Mr. Rigell. That is quite an introduction, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.    Mr. Rigell. I appreciate that.                          Remarks--Mr. Rigell    Mr. Rigell. First, I am a student of management, and I have been so impressed by the House leadership and management on the support side since I have gotten here. And, so I appreciate the good work that you do for the American people.    Let me say that there is not a whole lot of common ground in this institution, unfortunately, but the comments that the ranking member made, I think that she has made a good point there. You know, I feel like in some ways at the House we have kind of flogged ourselves on the back of cutting our own budget, which I think is a principle of leadership by example I very much respect and try to integrate into my own life. In the administration there wasn't any commensurate sacrifice there. That troubled me.    But as I see the young people who work in our offices, and how they do struggle, and the distances some of them are driving to get away from the high cost of living here, that I think this needs to be looked at again, and it is part of maybe, ideally, a comprehensive fiscal solution.    But there was just one question, Mr. Chairman, I had, that I would like to direct to Ms. Haas, Office of the Clerk.    You had mentioned in your testimony that there are some challenges with the voting machines, the cards themselves, things like this. And, I had not experienced any trouble whatsoever. I am not saying they don't need attention, but what are you experiencing that causes you to want to address that?    Mr. Rigell. I see. I see.    Mr. Rigell. I see.    Mr. Rigell. I applaud that.    Mr. Chairman, my questions are quite simple today, and that is it. And, I thank you for the opportunity and yield back.
