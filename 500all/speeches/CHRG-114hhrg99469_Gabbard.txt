    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Aloha. Welcome.    Since 2008, the U.S. and India have signed more than $10 billion in defense contracts, and the Defense Trade and Technology Initiative has been a priority in these bilateral security relations. Especially now with Secretary Carter as our Secretary of Defense, I think this has continued to be a priority.    Can you speak to your assessment of how the DTTI is working and, if there are impediments, what are they and how can they be overcome?    Ms. Gabbard. Okay. Before you respond, I will just add to the question about these three foundational agreements that I hear from Admiral Harry Harris and others frequently about being so critical to enhancing U.S.-India partnerships and their hope that India will sign those foundational agreements. If you could add that to your response of where you think that is at and if they will sign?    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you.    Ms. Gabbard. Yes. Great. Thank you very much.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
