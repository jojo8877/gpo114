    Mr. Cramer. Thank you for yielding. Thank you to all three of you.    I guess I would just associate myself, as much as anything, with the chairman of the full committee and the chairman of the subcommittee and put a finer point, perhaps on the set top box rule. While I have all the same concerns they have, I have a special particular concern about its impact, the disproportionate impact it would have on smaller video providers, rural video providers, and a number of us are always looking out for the smaller, rural providers.    And then I would just add one other issue and that is that I continue to hear from especially my rural telephone cooperatives of call dropping issues. And if maybe after the hearing somebody could hook up with my staff, I would like to get the latest from you all. Because we just heard from Tyler Kilde of Griggs County, for example. They are having as many as five complaints a month and that still seems awfully high. And I yield back. Thank you.    Mr. Cramer. And I love Ray, too.    I, too, served as a public service commissioner. He was a legend then, too.
