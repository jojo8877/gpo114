    Mr. McNerney. Well, I thank the chairman. I thank the chairman for allowing me to sit in on this hearing.    Ms. Ramirez, as you know, my bill, H.R. 5239, the Protecting Consumers in Commerce Act of 2016, would lift the common carrier exemption from the FTC's jurisdiction. Lifting this exemption would have the effect of directing the FTC to prevent common carriers from engaging in unfair and deceptive practices against consumers.    Would you briefly explain what the common carrier exemption is and what it means?    Mr. McNerney. Well, what are some examples of the exemption harm? What are some examples of how the exemption harms consumers?    Mr. McNerney. What type of redress does the FTC provide to consumers?    Mr. McNerney. Well, how do the redress tools that the FTC has differ from those that FCC?    Mr. McNerney. And there has been cooperation between the two agencies?    Mr. McNerney. Very good.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. McNerney. Well, I thank the chairman.    And I apologize that I missed your testimony.    Professor Vladeck, in your testimony you mentioned that the FTC has long asked Congress to lift the common carrier exemption. What are the justifications for this prior to the FCC's Title II reclassification of broadband internet services common carrier?    Mr. McNerney. Well, if the common carrier exemption is not lifted, what are some of the abuses that we would be seeing?    Mr. McNerney. So, throttling, for example, do you think that was intentional? Do you think they intentionally misled?    Mr. McNerney. Right. Well, couldn't it have been the broadband limitations or some other technical limitations?    Mr. McNerney. Well, I think we agree that the FTC has the expertise in protecting consumer privacy. Would lifting the common carrier exemption lead to better privacy protections?    Mr. McNerney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
