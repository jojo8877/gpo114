    Ms. Clark. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all the panelists.    I have--I also have a sort of general question for all of you, but it's been a theme that's come up. Dr. Crabtree, you referred to it. This--we tend to talk about basic and applied research in two different buckets and, you know, really silo that, and I think it has an impact in not only how we look at science and the way the Hubs are working but also in other areas in the way we fund things and prioritize. What I'm hearing from your testimony--and we had a hearing last month where Dr. Whittaker also referenced that this is sort of a false dichotomy that we have put together, and I would love to hear in your experience in the Hubs how you see this and, you know, do you see any potential dangers in really looking at these as two very different siloed ways of looking at science and research?    Ms. Clark. And one of my concerns is that as we look at innovation as a pipeline, if we don't start using the model that you are using, you know, where are we going to be as we pull back? And I don't know if any of the other of you have concerns or want to comment on that. Dr. Atwater?    Ms. Clark. Great. Dr. King?    Ms. Clark. Great. Thank you.
