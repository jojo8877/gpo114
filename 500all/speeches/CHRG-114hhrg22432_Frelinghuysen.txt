    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Good morning. The committee will come to order. I thank all the members for being here, especially the big chairman, Mr. Rogers.    I am pleased to welcome the 25th Secretary of Defense, Ashton Carter. This is Dr. Carter's second appearance before the subcommittee as Secretary, although we know him well from his many years of service to our Nation.    We also welcome General Joe Dunford, a great marine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Dr. Michael McCord, Comptroller of the Department.    Mr. Secretary, Prime Minister Winston Churchill observed 70 years ago, and I quote: ``From what I have seen of our Russian friends and allies during the war, I am convinced that there is nothing they admire so much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect than for weakness, especially military weakness.''    Churchill was referring to the post-war leadership in Moscow, but the same can be said today. I fear that, as I examine this administration's budget request, they have to be breathing a sigh of relief. One year ago, in this same room, we were told by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs that last year's budget request represented the lower ragged edge of resources the Department needs to carry out its strategy. The budget request before us today is almost exactly the same amount as last year's, and yet this administration now claims to provide robust funding for your Department.    Mr. Secretary, lower ragged edge or robust funding? The security environment used by the Department to justify a shrinking Army and Marine Corps, a smaller Navy, an older Air Force does not exist. In fact, we face more serious threats, from more sources, than at any time since World War II. Russia occupies Crimea and continues to menace Ukraine, its neighbors, and our NATO partners. China is building whole islands in the South China Sea and militarizing them, yet this administration suggests cutting an already inadequate shipbuilding budget. Many of our gains in Afghanistan have been reversed, while the Taliban and now ISIS await our departure, and Iraq is barely better.    Iran's global terrorist network just received a massive transfusion of money and continues to challenge our interests and our allies in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and across the Middle East. Syria is a living hell on earth, devolving even further by the day with Russian and Iranian sponsorship, and we seem to be deconflicting our operations with both countries, hardly our allies.    ISIS has a major franchise in Libya, its base of operations in North Africa, 160 miles of Mediterranean coastline. Terrorism is like a cancer across the world, and this budget does not do enough to hold its spread.    Moreover, many of us on this committee are concerned that this budget mortgages future military capabilities to pay for today's urgent requirements.    Mr. Secretary, our Commander in Chief proclaimed in his State of the Union address we spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined, as if dollars and cents are the only yardstick by which we measure the effectiveness of our Armed Forces and the strength of our global leadership. Our adversaries measure our strength based on our military capability and our national will, and currently those adversaries and some of our allies question both. Members of our subcommittee hear this repeatedly from foreign leaders as we travel abroad and we meet them here at home, as they watch our foes continually test us without consequence.    Mr. Secretary, I also want to bring to your attention a concern that many share about the activities of the National Security Council. It has come to our attention repeatedly that the rules of engagement for our Special Forces and rules of engagement for our conventional forces are being micromanaged right out of the White House. I am sure you would agree that battlefield decisions should be left to military professionals.    In closing, I can assure you that a bipartisan majority in Congress stands ready to provide our Commander in Chief with the resources that our military needs to meet challenges from Russia and China, and defeat the Islamic State, Al Qaeda, and other lethal terrorist groups, with or without the strategy that the law requires. In fact, the 2016 NDAA required the administration to provide a strategy to counter violent extremists in Syria by last week. We are still waiting.    Now, having said that, I would like to turn the microphone over to my ranking member, Mr. Visclosky. Thank you.                    Opening Remarks of Mr. Visclosky    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Visclosky.    Chairman Rogers.                   Opening Remarks of Chairman Rogers    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And, indeed, you have our full support, and the remarkable men and women you represent, whether it is civilians or it is military, are the best of America. And we are so proud of all volunteers doing some remarkable things.    Mr. Secretary, the floor is yours. Thank you for being with us.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Your statement will be put in the record and so forth.                     Statement of Secretary Carter    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your remarks.    Chairman Dunford, General Dunford, thank you for being with us, and thank you for your remarkable career.                      Statement of General Dunford    General Dunford. Thank you. Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, Chairman Rogers, distinguished members of the committee, good morning, and thank you for the opportunity to join Secretary Carter and Secretary McCord in appearing before you. I am honored to represent the extraordinary men and women of the Joint Force. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and civil servants remain our single most important competitive advantage.    Thanks to your support, the United States military is the most capable fighting force in the world. With your continued support, the Joint Force will continue to adapt, fight, and win in current operations, while simultaneously innovating and investing to meet future challenges.    I don't believe we ought to ever send Americans into a fair fight. Rather, we must maintain a Joint Force that has the capability and credibility to assure our allies and partners, deter aggression, and overmatch any potential adversary. This requires us to continually improve our joint warfighting capabilities, restore full spectrum readiness, and develop the leaders who will serve as the foundation for the future.    The United States is now confronted with challenges from both traditional state actors and nonstate actors. The Department has identified five strategic challenges, which Secretary Carter has already addressed.    Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea continue to invest in military capabilities that reduce our competitive advantage. They are also advancing their interests through competition with a military dimension that falls short of traditional armed conflict and the threshold for a traditional military response. Examples include Russian action in the Ukraine, Chinese activities in the South China Sea, and Iran's malign activities across the Middle East.    At the same time, nonstate actors, such as ISIL and Al Qaeda, pose a threat to the homeland, the American people, our partners, and our allies. Given the opportunity, such extremist groups would fundamentally change our way of life.    As we contend with the Department's five strategic challenges, we recognize that successful execution of our defense strategy requires that we maintain credible nuclear and conventional capabilities. Our strategic nuclear deterrent remains effective, but it is aging and requires modernization. Therefore, we are prioritizing investments needed for a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent. We are also making investments to maintain a competitive advantage in our conventional capabilities. And we must further capabilities in the vital and increasingly contested domains of cyber and space.    As the Joint Force acts to mitigate and respond to challenges, we do so in the context of a fiscal environment that has hampered our ability to plan and allocate resources most effectively. Despite partial relief by Congress from sequester-level funding, the Department has absorbed $800 billion in cuts and faces an additional $100 billion of sequestration-induced risk through fiscal year 2021. Absorbing significant cuts over the past 5 years has resulted in our underinvesting in critical capabilities, and unless we reverse sequestration, we will be unable to execute the current defense strategy.    The fiscal year 2017 budget begins to address the most critical investments required to maintain our competitive advantage. To the extent possible, within the resources provided by the 2015 Bipartisan Budget Act, it addresses the Department's five challenges. It does so by balancing three major areas: investment in high end capabilities, the capability and capacity to meet current operational demands, and the need to rebuild readiness after an extended period of war.    In the years ahead, we will need adequate funding levels and predictability to fully recover from over a decade of war and delayed modernization. A bow wave of procurement requirements in the future include the Ohio-class submarine replacement, continued cyber and space investments, and the Long Range Strike Bomber. It will also be several years before we fully restore full spectrum readiness across the services and replenish our stocks of critical precision munitions.    In summary, I am satisfied that the fiscal year 2017 budget puts us on the right trajectory, but it will take your continued support to ensure the Joint Force has the depth, flexibility, readiness, and responsiveness that ensures any future fight is not fair.    Once again, thank you for the opportunity to be before you this morning, and I look forward to your questions.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, General Dunford.    Let me associate myself with the remarks of Chairman Rogers' concern about prisoners being released from Guantanamo that go back to the fight. I mean, that is disturbing. I think it makes me quite angry.    In light of the President's intention to visit Cuba, there has been some speculation that there might be some announcement that would relate to the future of the Naval station at Guantanamo. Can you assure us that there are no plans for any change of our operations and historic role there?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yes, the Naval base. There has been some speculation that they might----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Absolutely. We have less assets in the region than we have ever had.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Respectfully, my question had to do with the future of the Naval station.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. There are no plans for----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Some sort of an announcement that would change----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Our historic role there?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Let me focus a little bit on the Middle East. I think the committee is going to be taking a look at, and I know Mr. Visclosky and I worked very closely on what is called the overseas contingency operations account, which historically is aimed at the focus on the war on terrorism. We did a pretty good job of vetting in our last bill all aspects of that account.    Can you review for the committee very briefly--I see at the top of the funding responsibility the issue of force protection. We still obviously have troops in the region. Can you review for the committee very briefly the issue of force protection, our continued, and it is, may I say, a rather expensive investment, in the Afghan Security Forces Fund, their capabilities? Even after all these years of supporting them, there are some questions as to how capable they are.    And two areas that have been mired in some, I won't say controversy, speculation, Iraq train and equip, Syria train and equip.    Can you briefly go through the list with our committee as to why these are your particular focuses? It is not that they aren't ours, but in reality, could you briefly go through that?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Indeed he has.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, to some extent part of what we are doing in Afghanistan is a perpetual, apparently, train and equip.    So, General Dunford, and then I am going to go to Mr. Visclosky.    General Dunford. Chairman, if I could start with Afghanistan, where you finished. To put it in some kind of perspective for the committee, when I arrived in Afghanistan in February of 2013, so about 3 years ago, we had over 100,000 U.S. forces on the ground that were fundamentally responsible for security in Afghanistan. Today, we have 8,800 Americans on the ground. And in the interim period, the Afghan Security Forces have assumed responsibility for security in Afghanistan, they have conducted two elections, and gone through a very difficult and politically turbulent period.    So, quite honestly, we have a lot of work to do, and particularly in the area of the aviation enterprise, special operations, intelligence, and so forth. But if you put in perspective where we have come from the last three years and you put in perspective the current investment versus where we were three years ago, but more importantly, if you put in perspective our national interests in Afghanistan, which are to maintain an effective counterterrorism platform and partner in that part of the world, from which we face a still significant threat, my assessment is that we are moving in the right direction, certainly not as quickly as we want to.    Let me assure the committee on force protection, we have very specific standards. We work hard in the Department to do that. I think you know when Secretary Carter was the deputy and we moved forward on the MRAP program, that was evidence of the commitment that we have to our people. And today those standards and the lessons learned over the past ten years have been incorporated and, frankly, reflected in the investment that we make in taking care of our people.    And very quickly on the Syria and Iraq----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yeah. I mean, there has been, obviously, a lot in open sources about the lack of success in some of those areas. So maybe you can talk a little bit about that.    General Dunford. Lack of success in force protection?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. No, in train and equip.    General Dunford. Oh, in train and equip.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We have got a lot of people on the payroll, we are training a lot of people.    General Dunford. Chairman, over the last----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We want to make sure that those tax dollars are well spent.    General Dunford. First of all, the endeavors in Iraq and Syria, relatively speaking, if you put it in perspective from some of the things we have done in the past, is still relatively new. We have trained over 15,000 in Iraq, and the evidence of their performance was recently demonstrated in Ramadi and is currently demonstrated in Anbar Province.    And so where we were four months ago, I would tell you, four months ago we did not have the momentum in the campaign in Iraq. Today, I can tell you with authority that we do have the momentum and the Iraqi security forces have proven to be capable in the Anbar Province and are now organizing for operations up in the north.    We have trained 2,500 Peshmerga. They also have been extraordinarily successful in cutting the lines of communication between Iraq and Syria, and they will also be very important as we conduct operations in Mosul.    In Syria itself, we had a slow start, but right now, as Secretary Carter outlined, the partners that we have on the ground that are being supported by U.S. funding, the ones that just recently took Shadadi, are going down to now isolate soon the caliphate, the location of the caliphate in Raqqa. And, again, they have also been successful in cutting the lines of communication between Iraq and Syria.    So from my perspective, a lot of work left to be done, but the enemy is under great pressure. We have significantly reduced their freedom of movement. We have begun to virtually and physically isolate them in their major areas of concentration, and we are doing that by, with, and through the Iraqi and Syrian partners that we have trained over the past year.    So my assessment is that, again, much work to be done, but the trajectory is in the right direction.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, we will be watching those programs very carefully. And thank you for your assessment.    Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Chairman Rogers, and then Mrs. Lowey has joined us.    Chairman Rogers.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mrs. Lowey and then Ms. Granger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. General, briefly, because I know Ms. Granger would like to have----    General Dunford. Congresswoman, I will be very quick. First, with regard to the primary risk, and I would echo the Secretary, protecting our own warfighting capability is critical. But as much as you focus on the risk, every time we talk about risk in cyber, we ought to talk about opportunity as well, and we do have opportunities.    And so to your second question, about investment, the investments that we are making are across the range of our primary missions, one, to defend our own network, to support the defense of our Nation, as well as take advantage of offensive capabilities, to take the fight to the enemy. And the Secretary alluded to what we are currently attempting to do against ISIL, which we, obviously, wouldn't talk details in this particular venue, but the investments we are making.    The Secretary also talked about the Cyber Mission Force. So over the last few years, we did build those 133 teams. Our investments this year are focused on providing them with the tools and, frankly, the training facilities, which are unique in cyber world, but those are probably two of the other areas that I would highlight that we are trying to do, again, to enhance the effectiveness of the capabilities we have.    We will grow capacity over time, but this year's budget is focused on enhancing the capability of the cyber force that we have been building over the last few years.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mrs. Lowey.    Ms. Granger and then Mr. Israel.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. Granger.    Mr. Israel, then Judge Carter.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Judge Carter and then Mr. Ruppersberger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Judge Carter. It is a critical issue.    Mr. Ruppersberger, then Mr. Crenshaw.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Very briefly.    General Dunford. Congressman, very quickly. The Secretary mentioned exercises, and you asked the question specifically about were we to posture forces on the border, would that make a difference.    I would just say that what the European Reassurance Initiative does in terms of increasing exercises is two things. One is it helps us develop interoperability with our NATO partners. So that is important.    But the exercises that General Breedlove designs are designed to send a clear and unmistakable message of our commitment to Europe as well, our commitment to Article 5 of the NATO alliance, and as importantly, a clear demonstration to Russia that if Russia faces NATO, they face the full weight of the military capability of 28 nations, the full economy of 28 nations, and the full political will of 28 nations.    And, quite frankly, if you put all that together, that is a pretty overwhelming challenge for the Russians. And our exercises are designed to make sure one part of that is clear, that we can bring the full weight of the military capability of 28 nations to bear in the event of a contingency.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay. Thank you. Non-NATO ally support for Ukraine would be appreciated, I know, by the Ukrainians. They are still waiting.    Mr. Crenshaw and then Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Ms. McCollum and then Mr. Graves, the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We respect your decision.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I agree with you. I agree with the General's statement as well.    Mr. Graves and then Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, both of you, for your--everybody, for their patience.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Graves.    Ms. Kaptur and then Mr. Calvert.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Let me commend Ms. Kaptur for her persistence on this issue. And while you are aiming it to Russian propaganda, we might come up with a game plan for ISIS and the Islamic State as well.    Mr. Calvert, and Mr. Ryan after.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Mr. Ryan and then Mr. Womack.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. See if you can do it.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you very much.    The committee, of course, would like to commend the Department for the good work they did addressing the Ebola. I mean, your command and control of that was very important moving towards its eradication.    Mr. Womack.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you for your patience.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We thank you, and we thank you for your service. And you didn't put a plug in, but others have referred to the enormous contribution of our National Guard, of which you were part of for many, many years.    There is a lot of keen interest, I know we are past high noon, but we are going to labor on. And let me know if there is any ill ease at the front table.    I would like to talk a little bit about the whole issue of deconfliction with Russians and others in the Middle East. Can you comment on that? There is a lot of open source information there. In Iraq, we are cheek by jowl with elements of the Quds Force. To some extent we see Russian superiority in major portions over Syria.    Can you talk a little bit about what we are doing? There is a report in The Washington Post that we have been letting the Russians know where certain operations are occurring. Can we talk a little bit about that in this session here?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. In Iraq, I mean, to some extent the Quds Force have been able to unite a disparate group of Shiite militias and have been enormously successful in terms of influencing the course of action there. I just wonder do you have any degree of discomfort, and what is your feeling about what is happening there?    General Dunford. Yeah. Chairman, thanks. In Iraq, there are really two issues. You know, you talked about us being collocated with forces. I would tell you from a recent trip, I am satisfied. We have a very aggressive counterintelligence program in Iraq to make sure the force protection of our men and women is taken care of. So that is a piece of, I think, what you alluded to.    With regard to the provisional military forces that happen to be backed by Iran, the one thing I am encouraged by is the Iraqi Government, particularly in operations like Ramadi, they recognize that our support was conditioned on not having those Iranian-backed forces in and around that area, and so they weren't participating in Ramadi.    I also know that there is a great deal of energy being applied to talk about how to integrate those forces into legitimate Iraqi Security Forces. And we are not at any time providing support for any forces that aren't actually legitimate, read part of the Iraqi Government in Baghdad and under Prime Minister Abadi's control and responsibility.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We are interested in, and of course all of us are interested here in the issue of force protection. And just because at this point in time people that are, should we say, cheek by jowl with us are, quote, leaving us alone, one has to assume that they, themselves, are doing what we are doing.    General Dunford. Chairman, I can tell you, just to make sure it is clear, we are concerned about that, we are watching that very closely. And I wouldn't suggest to you for a minute that we are complacent about it, and I know our commanders on the ground aren't complacent about it either. And we have a significant amount of resources dedicated to make sure that we can recognize the changes and take appropriate action in anticipation of those changes.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. It is good to have that public reassurance.    On the issue of rules of engagement, one of the benefits of congressional travel is that we often separate ourselves from general officers to talk with the men and women who do remarkable things. And I followed a little bit of the lead of my predecessor getting out to Bethesda, Walter Reed, and from time to time I run into situations where remarkable people who have done courageous things have been injured. And it bothers me when I hear that they didn't get the air support that they needed.    As you have pointed out, maybe the Afghans are ready for primetime, but I do hear more than anecdotal information that some of those forces don't fight at night, and as a result some of our men have been put in compromising positions.    And it sort of hinges on what, in my introductory remarks, which are not political, is that there is a feeling out there, and I think this is shared by a lot of Members of Congress, that there are somehow forces of higher up, and I understand the chain of command, that people have to check with a variety of different people before they, shall we say, look after the mission that they are involved in.    Could you comment a little bit about that and give, again, a level of reassurance here? To think that somebody would be sort of checking on you and the remarkable people who are in positions of command and second-guessing you, assure me that that is not happening.    General Dunford. Chairman, I can. Let me try to explain it. First of all, I wouldn't understate the concerns of the folks that you have talked to at Bethesda, Walter Reed, or talked to in the field. I have talked to them too, and sometimes they have confusion, they have questions. And believe it or not, even though I am a general, they bring it up to me as well. And that is the one nice thing about our force today, is they don't hesitate to unload on you. If you make yourself available for questions, you have got to be prepared to answer them, because they are going to ask them.    But I would distinguish--you know, rules of engagement kind of has become a catchall phrase for a whole wide range of activities that take place on the battlefield. I can assure you of you this. When it comes to the right of self-protection, there is nothing that limits a soldier, sailor, airman, or marine from taking appropriate action if they are threatened. There is no question about that. That is the fundamentals of rules of engagement.    What you are really referring to, though, is when, where, and how we employ combined arms on the battlefield. And so I would tell you there are times when those decisions are made at a more senior level, and, frankly, I made them at a senior level on occasion, because there are strategic implications sometimes with regard to civilian casualties and so forth.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Collateral damage.    General Dunford. Collateral damage. And so that sometimes has to be managed.    So we have various levels of authorities that are associated with the numbers of civilian casualties and the amount of collateral damage that may take place in a certain operation, and that is sometimes elevated to the general officer level.    And my experience is that, again, when it comes to soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines taking action that involves their right of force protection, they can crush a handset, so to speak, and call in combined arms and do what must be done.    When it comes to conducting a deliberate strike that may have strategic implications, we have, we do, and we will make those decisions at a level where risk can be managed appropriately to make sure that what appears to be tactical actions with strategic consequences, the decisionmaking is being made at the right level.    In my case, it was managing a very difficult relationship with the Government of Afghanistan. In some cases, our very presence and ability to conduct counterterrorism operations was being managed as a result of these strikes.    And so from the troops' eyes, I don't understate for a second their concerns, and I try to explain to them, just like I have tried to explain to you, look, it isn't we don't trust you; it is you can't necessarily see--everyone looks through a soda straw in combat, and everybody's soda straw is slightly different. And, frankly, when you sit there as a commander, your soda straw is a little wider than a squad leader or a platoon commander.    And, again, when it comes to them doing what needs to be done to take care of themselves or their unit, it is completely decentralized. When it comes to manage broader strategic relationships, yes, sometimes we make decisions at a level that the troops, the lieutenants, the captains would prefer to make those decisions themselves. And those of us that have become more senior feel like sometimes we ought to make those decisions, and there is a balance.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I am glad to hear it, because I do think as our footprint shrinks and there is that certain inevitability, that force protection, every soldier and whoever is representing our government deserves that assurance. And I just want to make sure that you have made it quite clear that that is the case.    Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Womack.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, thank you, Mr. Womack.    And I know the two gentlemen that have done most of the speaking today also rely on Secretary Michael McCord.    And while you didn't say anything, may I commend you and thank you for the close working relationship you have had with our staff and other committee members. There has never been a time when we have requested information that we haven't gotten the facts that we needed to do the job.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Please do.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You could be sure we take a look at all of the reprograms that you send----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . And ask for a full justification.    Yes, Mr. Visclosky.                                            Tuesday, March 1, 2016.              Opening Statement of Chairman Frelinghuysen    Mr. Frelinghuysen. The committee will come to order, everybody can take their seats, please. Good morning, everybody, the committee will come to order. This morning, the subcommittee continues a series of open defense posture and budget hearings with our military services, our combatant commands, and other major components of our Armed Forces. Today we focus on the fiscal year 2017 budget request, and the posture of the Navy and our Marine Corps.    Joining us this morning is Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, who will be testifying before this committee for the final time. I understand that Secretary Mabus is the longest-serving Secretary since World War I. I stand ready to be corrected, but it is a long time in grade, and we thank you for your very honorable service, not only to your home State, but to the Nation and to the Navy and the Marine Corps.    We also welcome, for the first time, Admiral John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations; and General Robert Neller, the 37th Commandant of the Marine Corps. On all of our behalves, we thank you for the remarkable job you do, and the men and women who you support and lead across the Nation and across the world. We are enormously proud of all of you and your leadership responsibilities.    In this time of rapidly expanding threats to our national security, our goal in these hearings, and in our fiscal year 2017 bill is to make sure our sailors and Marines and their families have everything they need. Every day brings another report regarding China's attempt to assert itself in the Western Pacific. They are building ships, submarines, underwater submarine pens, their naval militia is increasing, and they are designing cutting-edge weapons at an alarming rate. All of these things, quite honestly, simultaneously.    In the South China seas, they construct runways, air defense radar systems, and missile batteries on some of these disputed islands. They are bent on denying us access to airspace and challenge us, literally, at every turn. Their actions test our rules of engagement on a regular basis.    And then there is the regime in North Korea, which continues to illegally launch satellites and test missiles and nuclear systems. These provocative actions taken by North Korea undermine global security. Likewise, Iran is building naval capacity, its sophisticated antiship missiles to menace our forces in the Persian Gulf.    At the same time, a newly-aggressive Russia expands and modernizes its surface and submarine forces. These fleets are now more active in the Atlantic--we have heard a lot about that in this committee--and in the Mediterranean than any time since World War II. They are also expanding a naval base to allow new ballistic missile submarines in the Northern Pacific.    With all of these current and emerging threats, and a new pivot to Europe, we still have yet to fully implement our Pacific strategy. While such a pivot surely requires a greater emphasis on the Navy and Marine Corps, we continue to see budget requests that only marginally provide for an increased naval presence in the Pacific.    As was true last year, all of us remain concerned with the core Navy, ships and shipbuilding, and the shipbuilding industrial base. And after much talk of a 313-ship Navy, today the Navy has 272 deployable ships. For fiscal year 2017, your goal is to have 287 deployable ships. I continue to ask whether this is enough. Are we building enough ships and submarines to decisively defend against and deter our enemies in all corners of the globe, including the Arctic? You have heard me say this before: When it comes to ships, numbers matter. Yes, quantity has a quality all of its own.    In addition to the quantity of ships, all of us are concerned with the mix of ships, submarines, surface combatants, amphibs, support ships, and how they are operated and maintained. The logistics tail is important, as is what the tyranny of distance in the Pacific does to their lifespan.    In this area of budget constraints, we need to make sure that we are making every dollar count by investing in the correct ships, in the correct numbers, at the correct time. We also need to ensure that we are investing in the right weapon systems and advanced technology for the immediate threats we face, not just future conflicts. The strategy of playing catchup will only encourage more dangerous and aggressive behavior from our adversaries.    So I need to say right up front, we all need to work extremely closely together to ensure the funding you are appropriated is sufficient to take care of our sailors and Marines and maintain their readiness at the highest possible level.    On behalf of all of our committee members, I ask you, again, to convey to all of our sailors and Marines, our deep gratitude for their skill, determination, sacrifice, and all the things their families face while they are away on deployment.    We have much to talk about this morning. F-35, littoral combat ships, cruisers readiness, and end strength, to name just a few issues. We look forward to your comments and an informative question-and-answer session. We have a number of members here, and more are expected; quite a lot of time commitments with other hearings. But we are keenly interest and supportive of what you are doing. Let me turn to my good friend, the ranking member, Mr. Visclosky for any comments he may wish to make.                    Opening Remarks of Mr. Visclosky    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Secretary, the floor is yours, welcome.                  Summary Statement of Secretary Mabus    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you. Admiral Richardson, good morning. Thank you for being with us.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. If you could move your microphone just a little closer to you.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Admiral. General Neller.    General Neller. Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here with you this morning. Your Marines know that the Congress and the American people we serve have high expectations of us. You expect us to be ready to answer the call to fight and to win. Today, Marines remain forward deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and ready to respond to crises around the world. The posture of our force would not be possible without the support and actions of the Congress. Our global orientation, our maritime character, and expeditionary capability have all been ably demonstrated during this past year. In 2015, along with our Navy shipmates, Marines executed approximately 100 operations, 20 of them amphibious, 140 theater security cooperation events, and 160 major exercises.    Today's Marine Corps is a capable Naval force, and our forward-deployed forces are ready to fight, but we are fiscally stretched to maintain the readiness across the depths of the force, and at the same time, modernize to achieve future readiness.    As we remain engaged in the current fight and maintain our forward presence in order to respond to crises, our enemies and potential adversaries have not stood idle. They have developed new capabilities which now are comparable, and, in some cases, exceed our own. This is further complicated by a constrained resource environment from which we must continue our current operational tempo, reset our equipment, maintain our warfighting readiness, and, at the same time, modernize.    As our attention is spread across the globe in a security environment where the only certainty is uncertainty, we must make decisions about our strategy and structure that will determine our Nation's military capability in the future. The character of the 21st century is rapid evolution. It is imperative that we keep pace with change. History has not been kind to militaries that fail to change or evolve. And the change we see in the beginning of this century and beyond, we believe is dramatic.    The efforts of the 114th Congress have provided sufficient resources to support the Marine Corps' near-term readiness, and we thank the Congress for that fiscal stability. However, the President's budget for fiscal year 2017 increasingly challenges your Corps to simultaneously generate current readiness, reset our equipment after 15 years of war, and sustain our facilities and ranges, and, at the same time, modernize to ensure future readiness and capabilities.    Additionally, maintaining the quality of the men and women in today's Corps is our friendly center of gravity. In other words, that thing that we must protect. This is the foundation for which we make Marines, win our Nation's battles, and return quality citizens to our society. As the Marine Corps draws down to 182,000 Marines, we continue to develop capabilities in the fifth generation fighter, the F-35, cyber warfare, information operations, special operations, embassy security guards, in our security cooperation group. Our goal is to ensure that we set every Marine up for success on the battlefield and in life and that they understand their value to our Corps and the Nation. The Congress' intent is for the Marine Corps to serve as the Nation's force in readiness. And that guides who we are and what we do.    Being ready is central to our identity as Marines. The fiscal reductions and instability of the past years have impacted our readiness and, as resources have diminished, the Marine Corps has protected the near-term operational readiness of its forward deployed and next to deploy units in order to meet our operational commitments. This means that we do not have the depth or readiness on our bench that we would like for a major contingency.    Modernization is our future readiness. The recapitalization of our force is essential to this future readiness with investments in facilities, sustainment, equipment reset, modernization, ground combat vehicles, aviation command and control, and other capabilities. That said, with the continued support of the Congress, the Marine Corps will maintain ready forces today and modernize to generate this future readiness. The wisdom of the 82nd Congress reaffirmed by the 114th Congress remains valid today. The vital need of a strong force in readiness and your Marines are honored to serve in this role.    Again, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today and your leadership in addressing our fiscal challenges and our warfighting readiness. I look forward to your questions.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you very much, General Neller. Our focus today is on the Navy and Marine defense posture, but a lot of that is formed by the growing defense posture of both Russia and China, and this committee has been devoted in a variety of different settings to learn exactly what the Russians and Chinese are doing.    For a time when I first got on the committee, we sort of looked at the Chinese as not as great an adversary because of what we always regarded as our overwhelming superiority. But today, we see what they are doing around the world, and whatever we do, we need to get it right. And I wanted to get to the issue, which I mention to you often, Mr. Secretary, that numbers matter. The ships, I know you have been caught in some degree of crossfire, but in reality, we have the smallest Navy we have ever had. And then there is talk of, and there has been some action out of the Department of Defense to lower certain ship numbers. We need a mix. Where are we going? And are we fully capable of meeting our needs given what the Chinese are doing aggressively, and what the Russians are doing aggressively?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I am interested in the numbers. I think we are also interested in their capabilities. We are going to have a smaller fleet, and I understand we have set a high goal for more ships, a better mix. If we don't have the numbers, what are we doing to add to capabilities?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You are getting the numbers in large part because of this committee; instead of one-and-a-half Virginia class submarines, we demanded two. And if we had our power we would probably have a higher number.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, the Secretary of Defense has ordered a reduction in the number of littoral combat ships, so how does that measure up?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. And may I say, the committee is very keen on supporting our industrial base, not only for those ships, but for other ships.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I think we need a reinforced response here to get your oar in the water here.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I think it is important here. We are going to go to Mr. Crenshaw, and Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We are on your side here.    Mr. Crenshaw, then Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Ms. McCollum, and then Ms. Granger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I am all for asking for more. I think we are getting our clocks cleaned in the Arctic. Russians are doing all sorts of bad things, staking claims to areas that actually are under different sovereignties. We need to get moving here. I am all for it.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Ms. Granger, and then Mr. Ruppersberger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. Granger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yes.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. That is a very important attribution. Thank you. Mr. Ruppersberger, and then Mr. Calvert.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You are not looking for 8 more years, are you? Mr. Calvert and then Mr. Israel.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, I am sure the accolades are well deserved like they were for Fort Worth. I would like to confirm what the gentleman opined, the issue of operability here. What is operable and what is not operable that he was referring to in his initial comments? I would like the specifics.    General Neller. Let me.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Very briefly.    General Neller. Yes, sir. I keep track on a weekly basis of the maintenance schedules where all the amphib ships are. Obviously, we have equity in that. As the Secretary said, there are 30 ships, we are going to go to 34; the requirement is 38, because we anticipate 15 percent in the yard. Of the ones that are in the yard today, sir, I think a good percentage of them are in for routine maintenance and could be gotten underway if needed. So the Navy--we understand the maintenance requirements of the Navy so we are working really hard because we have a requirement to get on board those ships to train. So with the CNO and the Secretary, we are trying to be creative in how we use Marines and get them afloat, whether it is in these alternate platforms. At the end of the day, the requirement that is validated is 38 amphibs, to have 34 or two Marine expeditionary brigade forcible entry capability, but we will use these other platforms because a lot of things we do at theater security cooperations, humanitarian assistance disaster relief, NEOs even, we can do off these other ships.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, General.    Mr. Israel and then Mr. Womack.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I think this and the whole rules of engagement, the things we heard anecdotally, the things we hear from sailors that are--confrontations that occur in these regions make it apparent to some that we are not meeting those types of challenges, but absolutely, we would love to have you come back when the full evidence is on the table.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We don't want our sailors ever treated in that manner again. There should be some repercussions, maybe not to them, but perhaps to others.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We are going to try to get a second round in. Mr. Womack, and then Mr. Graves.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. This is on the record. I am sure his better half will appreciate that.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. With that said, the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Graves.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I have a few questions for General Neller about where the Marines are.    Your footprint around the world. When I think about the battle for Fallujah, the sacrifices there, things happening and problems apparently going badly. When I recall the sacrifices of all our military, but particularly Marines, what are we doing today in Iraq and Afghanistan in the Middle East, the Marine contribution? Do you have lower numbers, talk about readiness if you are always ready? What is the footprint? Your footprint around the world?    General Neller. Chairman, there are probably 31-, 32,000 Marines forward deployed, counting those west of the international date line in the Far East. In the Middle East right now, you have a Marine Expeditionary Unit that is in support of the combatant commander, you also have a Special Purpose MAGTF, and then we have some adviser teams that are directly involved with the support of the Iraqi security forces.    I would say that we are actually making progress in Iraq, albeit slower than we would like. We also have a Marine in command of a special operations task force there on MARSOC. So I am in contact with these officers, weekly, if not daily, and they keep me up to date so that in my Joint Chiefs of Staff hat I understand what is going on. So the securing of Ramadi was facilitated by some coalition Special Forces Marines that are in there. So there is--I don't want to get into numbers, but Special Purpose MAGTF, about 2,500, a good portion of them are in Iraq. The MEU, our MEU is about 2,400 Marines, and another equal number of sailors.    We have aviation in the region, along with Naval aviation, which is part of the strike package. So they are fighting, they are in there, and supporting the mission there. We have got a small number of Marines in Afghanistan advising the Georgian battalion, that do force protection at Bagram Air Force Base.    As was mentioned, the Arctic was mentioned earlier. Right now in Norway, there are about 2,000 Marines exercising with about 10 other coalition countries in Norway, up above the Arctic Circle. So we haven't been there as much as we used to go there. We have prepositioned equipment in the caves. So I am sure others are watching that we are back in Norway, training with the Norwegians and the U.K. and other countries, and we plan to go back there, because just as we are concerned about the Arctic, our Scandinavian partners and our NATO partners are also concerned.    In the Pacific, there are actually two MEUs deployed, or underway. The 31st MEU out of Sasebo and Okinawa, and the 13th MEU, which deployed off the west coast. They are headed to relieve the east coast MEU in CENTCOM, but there is a major exercise going on in the Korean Peninsula, in support of General Scaparrotti, Key Resolve and we will composite those two MEUs and do a major amphibious landing as part of that exercise, which, again, will bother the young man that leads that particular country, north of 38th parallel. We are mildly interested in what he thinks.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I know there are adversity boots on the ground, but boots that are on the ground around the world are declining, and not to take anything away from our special operators joint effort, but those numbers spiked up there, and they do remarkable work while others historically have done some remarkable work. Can you talk a little bit about the aviation piece here? I know you have a huge dependence on aviation. You have got the joint strike fighter, your fighter that has been particularly designed for your crews. Can you talk a little bit about where we stand in terms of readiness?    General Neller. We are going to--there are three versions of the joint strike fighter for the Naval force, it is the B, which is the STOVL version and the C, which is carrier version. The program of record for us is 420 aircraft, 67-C and the rest Bs. We have one operational squadron that will deploy in Japan this January. We will form another squadron this year. The airplane has aeronautically a sound talking to the air crew. I know there are concerns about where we are with the software. But we are iterating the software. We were down at the vendor, Lockheed Martin, a few weeks ago talking to them and expressed our desire to go faster, provide us more spares. So the aircraft is going to get better, but I think the real test is when you talk to the air crew that are flying, they are very, very positive and they are very, very excited. I think it is going to change for the Naval force what we can do. So now you ask where are the carriers? Where are the MEUs? Now you ask where are the Ospreys because you have an unfueled flight radius of over 500 miles, and basically globally deployable rotary wing aircraft that can take Marines anywhere in the world. Now we are going to put F-35s on an amphib ship. A fifth generation aircraft that can put most, if not the great majority of integrated air defenses around the world at risk. That is going to fly off an amphib ship.    To go back what the CNO said about command and control and iterating the ships, we are going to have to look at amphibs in a different way, because they are going to have to have the command and control to link them to the rest of the fleet as a warship, as opposed to just a ship that hauls around Marines and their stuff.    So we see great opportunity here, the F-35 needs to get the 3-F software. We are going to hold the vendor accountable for that and keep pressing them for that. We need a new airplane, and we need to refurbish our old and that is kind of the place I think all the services find themselves in is you have to maintain your legacy.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Recapitalizing.    General Neller. Recapitalizing, and you are buying new, and then when you take somebody--whenever you give somebody a new piece of kit, they have to kind of go off. It takes us 18 to 24 months to take a squadron down, give them a new airplane, train them up and then put them back out there. So we are going through that right now with every model type series we have. And so it is going to take some time. My concern is that we get enough aircraft that are flyable and our air crews get enough time to fly because people join the service; if they want to be aviators, they join to fly. We know at the same time, all our commercial air carriers are hiring.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. It is----    General Neller. Delta told us they are going to hire 900 pilots this year. So I am concerned about that which goes back to the people.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you very much. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Ms. Granger and then Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Ms. McCollum and then Mr. Crenshaw.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. McCollum. And appropriators are just as committed and interested in this subject as are our authorizers, and it will be reflected in our bill through your good efforts, and also Ms. Granger.    Yes, Mr. Crenshaw.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay, I want to make sure that members have a chance to a second round here. Mr. Israel, any comments or questions?    Then Mr. Womack.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well spoken. Mr. Womack.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you. This committee is all about stability, and thank you for underlining that, and certainly, I think, the full Appropriations Committee as well. We believe in regular order, and certainly as it affects, as it adversely affected our military in the past, we don't want to repeat that situation again.    Mr. Ruppersberger, and then Mr. Diaz-Balart, briefly.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you. Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Is that the George Washington that this committee put money into?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Diaz-Balart. I want to talk about, I know we talk about the pivot to the Pacific, and whether it is fulfilled or not. In reality, we have a pivot to Europe here. And let me say, General Breedlove landed a B-52 in our office recently in terms of some of the issues that we are facing in Europe.    What are we doing since we are moving all of these assets to the Pacific, for good reason, since we are aware that we have got a Russian aggression in all forms that are facing the U.S. Navy?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. When you were here last year, Mr. Secretary, ISIS didn't have a 150-mile bulkhead on the Mediterranean. How are we prepared to address that issue with today's Navy?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We have got instability in North Africa. We have got instability in Egypt. Our NATO ally, Turkey, has a degree of instability and I would like to see some comments relative to our confidence factor that we are ready. And I am sure the Marines will be able to provide that.    General Neller. Well, Chairman, I would say that, and the Secretary mentioned this, the Special Purpose MAGTF that was based out of Moron, and I didn't mention them as I kind of went around our force laydown. But they are a land-based force because there is not enough--we don't have an amphib ship or ships that would give them the flexibility to move around. They position their force.    We have special forces. Again, this is an unclassified hearing, but we have special forces that are operating in that part of the world, and in order to make sure that they have got somebody to back them up, those Marines position themselves during the time that they are on the other side--on the south side of the Med to react to them.    So, Admiral Richardson and I are looking at different force packaging on how we could move the ships that we have and provide a better capability for Admiral Breedlove--or General Breedlove and General Rodriguez. Clearly, they have requested an ARG/MEU to support them. And we are trying to figure out how, with the numbers of platforms we have, maybe one of these alternate platforms would be a solution or a partial solution. But you have got ISIL in Libya, and other parts, you have got Boko Haram down in Nigeria. You have got the western part of Africa, the Gulf of Guinea that the Secretary has spent a lot of time in with our partners.    So being a maritime force, and then being able to come from the sea, we can be in a multiple--we have the flexibility and agility that gets the maneuver from the sea. So I was asked earlier about amphib ships, LXR, and as the CNO mentioned, you know, I don't--I know a little bit about ships, but I know that if you build more of them at one time and you reduce your nonrecurring engineering, and we have got a proven hull form in the LPD, if there is any way that we can move any of that to the left and repeat this, you know, it would allow us to get more ships faster, and it would kind of untether us. We are on the land because we have to be on the land. We would much rather be on ship.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We need to make those types of commitment. We need more ISR. We need eyes on the ground.                                          Wednesday, March 2, 2016.              Opening Statement of Chairman Frelinghuysen    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Good morning, everybody. The committee will come to order.    This morning, the subcommittee continues a series of hearings on our defense posture, and today we focus on the Air Force.    Our two witnesses are not strangers to us. Secretary Deborah Lee James has been Secretary of the Air Force since 2013, and we always appreciate her candid and informed counsel.    Welcome, Secretary James. Thanks for being back with us.    Chief of Staff of the Air Force Mark Welsh is appearing before our committee for the last time. In coming weeks, he will be retiring from the Air Force after 40 years of dedicated service to our Nation.    General, you are a skilled and valuable advocate for the Air Force. We owe you and your family a debt of gratitude, and Godspeed to you.    And part of your family, your better part, is here----    General Welsh. Much better part.    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Betty Welsh.    And may I say thank you, Betty, for an Air Force life. Your dedication to the airmen, both here and abroad, the extraordinary things you have done. And may I add, for the committee's information, you have four children, one of whom is a Marine, so the service continues.    And we are awfully proud of you both. Thank you.    General Welsh, you caught our attention with your remarks before the recent Air Warfare Symposium. You addressed the possibility of the Air Force being called upon to fight a major theater war in Eastern Europe or Asia against a well-trained and well-equipped army. I assume you were referring to perhaps the Russians or Chinese. You said, and I quote, ``We're not really ready for that. It's going to be ugly,'' end of quotation.    An assessment like that from someone of your experience should be of concern to our committee and to the Nation, but the facts are the facts. We have the oldest Air Force aircraft in history and the smallest Air Force in years.    At the same time, the Chinese Air Force, the third largest air force in the world, is rapidly closing the gap with ours across a broad spectrum of capabilities: quality of their aircraft, command and control, radar, electronic warfare, and data links. China also possesses one of the largest forces of advanced, long-range surface-to-air missiles in the world and some pretty sophisticated space architecture.    Russia is procuring some new Flanker fighters and developing a fifth-generation PAK FA fighter. The Kremlin also plans to build 56 long-range, advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile battalions. They put down their markers for a lot of firepower, both in Syria and Iran, and deployed air forces to protect it.    Elsewhere, Iran and other nations are working to buy additional advanced air defense missile systems from Russia.    And while you and our committee are focusing on these rising threats our Air Force and those of coalition nations are actively engaged with ISIS and Al Qaeda in the Middle East and the Taliban and ISIS in Afghanistan.    While paying tribute to the bravery and skill of our aviators, some suggest that airpower alone will not destroy these forces or even bring them to their knees, that boots on the ground will only assure that.    Of course, we need to keep all of these challenges in mind as we go through this year's budget process. And the committee is anxious to hear your perspective on how the Air Force will maintain its aging fleet of bombers and fighters amidst growing demand for their services and the readiness of those who operate them, and, may I add, their youth relative to the age of the aircraft.    And I am sure members will have questions about JSTARS, the Russian rocket engines, the A-10 and the nuclear enterprise, and your continuing needs for ISR--intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. But a major issue hovering over the Air Force and the entire Defense Department these days is the looming bow wave of major acquisition programs. And I am sure you will address a lot of those issues in your testimony.    We also saw the headline recently which read, ``The Coming Dogfight Between the F-35 and the New Bomber.'' These are the two most sophisticated and expensive planes ever, and we need to hear how the Air Force proposes to fund both.    In closing, Secretary James, General Welsh, the committee hopes you will convey to your airmen, officers, and enlisted, wherever they are, at home and abroad, our deep gratitude for their remarkable service each and every day.    I am pleased to yield to Mr. Visclosky for any remarks he may wish to make.                    Opening Remarks of Mr. Visclosky    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Secretary James, welcome. Thank you.                  Summary Statement of Secretary James    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, thank you, Madam Secretary.    General Welsh, front and center.                   Summary Statement of General Welsh    General Welsh. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Visclosky. And a special thank you for recognizing my wife. Betty is magic. And the fact that you took the time to acknowledge her presence here today, I just can't thank you enough, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.    Members of the committee, it is always an honor to be here with you, and it is privilege to be here with Secretary James representing our remarkable Airmen.    I would like to briefly address just two issues that are pressing on the Air Force today: first, the health of the remotely piloted aircraft enterprise, which we get a lot of questions about, including some from members of this committee; and, second, pilot retention.    First, the RPA enterprise. We are laser-focused on improving the quality of life and establishing a manageable, long-term, livable battle rhythm for our remotely piloted aircraft community.    The explosion in people, platforms, and resources that constitute this community, the medium altitude ISR community, since 2001 has been stunning, and so has the volume and the quality of the work they have done in the battlefield. Because the mission area grew so rapidly, we have never gotten ahead of the training curve. And each year, recently, more pilots were leaving the remotely piloted aircraft force than we were able to train to go into it. Not good math for us.    The Secretary of Defense helped us this last year by freezing the global requirement for RPA caps for the Air Force at 60, which is 5 below the 65 we were operating with 55 cap's worth of people, which meant our people were in a surge mode nonstop. This allows us to fully man our training units for the first time ever and to build our RPA pilot training pipeline to where it needs to be. By the end of fiscal year 2017, we will be training 384 pilots a year in the RPAs. That is 200 more than we have ever produced in a year in the past.    This is the first and the most significant step in the overall RPA get-well plan, intended to improve quality of life for our RPA airmen and their families. That plan also includes incentive pay increases and bonuses for crews, standardized organizational constructs, and crew ratios designed to allow sanity back into their schedule, and greater Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve operational mission activity to relieve some of the pressure on the Active Duty force.    Air Combat Command also initiated an internal grassroots review that made over 140 recommendations that we are now working to close.    As part of that effort, we intend to bed-down an RPA operations group with the ability to execute missions around the world at a new Contiguous United States (CONUS) location on an existing installation approximately a year from now and then a full RPA wing at another location approximately 2 years from now. Both will provide additional assignment options for a force that has been very limited in their choice of locations up till now. Essentially, most of our RPA pilots went from Creech Air Force Base to Holloman Air Force Base to somewhere overseas. That was their entire career track up till this point.    In the future, we are also planning to place RPA units overseas in both Europe and the Pacific. For years now, our RPA teams have been planning and executing lifesaving and life-taking missions, but until now there has been absolutely no normal in their lifestyle. They deserve the same care, feeding, and professional development stemming from careers guided by a normalized roadmap, and that is where we are headed. Air Combat Command's hard work on this get-well plan is intended to light the way for us.    No Airman joins the service to get wealthy, but the unmanned aviation bonuses and incentive payments that you have appropriated do help us with recruitment and retention. And I just wanted to thank you for your support in that effort. But on their own, they aren't enough. If we do not fix quality of life for our RPA operators and their families, they won't stay in the Air Force. So we are committed to fixing this.    The second issue is pilot retention, because the long-awaited pilot retention problem is here. In calendar year 2015, major airlines hired about 3,500 pilots, and they expect to keep hiring at a commensurate rate for the next nine to ten years. Military pilots are in the perfect position to fill those jobs. They are highly trained, they are experienced, and, thus, they are very attractive to the airlines.    Each year, we hope to retain about 65 percent of the pilots who are eligible to separate from the Air Force. One of the major tools we use in that retention effort is our aviation retention pay that you appropriate for us. The take rate in 2015 was just 55 percent, so 10 percent below the average.    Proficient Air Force pilots can potentially transition from being a company-grade officer in the Air Force to being a commercial captain in a few short years with an airline salary that is roughly two times higher than military pay with someone of equivalent experience.    And while we cannot reasonably expect to stop the outflow, we are doing everything in our power to mitigate it and to convince those pilots who are on the fence to stay with us and those who are leaving to go into the Guard and Reserve.    We are increasing pilot production to maximum schoolhouse capacity. We are revisiting the operational demand signal for pilots in nonflying jobs. We are partnering with RAND Corporation to fully assess the net effects of this hiring surge by the airlines. And we intend to seek legislation to increase all aviation retention pay for manned and unmanned platform pilots to $35,000 per year. And we will ensure that you have all the details you need to assess that proposal.    Ladies and gentlemen, my personal thanks to each of you for routinely dedicating your time and attention to our Air Force and to those proud Americans who give it life. The Secretary and I look forward to your questions.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, General.    We have a lot of chairs, and the ranking member is sitting at the table here today, and there is a keen interest in asking questions. Mr. Womack would like to have Chairman Cole have his opportunity to be here today.    So, in an unselfish act, I am going to recognize you for the first question so you can go relieve him.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Womack.    Ms. McCollum and then Judge Carter.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. McCollum.    Judge Carter and then Mr. Ruppersberger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Judge Carter.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Oh, did you have another question?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay. Thank you.    Mr. Ruppersberger and then Ms. Granger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Ruppersberger.    Ms. Granger and then Mr. Ryan.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. Granger.    Mr. Ryan and then Mr. Crenshaw.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We always enjoy looking at you----    Mr. Frelinghuysen . Listening to you.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We are always proud of the Buckeye contribution, and I am sure the Air Force has duly noted it.    Mr. Crenshaw and then Mr. Graves, who is very patient at the end there.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. This is an imperative. And you are going to be reporting, I think, to the committee in pretty short order as to where we stand.    General Welsh. Yes, sir.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay. Thank you very much.    Mr. Calvert--excuse me, Mr. Graves, I wanted to recognize Chairman Calvert, who actually was ahead of you.    Mr. Calvert.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Would the gentleman yield?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. And then you are making a similar investment with the Blue Origin.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Maybe we can give the committee some perspective. We're talking about, I think, spending, I think, to date, what is it, $750 million or something. It is some incredible amount.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yes.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Put some numbers, if you would, if you--thank you for yielding.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Please do. Yeah. I think----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay. Who do we have? Mr. Graves.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    General Welsh. Chairman, if I could just point out, that would be--now be, at that point in time, our seventh fleet of aircraft that would be over 50 years old.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So noted with alarm.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Just getting back to Congressman Calvert's question about the RD-180, if we don't have the capacity, we are dependent on these Russian engines, right? How else are we going to do whatever we need to do for the next couple of years without them?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. This is a national security issue here.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I mentioned in my opening remarks about the capacities of the Russian Air Force and the Chinese. Certainly, there has been a lot of aggressive behavior. In some cases, we are deconflicting with them over Syria, and at times, they appear to have us, sort of, butt out. The Chinese have been doing some pretty remarkable things in the South China Seas. A lot of aspirations, a lot of their own capabilities. How are we matched against their, General Welsh, or, Madam Secretary, against some of their capacities?    General Welsh. Sir, right now capacity-wise, let's start with the Chinese, they have about 325,000 people in the People's Liberation Army/Air Force, which is a little bit--about the same size as we are, a little bit larger. But we have a couple thousand more aircraft today. The rate they are building, the models they are fielding, by 2030, they will have fielded--they will have made up that 2,000 aircraft gap. And they will be at least as big, if not bigger than our Air Force is in terms of aircraft. And they will have to go to the people with it to operate them, so they will be significantly larger in terms of people.    They also, during that timeframe, will field a number of new aircraft, a handful full of new--completely new variants, and will have modified three of their older variants in that same timeframe. And we are not keeping up with that kind of technology, development.    We are still in the position of we have--we will have the best technology in the battle space, especially if we can continue with our current big three modernization programs, the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRSB) and the F-35. But they will have a lot of technology that is better than the stuff we have had before. And so the--what the--and the Russians are doing the same thing in the nuclear business. Not so much in the conventional force, but they are demonstrating capabilities that they haven't demonstrated to us before, cruise missiles. Some of their new aircraft are dropping weapons for the first time in conflict. We are able to watch and see how this is working.    So they are a serious Air Force. And they are serious about getting better. And the Chinese, in particular, clearly have a blueprint that is matching against our shortfalls. And so I think that is something that we have to consider as we look to the future. Not modernizing our Air Force is not an answer that is acceptable.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Sometimes it is a sensitive subject, but there is an issue of rules of engagement. We had the Navy in here the other day, and we discussed the history of free passage and free navigation. You know, we look at things that the Chinese are requiring of us today. How do you deal with that issue? I don't think it is just anecdotal. There are challenges that our airmen are facing that sometimes we don't hear about.    What are the rules of engagement? And how would you characterize some of the instances we have read about, in terms of the Chinese, shall we say, confronting our aircraft? The Russians, I assume, in other parts of the world have been going across the East Coast and at times obviously doing a variety of surveillance. How are we matching that?    General Welsh. Sir, the--I am assuming you are talking about the intercepts of aircraft that are----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yes, I am.    General Welsh . Being conducted.    There have been incidents where we thought the intercept and the contact of the pilot after the intercept was not acceptable. It was certainly not within the bounds of normal behavior. But there have not been that many of them, relatively speaking. And when there is one, it is highlighted. We actually do communicate with both the Russians and the Chinese and point out to them the behavior. And the behavior tends to adjust. For example, in the East China Sea, we had an issue with aircraft from a particular unit that were intercepting some of our ISR platforms that were behaving aggressively. And after a demarche following that, that behavior changed.    So it is not--when you read about it, it is really an isolated incident, in my view, compared to the majority of intercepts which are relatively professionally accomplished. And that is true both with China and Russia. We also intercept their platforms when they fly either around Europe or they fly around the coast of the United States. And we have the same protocols. We----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. What about the issue of denial of airspace?    General Welsh. Well----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We read from time to time of symbolic flights. But in reality, have we conceded anything?    General Welsh. No, sir. In the South China Sea, for example, as the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command repeatedly states, we have not changed our patterns, we have freedom of navigation in that area. We still do overflight of that area. We have made it very clear that that is not a Chinese restricted zone of any type, either on the sea or in the air.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Joint strike fighter, the ALIS system, can we talk a little bit about some of the issues that you have been focusing on to get that system right and tell us why it is so important?    General Welsh. The two big issues that I believe exist between now and initial operational capability this fall, our window is August to December to clear that, and I am pretty confident we are going to get there from here. The two issues have been development of the automated logistics information system. It has been a complicated process. It has been difficult journey that the companies and the services have been on trying to get this to where it needs to be for the future.    But I am actually relatively confident we will get there for what we need to have at IOC. The biggest issue right now is getting engine data incorporated into Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) because it comes from a different contractor. And the companies have been working together trying to make this happen. And I am expecting to have that data integrated in July. And that will give us a month or so to look at how it operates, make sure it is working properly before we enter our IOC window.    The other issue that--Lockheed Martin, in particular, and their subcontractors are paying an awful lot of attention to is a software problem, and it has to do with radar stability. It is software stability, but it is really radar stability. And they have been working this extremely hard. They now have their software integration labs on 24/7, 7-day-a-week operations doing multiple quick iterations of software changes.    They are fielding a recommended change to the software they think will field this problem. They have done it in the labs in February. They are putting it into platforms in March. And we hope we will be able to put it in the airplanes shortly thereafter to make sure that it is working. So those are the two big things, sir. But I think we will get there.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. There has been some loose talk, and I think it is hopefully on the loose, that somehow people--some might bypass this new system of systems here. And that is something I don't think would be advisable.    General Welsh. As far as bypassing the F-35?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. No, not the F-35, but trying to get around the--what you tell me is going to be a good news story at some point time.    General Welsh. Oh, yes, sir. No. We cannot get around----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We can't do that.    General Welsh. We got to run forehead first right through the middle of it. Yeah. This has got to work, the airplane's got to do what we were told it would do, and what the requirements demand that it does, clearly. And that is where we are going.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Further questions, members?    Yes, Mr. Visclosky. Excuse me.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Judge Carter.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We need to talk more often.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Mr. Aderholt.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Ruppersberger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    The Air Force and other services have some immediate needs. They are often reflected in the OCO account, what we used to call the directed funding for the war on terror. You have some money in there, I think over $400 million, to procure some additional Reapers. What else do you have in there and why are those types of investments important? I know there have been some issues relative to losses. I assume there is some reasons we have had these losses. What else is in there? Because we have a fight on our hands right now. We can look towards the Russians' and Chinese' long-range capabilities. So what are we doing, should we say, on the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda and other groups, the capabilities there?    General Welsh. One of the notable things that we--you have actually helped us with immensely, but we can always use more help in this arena is buying munitions. You know, we have authority this year now to buy munitions on a forecast usage rate instead of dropping a bomb and then waiting three budget cycles before we actually get it replaced.    Now, what we have been doing for the last 15 years is raiding our operational stocks to support major war plans in order to do the current day-to-day business with the weapons that we are expending in the Middle East. This ability to forecast expenditure for the next year and then put Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) money against buying against it before we drop the bombs is helping stabilize that. But it is not replacing the stockpiles. The stockpiles are still down. We need to think about that. It is a serious problem. And we are at a point where we have to have some kind of money other than OCO to get at it because----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Because we don't really focus on munitions, I mean, really.    General Welsh. No, sir. And we have got to go to the companies and say: You need to be able to increase your production capacity in some cases, if we really want to refresh the stockpiles. To do that it can't be OCO money. It has got to be money that has a tail on it. So anything we could do in that regard to free up money to use for munitions is going to be helpful for us every year.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I shared with you yesterday when your were kind enough to pay a courtesy call with me and with Peter, Ranking Member Visclosky, that you were complimentary of our investment, and you were this morning of--on ISR. And I have to say, as I said General Breedlove has brought--you know, he has--the amount of ISR that is out there, not only relative to his command, Central and South America, Africa, these are areas that have immediate needs, I assume, right?    General Welsh. Chairman, they do. I would just add one caution. I mentioned it before. The way we got after the ISR shortfall starting in 2008, is we just got--we were told buy as much as you can. Field it as fast as you can. That led to the problem we have in the Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) enterprise today because we didn't keep up with the people. We bought the equipment and we kind of created the people as we went and took it from other places. If we want to increase the numbers in the RPA enterprise, or the ISR enterprise, we have got to look to the future, plan on having money ahead of time, and build a plan that we can actually execute and have the people to actually implement and run the system. That may require a plus-up on a top line of manpower for the Air Force. But we need to be able to look at it to plan ahead of time and show it to you. Otherwise, we are going to be in this thrash we have been in for the last 8 or 9 years in the ISR arena forever.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. And what are you doing to assure everybody has a piece of the cyber, you know, advocacy? What are we doing to make sure that we are working jointly?    General Welsh. Sir, every----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So those resources are not--we can have an accounting for them.    General Welsh. Sir, the boss mentioned the joint information environment. That is a joint single network for the Department intended to bring all of our services and OSD together on a single network for everybody from the warfighters to the folks back in the Pentagon. That is a multiservice contribution. Everybody is contributing both money, manpower, planning, and resources to make this thing happen. We are in--right in the--you know, right with the rest of the pack running as fast as we can to make that a reality. That will force us into joint--in the information architecture arena. Now that is step one. We have some regional security stacks that go with that which are the way the warfighters actually connect into and out of this system. Those are also joint. They are being executed in the major commands, and they will be done with air components included in the discussion with everybody else.    So this is now a joint discussion. All the information systems we have from the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) that moves our intel data around are all connected to everybody now. And so we have just got to make sure that we keep moving in that direction. And I think we are clearly on that path.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We like the connections. We hope all those links are well protected and hardened.    Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Aderholt.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I would like to close on a positive note, but the initials OCX, where do we stand? We have made substantial investments there. Maybe you want to call on Betty to----    General Welsh. This is where I drop my pen.                                           Thursday, March 3, 2016.              Opening Statement of Chairman Frelinghuysen    Mr. Frelinghuysen. The committee will come to order. We are going to proceed as quickly as we can, knowing that there is a series of votes.    This morning, the committee continues a series of open defense posture and budget hearings. Today, the committee will receive testimony on the posture of the United States Army and its fiscal year 2017 budget. We welcome two Army leaders in new positions to the witness table: the Honorable Patrick Murphy, acting Secretary of the Army; and General Mark Milley, Chief of Staff of the Army. Secretary Murphy was recently sworn in as Under Secretary of the Army and serves as acting Secretary of the Army. He previously served with us here in Congress from 2007 to 2011. He is also an Army veteran, including service in Bosnia, and then with the 82nd Airborne in Baghdad.    Secretary Murphy, welcome, and thank you for your continuing service to our Nation. Great to have you here.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We also welcome for the first time General Mark A. Milley, the 39th Chief of Staff of the Army. General Milley has held multiple command and staff positions in eight divisions and the Special Forces throughout the last 35 years, most recently as the 21st Commander of the U.S. Army Forces Command, Fort Bragg.    General Milley, thank you for being with us.    Gentlemen, as you know there was a time in the recent past when some experts saw a declining need for U.S. land power and actually planned for a smaller less capable Army. Such thinking was clearly wrong. While the United States remains the most formidable ground combat force on Earth, declining end strength and a frozen budget will challenge the Army's ability to answer the bell when asked by future Commanders in Chief. For now, the Army is very much engaged in Afghanistan, trying to secure the hard-fought gains we made over the last 15 years of conflict, even as plans for our departure have been postponed. We also have soldiers advising and assisting and still in harm's way in Iraq, Syria, Africa, and around the world; some in small operations, some in larger, all of those operations complex. The Army has a missile defense mission in the Persian Gulf, and a peacekeeping mission, an enduring one, in the Sinai. Over 28,000 soldiers stand alert in South Korea against the unpredictable regime to the north.    At the same time, the need for a strong capable Army is underscored by new threats. You stand against Russian belligerents in Europe and act to deter a newly aggressive China, which I may say has the largest Army in the world. In fact, as we meet here today, our Army has nearly well over 200,000 soldiers deployed in 140 countries. For these reasons, the Army has presented a budget that emphasizes readiness to ensure our soldiers are prepared for whatever our unpredictable world brings.    But, gentlemen, this appears to be a status quo budget. The funding level of 2017 request nearly mirrors the current levels. After the return of forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, the expectation had been that units would return to full spectrum training, yet the Army's operational tempo has not slowed down, and since then, additional units, equipment, and soldiers have deployed to Eastern Europe to deter and defeat Russian aggression. Meanwhile, critical maintenance has been delayed and infrastructure repairs postponed.    Properly funding readiness, however, comes at a cost, primarily in the form of major reductions to large modernization programs. Most notably, it appears that Army aviation is the major billpayer for preserving readiness. This comes at a time when we are hearing Army leadership saying that additional aviation assets are their highest priority as they seek to deter Russia.    I would add that the National Commission on the Future of the Army is strongly recommending that the Army actually expand aircraft procurement to meet demands for air power on the Korean Peninsula and in Europe, and to ensure that the National Guard remains a viable partner.    Another challenge you face is the steady drawdown of your end strength numbers based on mission assumptions made several years ago. The world has dramatically changed in the last 2 years, and so have our strategic challenges. Remembering the repeated combat rotations, the 18-month deployments of recent years, today, we will discuss whether you believe the Army is properly sized to meet its range of requirements. The committee certainly appreciates the complexity of these challenges that are before you. We know these are dangerous times and will do everything we can to provide you with the resources you need, even if they are not always in your budget request.    In that regard, I want to call to your attention the study sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense to explore Army lethality. We all agree that we never want to send our soldiers and marines into a fair fight; we must maintain the upper hand. The subcommittee directed this research out of concern that our historic lethality overmatch over our adversaries is eroding and, in some cases, has been lost entirely. Specifically, we were concerned about the lethality of individual soldiers in small units and about field artillery that has not kept pace with technological advances. We are concerned about the losses we are facing in range, response time, accuracy, and lethal effects to name a few. To illustrate a point, I would point the committee's attention as it has been--we have been giving our attention to eastern Ukraine where we have seen a relatively new Russian technology--artillery, armor, small arms--used to great effect. This is one of reasons the subcommittee provided $314 million in new funding last year to begin up-gunning some of our Stryker Combat Vehicles. I would also add that China has made some impressive gains in these vital areas as well. This important study should be landing on your desk shortly, and I look forward for working with you to fill those gaps.    I would like to hear from you and your staff on actual recommendations for fiscal year 2017.    Secretary Murphy, General Milley, I want to close by asking you to convey to our soldiers and their families how much this committee appreciates their work and their sacrifice to each and every day. You represent the best of America. You look after the best of America. And it has been our pleasure and honor to work with you as well as with your predecessors.    I am very pleased to yield to my ranking member, Mr. Visclosky.                        Remarks of Mr. Visclosky    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Secretary Murphy, welcome. Welcome back. It is different to have you on the other side of the dais, but we are glad you are here.                 Summary Statement of Secretary Murphy    Mr. Frelinghuysen. And you will have that support. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.    General Milley, thank you for being with us.                  Summary Statement of General Milley    General Milley. Thank you, Chairman Frelinghuysen.    And thanks, Ranking Member Visclosky and everyone else that is here and all the distinguished members of the committee, for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss your Army. And thank you for your consistent support and commitment to our Army soldiers and civilians and families. And thank you for supporting this budget.    Six months ago, when confirmed as the 39th chief of staff, I committed to you and the American people to ensure that this Nation has the Army it needs and is postured for an uncertain and increasingly complex future and that we must remain the world's most cable, versatile and lethal ground force valued by our friends and feared by our enemies. This mission has one common thread, and that thread is readiness.    A ready Army is manned, trained, equipped, and well led as the foundation of America's joint force. In order to conduct missions, to deter, and, if deterrence fails, to defeat a wide range of state and nonstate actors today, tomorrow, and into the future. Fifteen years of continuous counterinsurgency operations combined with recent reduced and unpredictable budgets has created a gap in our proficiency to conduct combined arms operations against enemy conventional or hybrid forces, resulting in an Army today that is less than ready to fight and win against emerging threats.    America is a global power, and our Army must be capable of meeting a wide variety of threats under varying conditions anywhere on Earth. Our challenge today is to sustain the counterterrorist and counterinsurgency capabilities that we have developed to a high degree of proficiency over the last 15 years of war but simultaneously rebuild the capability to win in ground combat against higher end threats. We can wish away this latter case. But we would be foolish as a Nation to do so.    This budget prioritizes readiness because the global security environment is increasingly uncertain and complex. Today, we see in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa radical terrorism and the malign influence of Iran threatening that regional order. In Europe, we see a revanchist Russia who has modernized its military, invaded several foreign countries, and continues to act aggressively toward its neighbors using multiple means of national power.    In Asia, in the Pacific, there are complex systemic challenges with a rising China that is increasingly assertive militarily, and a very provocative North Korea. Both situations creating the conditions for potential conflict.    While we cannot forecast precisely when and where the next contingency will arise, it is my professional military view that if any contingency happens, it will likely require a significant amount of United States Army ground forces. If one or more possible unforeseen contingencies happen, then we, the United States Army, risk not having ready forces available to provide flexible options to our national leadership, and if committed, we risk not being able to accomplish the strategic tasks at hand in an acceptable amount of time. And, most importantly, we risk incurring significantly increased U.S. casualties.    In sum, we risk the ability to conduct ground operations of sufficient scale and ample duration to achieve strategic objectives or win decisively at an acceptable cost against a highly lethal hybrid threat or near-peer adversary in the unforgiving environment of ground combat.    The Army is currently committed to winning our fight against radical terrorists and deterring conflict in other parts of the globe. The Army provides 46 percent of all global combatant commander demand on an annual basis. And we provide 64 percent of all emerging or unforecasted combatant commander demand. And as the chairman noted, we have over 200,000 soldiers currently deployed all around the globe.    To sustain current operations and to mitigate the risk of deploying an unready force into future combat operations, the Army will continue--and we must--to prioritize and fully fund readiness over end strength modernization and infrastructure. We prefer investment in both current and future readiness. The security environment of today, however, and the near future drive our investment into current readiness for global operations and potential contingencies.    So, specifically, we ask that you support and fully fund the manning and equipping of our combat formations and our ability to conduct realistic combined arms combat training at both home station and our combat training centers.    Additionally, we ask your support for our modernization in five key capability areas. We ask support for aviation, command and control of the network, integrated air and missile defense, combat vehicles, and emerging threat programs. And, finally, we ask your continued support for our soldiers and families to recruit and retain high quality soldiers of character and competence.    And I also want to acknowledge in closing the great work of the National Commission for the Future of the Army. And we as a Total Army are embracing the report. We are reviewing all of their recommendations and will report back through the Secretary of Defense on the way forward and our thoughts about the 63 findings within the Commission's report. So, in order to best utilize the resources provided, we intend to continue to streamline our headquarters, ruthlessly cut activities that do not contribute to an effective fighting force, and we do ask for another round of BRAC. We request your support for the proposed budget as written, and we thank Congress for your Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 which provided short-term relief and 2 years of predictable funding. With your support, we will be able to build readiness for contingencies, invest selectively in the readiness of our future force. And I thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward to your questions.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, General Milley.    Vice Chair Kay Granger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Israel.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Israel.    Mr. Crenshaw.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Crenshaw.    Mr. Visclosky.    And let me apologize to both of our witnesses today for what is obvious that we have got some votes that are causing some turmoil and disruption of this hearing. But we are so proud you are here, and we want to obviously focus on your needs and deliver for you.    Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Let me associate myself with Mr. Visclosky's remarks. This is obviously a commitment of every member of this committee. Many of us just got through quite a remarkable academy review process. And I have to say: You have the best of America in your ranks, whether they are on their way to West Point or whether they are at the recruiting station. And so I do want to associate myself with Mr. Visclosky's feeling. And may I say, of those that I appoint to West Point and to the Naval Academy, I have to say for the record most of those young women are far better, have their act together than a lot of the young men that I interview. And to think that they would ever be in a system where this type of situation would continue to exist, of course, is totally unacceptable. And we are very confident from what you are telling us here today that this is--you are bringing the hammer down after, obviously, giving people due process and their rights within the military justice system. Thank you for----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yes.    Ms. Granger, any questions?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We are going to welcome the chairman of the whole committee here, Hal Rogers.    As he gets to his seat, General, I would like you to address the 12 recommendations in the National Commission of--I want you to comment on the plan issue of end strength, the recommendations there, and why that is important, given what is happening around the world in terms of conventional military responsibility, as well as the unconventional forces that we support.    General Milley. Thank you, chairman. This goes--I believe the question, Mr. Chairman, is about the size of the Army, Total Army. First, let me say that the United States Army is not a small army. Right today, we are almost a million soldiers strong, broken out--and this budget takes us to an Army of 980,000 strong with 450,000 in the Active, 335 in the National Guard, and 195,000 in the United States Army Reserve. And with that size force, the question is, size force to do what? So the size of a force is only relative to the tasks that you are required to do based on the National Security Strategy, the National Military Strategy Defense Planning Guidance and other strategic documents. Our analysis says that, in my view anyway, my military analysis says that that size force, as it translates into specific capabilities, such as ground maneuver, Brigade Combat Teams, air defense, ISR, and so own and so forth, that size force is able to do the National Strategy but at a degree of risk. So the question isn't an absolute question of how many numbers; it is a question of how much risk the Nation is willing to take relative to the tasks that are charged to the military in the various strategic documents.    In my view, that risk is, for the Army anyway, for us to accomplish the tasks that we have to accomplish in the strategies, to do those tasks in accordance with the timelines that are basically laid out, and in an acceptable level of cost in terms of U.S. casualties, I think we are putting the Nation at increased risk. In a classified version, I will be happy to discuss the exact details of that risk and what level I have apportioned that risk. And I think that is well-known. I think that is well-known. And the Secretary of Defense and others have also testified to that. So, as the force gets smaller, risk increases. Having said that, we have to compensate for it by a highly ready force. So the size of the force is one factor but also the readiness of the force. So we have to compensate and mitigate with very, very high levels of readiness, high levels of responsiveness, and high levels of technological capabilities. The Secretary of Defense's guidance to us was to buy us capability over capacity. In other words, skills over size. Having said that, quality is not just based on that. Quantity has a quality all its own, as the saying goes. So the size of the force, the end strength, and the capabilities associated with it, the number of brigades, number of enablers, et cetera, is a concern. And it is really reflective of how much risk we are willing to take. And I have advised on what I think my military judgment is on that risk to the appropriate authorities.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, General.    Pleased to recognize the full chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Rogers.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Kaptur.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. Kaptur.    Mr. Womack.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You guys have got your stuff together. We like it.    General Milley. My mother's name is Murphy. We are actually cousins.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, thank you, Mr. Womack, and you obviously include Kentucky and Maryland in those numbers too.    Chairman Rogers and then Mr. Ruppersberger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We don't want to endorse Volkswagen too quickly these days, so maybe we will choose another----    General Milley. Bad choice.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yeah. Mr. Ruppersberger and then Mr. Cole.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Great. Thank you.    The gentleman from Oklahoma.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Mr. Ryan and then Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, respectfully, we also need to know what we are doing around the world, and that is why Congress in a bipartisan way has looked for what the Defense Department's plans and strategies are all about and how they are going to be implemented. And we are here today, obviously, to support the Army's important role.    And there is the issue of accountability. We have some systems that we work on here with all of our services where it is incredible. We talked about acquisition and procurement, and our committee worked very closely with Chairman Thornberry. You know, the taxpayers also have a right to know that--you know, I was involved with the Future Combat Systems, you know. I mean, I defended it, but my God, we have had some enormous expensive failures. We have been able to draw from some of those technologies, but in reality, a lot of money was wasted. So I share your feeling. I am not sure about the tax issue, but certainly, I feel your feeling that we do need more money rather than less.    Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Judge Carter, the center of military might, right, in Texas.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Judge Carter.    Mr. Visclosky, and if there are others that have some questions, if you could just let me know, so we can round the bases and look toward the end or adjournment.                                           Tuesday, March 22, 2016.              Opening Statement of Chairman Frelinghuysen    Mr. Frelinghuysen. The committee will come to order.    This afternoon, the committee conducts an open oversight hearing on the posture of the National Guard and Army Reserves. We are pleased to welcome four distinguished general officers as witnesses.    General Frank J. Grass is the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, a permanent member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, representing more than 467,000 citizen soldiers and airmen in the Army and Air National Guard. General Grass has appeared before this committee in this capacity on a number of occasions, and it has always been a pleasure to have him here. However, this will be his last appearance before the committee. General Grass is retiring this fall.    General Grass, you have led the Guard through some challenging times. We wish you well in your retirement, and thank you for all the good work you have done on behalf of the men and women of our Armed Forces.    Lieutenant General Timothy Kadavy is the Director of the Army National Guard, consisting of 28 fully capable brigade combat teams. This is General Kadavy's first year to testify before the committee.    Welcome, General.    Major General Brian Neal is the Acting Director of the Air National Guard. This is General Neal's first year to testify before this subcommittee.    General, we appreciate the experience and expertise that you bring to this hearing.    And, finally, we are pleased to welcome the Chief of the U.S. Army Reserve, Lieutenant General Jeff Talley. His units total over 200,000 soldiers. General Talley has testified before this committee many times. Unfortunately, this will also be his final appearance as he, too, is preparing to retire.    Welcome, General Talley, and thank you for your service to our Nation.    And we have discussed repeatedly in this room, the country is facing more serious threats from more sources than at any time since World War II. The ISIS franchise, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups are active in the Middle East, North Africa, and, really, literally around the world. Russia continues to menace Ukraine, its neighbors, and our NATO partners. China is rapidly expanding its military and naval and air and space capabilities. In short, no one knows for sure where the next conflict will develop forcing us to respond militarily.    Generals, this country relies now, perhaps more than ever, upon the service of your citizen soldiers and airmen to ensure mission success. Our Guard and Reserve units performed magnificently in Afghanistan and Iraq and continue to do so throughout the world, and the committee would like to commend them for their dedication and time away from home and family.    All these factors make the dedication of our Reserve forces even more laudable. That said, the committee is deeply concerned about their readiness following 15 years of war. We are eager to hear your testimony, which will assist the committee to better determine the needs of the men and women who make up the Guard and the Reserve.    It has been this committee's long tradition to work to ensure that the Reserve component is properly equipped and trained. Even with the recent budget constraints, this committee will continue to do everything possible to ensure adequate funding to enhance readiness for both your homeland and overseas missions.    Generals, we look forward to your testimony, but, first, I would like to call upon my ranking member, Mr. Visclosky, for any comments he may wish to make.                        Remarks of Mr. Visclosky    Mr. Frelinghuysen. General Grass, the floor is yours. Thank you for being here.                   Summary Statement of General Grass    General Grass. Thank you, Chairman.    Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, and distinguished members of this subcommittee, it is a pleasure to be here today with my fellow Guard and Reserve leaders. I am honored to represent the men and women of the National Guard, both Army and Air, their families, communities, and employers who support them.    I would first like to send my condolences to the people affected by the deadly bombings today in Brussels. This act of terrorism on the lives of innocent individuals is a tragic reminder of the security challenges we face both at home and abroad.    The Guard is tremendously appreciative of this committee's support. Your investment has resulted in the finest, most diverse National Guard that I have seen throughout my career.    In countries such as Afghanistan, Djibouti, Iraq, Kosovo, Qatar, the Sinai, and many other locations, our Guardsmen work seamlessly with their Active component counterparts to ensure security around the world. Since 9/11, the Guard has mobilized nearly 780,000 citizen soldiers and airmen, conducting complex operations around the globe.    The experience and capabilities gained from our Federal mission, along with the equipment and leadership skills utilized overseas, yields a highly responsive National Guard here in the homeland, with roughly 3,000 to 4,000 citizen soldiers and airmen on duty every day here in the homeland.    Of course, the success of our warfight and our homeland mission is directly related to the incredible and enduring partnerships with international, Federal, State, and local partners. Our Nation is currently facing unprecedented security challenges both at home and abroad. These challenges come during a turbulent fiscal environment.    Your passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act brought some much-needed relief. However, sequester levels of funding could result in the smallest National Guard since the end of the Korean war. Since that time, our U.S. population has doubled. Your continued investment in training, manning, equipping is needed to maintain the readiness of your National Guard as a combat reserve of the Army and Air Force, the same force that is called upon by the Governors in times of need here in the homeland.    Generals Kadavy and Neal will further elaborate on specific Army and Air Guard issues, so I won't go into too much detail. However, I would like to briefly emphasize a few key points and programs that need your continued support.    First, our Full-Time Manning Program is absolutely critical to delivering the very foundational levels of readiness needed during global and homeland crisis.    Second, our successful State Partnership Program has established enduring partnerships with 76 nations. Many have and continue to participate in coalition operations worldwide and have improved their interoperability with U.S. forces.    Third, our counter-drug program is a crucial tool in the whole-of-government approach to combating transnational organized crime.    Fourth, our National Guard's cyber program provides the Nation with cutting-edge capabilities to protect our Nation's critical infrastructure and systems and utilizes the skills our citizen soldiers and airmen gain through their civilian careers.    Fifth, with roughly 140,000 graduates, the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program provides at-risk youth with an opportunity to learn skills, get an education, and have an opportunity in life.    Lastly, I want to thank you for your support of the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account. Your valuable investment in NGREA enables us to fulfill our domestic and overseas missions.    Your support for these programs as well as other programs that allow us to accomplish our mission and take care of our service members and their families in our communities is greatly appreciated.    Recently, the National Commission on the Future of the Army came out with its recommendations. I thank the Commission for their hard work. Similar to the collaborative effort that followed the Air Force Commission report in 2014, we are working diligently as a total Army to build the strongest ground force possible for this Nation. I would like to offer my sincere appreciation to Acting Secretary Murphy and General Milley for their incredible leadership in this transformative process.    Again, I am honored to be here today representing the men and women of the National Guard and their families who support them. I thank you for your continued support, and I look forward to your questions.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, General Grass.    General Kadavy, thank you for being with us.                  Summary Statement of General Kadavy    General Kadavy. Thank you, Chairman.    Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, distinguished members of the committee, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to represent the nearly 348,000 soldiers of the Army National Guard. And thank you for your continued support that this committee has given our soldiers and Army National Guard families. I look forward to working with you to ensure we sustain that support so vital to our total Army.    I am happy to report to you today that the Army National Guard's relationship with the Army is strong and enduring. We are a valued and integrated part of the United States Army. I am working closely with Acting Secretary of the Army Murphy, General Milley, General Grass, Lieutenant General Talley, and the adjutant generals to strengthen our total Army.    The Army National Guard is regularly employed and, when deployed, goes with the Army's most modern equipment. Soldiers from all three components are continuing to work side-by-side in exercises and operations across the globe, including reassuring allies in Europe and the Pacific.    As we move forward, readiness remains our top concern. Increased training, equipment modernization, continued commitment to our Full-Time Support requirements, and regular rotational utilization will ensure our force's continued readiness.    And when it comes to the Army National Guard, readiness for combat also translates into readiness for missions at home, as we saw last week in Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi. The Army National Guard soldiers are doing extraordinarily outstanding work supporting civil authorities in the aftermath of the recent floods.    I would like to thank the committee for providing us with the programming and resources we need in order to serve the Nation. And, particularly, your generous support for the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account has enabled us to remain a modern and interoperable force. Modernization is always an ongoing effort, and your support has been critical to allowing us to meet that responsibility.    I would also like to thank the members of the National Commission on the Future Army for their hard work. I want to assure this committee that we are working with the Army leadership to assess the Commission's recommendations. We take special interest in recommendations such as multicomponent unit solutions, additional Combat Training Center rotations, and increased flying hours for training, all of which would certainly enhance our readiness.    We are also looking closely at the Commission's recommendation on enhanced support to the Pacific and European combatant commands. The Army National Guard looks forward to being part of the Army's strategy to support these commands.    Additionally, we know there is great interest on certain issues such as the Aviation Restructure Initiative. I assure you that we are looking at all of the Commission's recommendations, and, as part of the Army team, we will present our findings in the near future.    Lastly, with regard to the Commission's determination that a force of 980,000 is minimally sufficient to meet the Nation's challenges, I agree with General Milley that this places us at the edge of being able to meet our current strategy.    I would like to close by saying thank you. Thank you for allowing me to speak here today and for all that you do for our soldiers, civilians, and families of the Army National Guard. I look forward to your questions.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, General Kadavy.    General Neal, thank you.    General Neal. Thank you, Chairman.    Chairman Frelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me here today.    I want to start by publicly thanking the over 105,000 dedicated professional men and women of the Air National Guard for the tremendous job they do every day both at home and overseas. I also want to thank you for your support of the Air National Guard.    When the Air National Guard was created, its primary mission was to train for the next major conflict. The concept of training one weekend a month, 2 weeks a year was based on the original strategic reserve model. Today, the Air Guard is on operational reserve, a force that contributes every day to both the warfight and also provides search capacity for crises.    The men and the women of the Air National Guard have stepped up gallantly to meet the demands of an operational reserve force. As the Acting Director, it is my job to ensure our Guard airmen have the resources and training to do the jobs we ask of them. My priorities are: one, support for the 21st-century Guard airmen; two, readiness; and, three, modernization and recapitalization.    Overall, we must ensure the men and women of the Air National Guard have the support they need as they balance civilian careers, family responsibilities, domestic response needs, and their growing responsibilities to national security. We must make sure our Guard airmen and their families have access to the spiritual, psychological, and medical support they may need. Our Guard airmen need equipment that is capable of integrating seamlessly into the combat environment, and we must ensure they are trained for the full-spectrum operations we expect them to perform.    In closing, I want to thank you for your support of the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account. NGREA is essential for the Air National Guard to the accomplishment of both its Federal and domestic missions. NGREA keeps our combat equipment safe, reliable, and compatible within the combat environment and is the Air Guard's primary source for dual-use equipment needed to respond to domestic emergencies. If it were not for NGREA-funded programs, the Air National Guard would simply not be the force we are today.    Again, thank you for inviting me here today. I look forward to your questions.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, General Neal.    General Talley, thank you for being with us.    General Talley. Chairman Frelinghuysen, Vice Chairman Visclosky, distinguished members of the committee, for now almost 4 years, I have been the Chief of the Army Reserve, Commanding General of the United States Army Reserve Command, and this is my final appearance before your committee, as I will soon return to the civilian sector and retire from America's Army.    I want to personally thank each of you for your steadfast support of our soldiers, civilians, and families. As you know, citizen soldiers are critical enablers, providing enduring operational capability and strategic depth to your Army and to the joint force. Because the Army Reserve comprises the majority of the Army's combat support and sustainment capabilities, the Nation can afford nothing less than a ready, equipped, and operational Army Reserve.    Maintaining the adequate level of readiness to meet existing demands is my primary concern and current challenge. At any given time, between 16,000 and 24,000 Army Reserve soldiers are serving in support of the continental United States and overseas, but we must maintain an additional pool of trained and equipped soldiers annually to support forecasted requirements.    I strongly believe that Full-Time Support is essential for the readiness in the Army Reserve. Full-Time Support provides administrative, medical, training, maintenance, and mobilization support for Army Reserve units and is absolutely necessary for generating and sustaining individual readiness, which is a prerequisite for leader and unit readiness.    Yet the Army Reserve's Full-Time Support Program is currently resourced to only 76 percent of its identified requirements. We must maintain and, if possible, increase Army Reserve Full-Time Support.    One way to increase Full-Time Support is by placing regular Army soldiers back in Reserve units to augment the Active, Guard, and Reserve program in our military technicians. This Title 11 program was tested and implemented back in the nineties and, in my opinion, should be reinstated. Such an effort would promote readiness and help reinforce our Army total force policy across all three components of our great Army.    Another readiness concern is equipment modernization. I am very grateful for the support of this committee and what you have provided through NGREA appropriations, which has accounted for more than 35 percent of Army Reserve equipment procurements between fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2015.    Yet equipment modernization rates for the Army Reserve continue to lag behind the other Army components. For fiscal year 2016, we are scheduled to receive 3.1 percent of the Army's procurement budget, which is significantly less than our pre-9/11 allocations of 6 percent. Continuing to neglect equipment modernization requirements will only exacerbate existing capability gaps between your Army Reserve and the other Army components.    This committee has already heard from Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milleyabout the importance of Army total force policy. I want to reinforce his testimony by emphasizing the positive impact that full implementation of Army total force policy will have on our readiness. Integrating the Active and Reserve components through cross-component assignments and the use of a one-Army school system ensures consistent standards across all of our components.    Finally, the importance of funding the accounts that provide training days for the Army Reserve soldiers cannot be overstated. While the current level of training is sufficient to provide ready forces to meet our identified requirements, the resources are not sufficient to build a force capable of responding to unforeseen contingencies.    Mr. Chairman, the Army Reserve supports the most capable Army the world has ever known. This committee's support is crucial to ensuring that we remain ready to provide support to the total force as we meet current global requirements, respond to national emergencies, and mobilize for contingency operations when our Nation needs us most.    In closing, it has been my distinct honor and pleasure to serve the men and women of the United States Army Reserve. I thank you and the committee for your continued support, and I look forward to your questions. Twice the citizen, and stay Army strong.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Great. Thank you. Good finish. Good finish. Thank you, General Talley.    Member questions. Mr. Calvert, in order of arrival, and then Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Mr. Calvert.    Ms. McCollum and then Ms. Granger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, let's provide the Congresswoman some additional information so that we can satisfy her questions.    Ms. Granger and then Mr. Ryan.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Ms. Granger.    Mr. Ryan, then Judge Carter.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We will, certainly.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Let me turn to the co-chair of the Army Caucus, who raised the flag for the Army this morning with Mr. Ruppersberger, his other co-chair, Judge Carter. And then Mr. Graves.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Judge, you might could define your acronyms that we are putting out here as well, too. I am familiar with most of them.    The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Graves, and then Mr. Womack.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you.    Mr. Womack and then Mr. Coal, the gentleman from Oklahoma.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay.    Mr. Cole and then Mr. Diaz-Balart.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Okay. Thank you.    Would you yield to Mr. Visclosky?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Is that right? Did you want to go now?    Mr. Frelinghuysen. The gentleman from Florida, I apologize, and then Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We have some reservists on your home turf of Cuba, I believe. Right? Don't we have a unit there from Pennsylvania? Didn't want to get you too excited.    Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Before I yield to Ms. Kaptur, I want to get a little more information on the associated units. Of course, our Army chief of staff did a pretty remarkable job this morning of sort of rolling out his billboard. Is this a result of the Commission on the Future of the Army? In other words, is this a step to recognize that that is one of their main recommendations? And is that why it is being set up?    I know obviously we take pride in the integration that we have seen over the last 15 years of the whole Army. What, actually, what legal basis does it have?    General Kadavy. This was one of General Milley's initial initiatives. We have been working through this with the Active Component and with the United States Army Reserve for a number of months prior to the National Commission----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I am all for it. I mean, quite honestly, a year ago everybody was at loggerheads here and all hell was breaking loose in terms of who did what and who is getting what equipment. And I think we have made some progress, and I am highly supportive of it.    But of course when I hear the term pilot, maybe that is the camel's nose under the tent. So we are starting to take a look at this full integration. And just satisfy my curiosity. Does that mean that the Guard and Reserve bring their--I won't say their worn out equipment--to the battle space or does everybody train on what the regular Army, what the regular military is doing?    General Grass. Chairman, if we get it right--and that is why it is a pilot, we want to make sure we get it right. And you think about an Active unit coming to a Guard unit or a Guard unit going to Active, there are authorities we have got to work through, and we can get through there. But think about our young men and women now on a weekend drill where they have access to the most modern equipment.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yeah, I am supportive of it.    Now, as we look at, let's say, our footprint in Afghanistan, 9,800, and I know the reasons, no one ever wants to mention the term 10,000, but there is a view that to put together that force the military has had to draw from a variety of different units, decouple different, should we say, aspects of existing units, I assume regular Army units as well as Guard and Reserve. Is there some degree of that in what we are initiating here?    General Grass. One of the proposals that was rolled out today----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I am not articulating it well, but I think you know what I am talking about.    General Grass. Yes, sir. There would be an exchange of our Active, Guard, and Reserve officers with some of the Active into our units.    Also, when the commissioners briefed us, the first thing they said upfront was there was one Army, a total Army. And this is the first step in the----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I am all for it. I understand the notion of one Army school system. I think I do. But just in terms of the equipment, I think we have been--this committee historically has been very favorable through the NGREA account and I think we will continue to be.    What is the dynamic of, let's say, Humvees and light tactical vehicles and trucks and things that----    General Kadavy. Mr. Chairman, I think I asked General Milley the exact same question. And the intent is there will have to be programming decisions made in fiscal year 2018 and beyond, which is his first program to build. His intent is like-type equipment, like-type capability, and ensuring interoperability.    So I think, yes, those things will happen. One June is initial operating capability, which is starting to coordinate, discuss, build relationships. And then not until 1 October of 2017 full operation capabilities, which is when all those programming decisions we are talking through right now, which will be in the fiscal year 2018 program. But the intent is for them to have the exact same signal equipment, exact same wheeled vehicles. They will be part of that team.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. So you are optimistic. I come from the school of having defended the Future Combat System. And I just want to make sure whatever we are embracing here--I am all for it--that this is actually going to work. I mean, good thing about General Milley's presentation today, he was so emphatic that there would be one Army, that it was sort of let known that if some people didn't like where he was going, they could exit the stage. I like that.    Major General Neal. Mr. Chairman----    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Yes, please jump in, General.    General Neal. So we had this. It was done by Forces Command, starting with Dan Allyn, who was a great commander, and then after him General Milley, and then now General Abrams. And it was called the Training Partnership Program.    And so this isn't anything new. But what is new is that is where they aligned all the various RC units with AC. And it was basically PowerPoint deep, maybe a little bit more than that. Maybe I am not being as generous as I should.    So when we had new FORSCOM commanders came in, and General Milley was trying to work on this when he was the commander, and now he floated up to be the CSA and General Abrams has got this clearly by the handle, the thought process is we have got to make this not a slogan, not a PowerPoint, it has got to be reality. Let's take a step back, let's engage a pilot, and let's get to all the specifics that you are talking about in terms of using the same platform.    So for my case, I got the 100th, go for broke, in Hawaii that is partnering with the 25th Infantry Division. I have got the Quartermaster Airborne Company at Fort Bragg that will plug and play with the 82nd. We will start there. So now what we are doing is rather than starting big and just aligning with everybody, we are really putting meat and potatoes on it, and it is getting strong emphasis from the top. And be reassured, it will work.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I am all for it. But we had a session this morning with the surgeon generals, and we talked about the aspects of health readiness and the inadequacy of the Department of--it is better than it used to be, electronic medical health records. I mean, there will have to be a meshing of a lot of different things in order for this to work and we are obviously encouraged by this step forward. I guess that is the best way to put it.    Do you want to get any last word in, General Grass? Then we are going to go to Ms. Kaptur.    General Grass. Chairman, just one. I think it makes the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account even more important for those units especially that are aligned, that we are going to continue to need that help, because there just won't be enough dollars to modernize and recapitalize.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. We are with you.    Ms. Kaptur, and then Judge Carter, I think, has some additional questions.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You are on television. So go right ahead.    General Neal. You probably heard they already announced--well, I think General Welsh said the same thing earlier in the month. Just that the Air Force Reserve is going to command an Active-Duty wing also.    As far as your IRT, innovation readiness training, what we are doing is two things. One, inadvertently, when we did the DODI, we reported on it, we left out a line that should have said basically that it applies to the Title 32--to the National Guard. We are going back to correct that. We anticipate in the next 4 to 6 weeks we will have that corrected. Therefore, unfunded, when you don't need funds--and I know General Bartman and I have talked about that extensively--when you don't need funding for those projects, it will be a very quick coordination process.    The IRT training that takes right now, what, could take 2 years, because of a lot of the environmental stuff, we are working on a process that will cut that down to 90 days. So, hopefully, with any amount of luck, within the next 60 days, you will have a process on both funded and unfunded projects that will be very quick and you no longer have to wait a year or 2 for all this. So that is what we are trying to do.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Well, we have some excellent substantive witnesses. So we appreciate their input and contribution.    Judge Carter.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Thank you, Judge Carter.    The other bookend of the Army Caucus, the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. You are a giant.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Womack.    Thank you, Mr. Ruppersberger.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Indeed it is.    Ms. McCollum.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Do you want to further comment, clarity, and then Mr. Visclosky has some questions.    General Grass. Congresswoman, if I could add, it is a concern, as Jeff said, and I think he laid it out very well. What we have seen, though, is that predictability is so important when we meet with employers. And I would tell you just personal experience that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is very concerned about it. And when he locks a unit in at 180 days that they are going on a deployment, for anybody to mess with that, they have to come back to him and let him know why they are changing that rotation schedule, whether it is off ramping them because of a mission change. So we have got great commitment from within the Department of Defense.    The other thing that we work very closely with is within the Department of Defense we have the Employer Support to Guard and Reserve Program. We recognize every year 15, and the Secretary of Defense recognizes 15 top employers.    I think the stress comes more in the small business and private business owners. And I think in looking to the future, if there is a way we could help them in some way when we do hit a small town fairly heavy, because that is where it occurs.    For the Army Guard and the Air Guard right now, our numbers, of course, on the Army Guard probably the lowest it has been in 15 years for deployments. So if we have the predictability and we have a soldier who has an issue with employment, we can work around that now to help them in some cases.    General Kadavy. If I could just add a couple things, Congresswoman. Part of the reason why the associated unit is a pilot project is because these are one of the things that we need to understand when enough training and readiness starts to impact families and employers. So that is one of the things we will study.    We are sending almost 6,000 soldiers to Europe to support ERI, and we are going to ask their employers and our soldiers and their families these exact same questions. Is a 29-day annual training to do an overseas deployment, what is the impact? So we are interested in that.    We continue to communicate with our soldiers and with our leaders in the States. Adjutant generals have a very big play in it. So far they have told us that while there is strain, it isn't at a breaking point.    And the last indicator I would say that I keep an eye on is our retention numbers. And thus far it isn't our retention that is our issue if we will make end strength or not. We are retaining well beyond our expected rates.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. Mr. Visclosky.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. I should have been aware of my surroundings. I apologize.    Mr. Frelinghuysen. On that very positive note, I would like to thank General Grass, wish you God speed, General Talley, for both of your years of incredible dedicated service to our Nation. And to General Neal and Kadavy, thank you very much for being here. We appreciate all you do. And please thank the men and women who stand behind you who do the work of freedom at home and abroad.    We stand adjourned. Thank you.
