    Ms. Sinema. Thank you, Chairman Fitzpatrick, and Ranking Member Lynch. Arizona's top export market is Mexico, and cross-border trade is essential to our economy. Despite its importance to Arizona's economy, cross-border trade is often used to facilitate international money laundering. For the past 20 years, official figures put Mexican exports to America well above American imports from Mexico. According to Global Financial Integrity, the discrepancy can be attributed to Mexican groups using trade-based money laundering to bring dollars into Mexico.    We need to find ways to stop trade-based money laundering, while promoting the efficient and cost-effective movement of goods and services across borders. Given the volume and complexity of trade-based money laundering, how can we do more to counter the misuse of international commerce and the threat it poses to our national security? How can we address this national security threat without limiting access to banking services for legitimate enterprises in border States like mine? I look forward to hearing more from our witnesses today about how we can better combat international money laundering without creating costly red tape and inhibit commercial trade flows.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
