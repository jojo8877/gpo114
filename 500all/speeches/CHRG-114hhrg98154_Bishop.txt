    Mr. Bishop. Thank you very much.    And let me once again welcome the panel.    Dr. Woteki, Dr. Jacobs-Young, I was very pleased to see that the President's budget for fiscal year 2016 included an investment of $113.7 million for the new Agricultural Research Service Poultry Laboratory in Athens, Georgia, and it continues to be the Department's number one ARS priority again this year.    As you may or may not know, I am the cochair of the Congressional Chicken Caucus, that Georgia is the number one producer and exporter of poultry products in the Nation.    So can you give us a quick update on the current status of the Athens lab, what has been obligated thus far for the project, including how much has been obligated thus far, and what are the projected total costs, and when you expect the project to be completed.    Mr. Bishop. Thank you.    As you know, we have another ARS facility in Georgia, which just happens to be in my district in Byron, Georgia. The ARS Byron facility has been one of ARS's most successful areas of public-private partnership in agriculture and has been invaluable in the growth and expansion not only just of the pecan industry, but peaches and other fruits and vegetables, which are critical in the southeast.    Unfortunately, the Byron facility has really seen better days and it is now just sort of limping along. And, frankly, it is in somewhat of a state of disrepair. Can you share with us ARS's plans for the Byron facility.    And given the presence of our 1890 Fort Valley State University, which is almost next door, I think that there could be numerous opportunities for ARS and NIFA to work together to improve and expand the capacity of the Byron ARS facility.    That facility has the world's greatest bank of pecan plants anywhere in the world, and it is a shame for it not to be maximized. Georgia, of course, leads the country in pecans, also. And, of course, we are beginning to export tremendous amounts of that.    Can you talk about that just briefly.    Mr. Bishop. Very quickly, I notice that the fiscal year 2016 budget proposes a decrease of $2.8 million for two research projects that are currently being performed in Athens: molecular approaches for the characterization of food-borne pathogens and poultry and pre-harvest interventions for application during poultry production to reduce food-borne bacterial pathogens.    Can you share with us the current status of these two projects and if there are sufficient funds available in fiscal year 2015 to complete them. Are the reductions that are proposed essentially in those two projects?    Mr. Bishop. In Athens?    Mr. Bishop. Thank you.
