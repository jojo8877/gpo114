    Dr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate each of you for joining us today.    Mr. Mayer and Mr. Cline, the Forest Service manual states that Secretary's rules and regulations do not apply to the administration of outstanding rights. So, with that being said, it appears to me, at least, that the Forest Service attempt to apply NEPA to private mineral rights in the Allegheny National Forest is not only a violation of state and Federal law, but even a violation of their own policy. Would you agree with that?    Dr. Hice. So, is it your opinion that the Forest Service staff was aware of this when drafting the regulations that led to the ban on oil and gas leasing in the Allegheny?    Dr. Hice. Let me keep going with this thought, and I appreciate your answer.    Mr. Cline, do you have anything to add?    Dr. Hice. So, do you believe that employees at the Forest Service purposely ignored their operating manual?    Dr. Hice. OK. Mr. Mayer?    Dr. Hice. Is this, in both of your opinions, a rogue behavior of a single occurrence, or is this symptomatic of a larger problem?    Dr. Hice. OK. Mr. Cline?    Dr. Hice. All right. So, this is symptomatic of a larger problem, right?    Mr. Casamassa, your response?    Dr. Hice. All right. Let me interrupt you, if I can, because I have a couple other questions for you. But you are not answering the issue of ignoring your own policy, and that is what is at stake here.    Let me ask you this. Roughly how much money has all the litigation tied to regulating private mineral estate in Allegheny cost the American taxpayer since 2007?    Dr. Hice. OK. I would appreciate that greatly.    Chairman, I see my time is running out, but I thank you, and I yield back.
