    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Administrator Fugate, thank you for your presence here this morning, and thank you for your service to the people of Florida over so many years. We remember you very fondly and we miss you at times, so thank you very much.    I represent south Florida where a large portion of my district lives on or near the coast. One of the constant worries I hear from my constituents back home, especially in the Florida Keys, is the need to reform the National Flood Insurance Program. I am a cosponsor of the Flood Insurance Premium Parody Act, a bill which would extend the recent NFIP reforms to business properties and owner-occupied second homes. And I feel it is critical these properties receive the same relief already provided to residential properties and single-family homes afforded to them under the Biggert-Waters Act of 2012.    Can you share your thoughts on what best can be done to provide affordable flood insurance for my constituents? Do you feel that we should apply to commercial properties and second homes the same formula for yearly rate increases received by residential properties?    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you, Mr. Fugate.    And the State of Florida has learned a lot since 1992 and has changed a lot. Do you feel that the State is adequately prepared today for a potential storm? You referred to one earlier, a Great Miami Storm. Do you feel that we have done enough, from your perspective, to prepare and to mitigate potential damages?    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
