    Mr. Sires. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for being here. This is a very important issue for empowering women in many of these countries. I was just wondering, when you talk about this stigma that in some of these countries have, women using the Internet, and getting good at it, would you call it jealousy, just from the male role in some of these countries, or what is actually the stigma that you are talking about? Anyone?    Mr. Sires. Ms. Davis.    Mr. Sires. Yes. Ms. Jorge.    Mr. Sires. Well, thank you. I always get jealous in my office when I have a staffer come in and teaches me how to work my computer, or work my phone. And to me, that is a jealousy factor that is not just in my office, but I think in some of these countries also, when they see a woman being so good at some of these gadgets. But I thank you very much for being here, and thank you for all of your information that you have given us. Thank you.    Mr. Sires. Former prosecutor from Florida.
