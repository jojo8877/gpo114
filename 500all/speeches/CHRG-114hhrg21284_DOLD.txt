    Mr. DOLD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I certainly want to thank all of our witnesses for coming and for your testimony today. And really the topic that we are talking about, I am going to agree with Mr. Crowley, in talking about protecting the safety net, that is a goal that we all share. And, frankly, when we look at the abuse, when we look at the fraud that happens out there, the people that it hurts the most are the folks that need the safety net the most. And ultimately, I think what we want is we want confidence, we want confidence in the system, that it is going to work, that the Government is actually out there working. And when we have the, what we are looking at is billions of dollars in terms of just payments, improper payments paid out, Mr. Smith was talking about, it is about 10 percent, 9.2 percent for SSI and 11.6 percent for UI. He is talking about a McDonalds on this thing. I would talk about it as if you are driving a car and you know, 1 in 10 doesn't work or is recalled, we are going to have a big problem. And so I recognize that some of these overpayments or mispayments can be rectified. My hope is, is that we do, that we root out this waste, fraud, and abuse. What I am really looking for from each and every one of you, from your subject matter expertise, is what can we do? We want to come up with solutions to these problems so that this number gets as close to zero as possible, so that we can end waste, fraud, and abuse.    And, certainly, Ms. Rohlman, your idea about trying to make sure that the government is accepting the private sector data in a way that it is easy for them to do it makes all the sense in the world. Many of you who were here to listen to the first panel that had a number of pieces of legislation. Ms. Vallas, you talked a little bit about some concerns that you had. But I would be interested from all of you, in terms of the five different pieces of legislation, from permanently ending receipt by prisoners or the PERP Act, The Furloughed Federal Employee Double Dip Elimination Act, the School Attendance Improves Lives Act, the Flexibility to Promote Reemployment Act, and the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons. Of these, you know, which of these pieces of legislation has merit in your eyes that we should be really trying to focus and move forward? Because, today, if we come and you talk and we don't have an action item going forward about how to really solve these problems in a bipartisan way, then it was really more of a waste of time. And that is not what we are looking to do. We need to solve some problems.    Mr. O'Carroll, we can start with you? Are there some merit in some of the pieces of legislation that you look at? Can you pick your top two or three that you think may be worthy of moving forward?    Mr. DOLD. Okay. Mr. Bertoni.    Mr. DOLD. Thank you. Mr. Eysink.    Mr. DOLD. Mr. Chairman, I know I am out of time but I just don't want to let----    Mr. DOLD. Ms. Vallas.    Mr. DOLD. I appreciate it. I thank you all for your testimony and appreciate it and look forward to working with you all. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
