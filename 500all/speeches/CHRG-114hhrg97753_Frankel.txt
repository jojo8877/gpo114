    Ms. Frankel. That is all right. Mr. Cicilline can go ahead of me any time.    Thank you, Madam Chair, for this hearing. I will be short just to--as the chairlady knows, my son served in the United States Marines in Afghanistan. He also went back to Afghanistan as a member of USAID. So I have a great deal of interest in hearing what you have to say today. And I yield back.
