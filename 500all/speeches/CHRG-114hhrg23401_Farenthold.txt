    Mr. Farenthold. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    And I wanted to start out with Ms. Goodwin from Microsoft. We've talked a little bit about, today, about how some of this software is available from countries that aren't a party to our agreement. I know Microsoft is active in fighting software piracy as well. Even in the domestic, international stuff that we're seeking to regulate, software is pretty portable and pretty easy to pirate. Do you think there's a practical way we can actually put export control on software against, obviously, a hacker who would be typically unethical to begin with, or a state actor that's hostile to us? I imagine y'all struggle pretty hard from keeping Microsoft Word from getting pirated?    Mr. Farenthold. Let me ask you another question. It seems like we're focusing on regulating the tools rather than the people. I mean, I think that kind of goes along the--you know, not just even the developers, but the folks that are using it. I mean, where do you--where do you see--do you think that's a better idea, and do you think that's more doable?    Mr. Farenthold. Thank you very much.    And let's talk to, I guess, Ms. Ganzer from the State Department. As y'all's team was getting ready for the negotiations, did y'all go out and talk to companies like Microsoft or Symantec or VMware? What was your engagement with the industry?    Mr. Farenthold. Kevin, do you want to--Mr. Wolf, you want to take that one?    Mr. Farenthold. Did it come as a surprise to you that we got so many negative comments?    Mr. Farenthold. Would you agree with that, Ms. Ganzer?    Mr. Farenthold. And were you surprised with the comment, the number of comments as well or the----    Mr. Farenthold. I see my time has expired.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
