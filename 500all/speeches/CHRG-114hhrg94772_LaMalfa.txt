    Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this. This is also very critical in my northeast California district that borders Nevada and Mr. Amodei's district, where the sage grouse, or otherwise known as sage hen, is quite an issue. The bi-state situation was a good sign.    The problem is, with the threat of any kind of list, some are referring to it as a good pressure. But what we have are Federal agencies that are unable to keep up with the management of their lands, whether it is BLM or the Forest Service. So, we have this proliferation of juniper, big-time, in our area here, and a listing just takes options off the table. I imagine the juniper eradication is going much more slowly because we are pussy-footing around. There might be sage hen habitat out there that is a problem, but we don't nearly keep up with the juniper or--Mr. Zinke mentioned predators, too. That is a bigger consideration we ought to be looking at. Maybe not as much in my area as his, but--all the options.    What are the things that you would actually do to really improve the situation? We move so slowly with EISs and studying and talking, and all this, when it is the farmers, the ranchers, it is the people that live in the area that actually know and understand what it takes, where the species is, what it would take to help make it a little better, you know?    I mean the regulation, the threat of listing, has gotten everybody's attention. Farmers and ranchers are willing. These landowners, the ones that are adjacent to the Federal lands, they are willing to do things. Maybe in the past there were some stiff-necked folks, I certainly get that. But they are willing to step forward and do it.    When we have these listings--as Mr. McClintock mentioned with the Yosemite toad, yellow-legged frog and all that, 2 million acres are--who knows? By the time they are done implementing their plan, their proposal, it will probably mean people can do less things in the area to manage timber, to manage the lands, to do things that would dovetail well with the species and its recovery. It will just be off limits, instead. The whole forest will burn. In the case we are talking about here, more and more juniper grows because we are afraid we might disturb a nesting grouse, instead of doing things that are going to improve it.    It is a big frustration. So, I don't think any more pressure to go through with a listing, especially since so many listings these days come from a deal cut by government with a bunch of environmental groups that have a long Christmas wish list of species they want to list, and there is no time to go through all those processes, because they take so long, so they get sued, they just cut a deal, list them anyway. That is the great frustration I see out in districts like mine and neighboring ones.    So, Ms. Clarke, again, up there in Utah, have you seen that the sage grouse are actually using the treated areas that the state is creating? Is it something----    Mr. LaMalfa. Because you have had the ability to move a little more quickly and efficiently in getting these areas set up.    Mr. LaMalfa. So, are the Federal folks, do you feel like they are just hand-tied to be able to move things as quickly as--efficiently as----    Mr. LaMalfa. So they want to do it, but they don't----    Mr. LaMalfa. They don't have the ability. Washington is not giving them the ability to do that by----    Mr. LaMalfa. Yes, OK. That has to be highly frustrating for everybody wanting to do that.    Mr. Miller, in Idaho--coming back to the wildfire piece there--I imagine you have a pretty big problem with that, as well. What success is the state of Idaho having on addressing wildfire and lessening that?    Mr. LaMalfa. Now, as we are running out of time, how is this interfacing with Federal lands, or Federal agency cooperation, or lack of? How is that going?    Mr. LaMalfa. The Chairman is using some timber up there. I thank you.    Mr. LaMalfa . Thank you, gentleman from Colorado.    The gentleman from Idaho.    Mr. LaMalfa. All right. Thank you, gentleman from Idaho. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the testimony of the Western Governors' Association.    Mr. LaMalfa. OK.    Prepared Statement of James D. Ogsbury, Executive Director, Western                          Governors' Association    Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to submit written testimony on behalf of the Western Governors' Association (WGA) in connection with the oversight hearing on ``Empowering State Management of Greater Sage-Grouse.'' My name is James D. Ogsbury and I am WGA's Executive Director. WGA is an independent, non-partisan organization representing the Governors of 19 western states and 3 U.S.-flag islands.    Western Governors support implementation of reasonable management efforts to conserve species and preclude the need to list species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Western states proactively work on species conservation and possess knowledge and experience to manage species within the region. This is particularly true with the greater sage-grouse, a bird found in 11 western states--California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming--that is a candidate for listing under the ESA.    All 11 greater sage-grouse states have developed state conservation plans for the bird and invested millions of dollars in conservation and research. Western Governors appreciate this forum for states to highlight what has been accomplished through state leadership of greater sage-grouse management and to explain why states should continue in this leadership role going forward.    WGA has released an annual report of the voluntary conservation measures that states and local governments have implemented for greater sage-grouse since 2011. Our fourth annual report (http://westgov.org/images/dmdocuments/2014_WGA_ Sage_Grouse_Inventory_Final_lo_res.pdf) includes conservation efforts of Federal agencies, conservation districts, industry and nonprofits, as well as states. The report's appendix (http://westgov.org/images/dmdocuments/2014_WGA_Sage_ Grouse_Appendix_lo-res.pdf) is a compilation of all state and local government efforts reported over the last 4 years.    I commend your attention to the following highlights from the 2014 report:    <bullet> Colorado, Nevada, North Dakota and South Dakota either             completed or updated state plans for sage-grouse             conservation during 2014.    <bullet> Montana Gov. Steve Bullock issued an Executive Order in             2014 establishing a statewide greater sage-grouse habitat             conservation program and requiring state agency compliance.    <bullet> Colorado, Idaho and Montana have collectively protected             nearly 350,000 acres of greater sage-grouse habitat through             purchase or conservation easements.    <bullet> Idaho wildlife and land agencies have spent $4 million             improving and restoring habitat.    <bullet> Utah has completed nearly 85 percent of a 560,000-acre             project to ameliorate conifer encroachment in sage-grouse             management areas.    <bullet> Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and Idaho Gov. C.L. ``Butch''             Otter are directing almost $6 million toward greater sage-            grouse conservation, and Wyoming's legislature awarded             approximately $2 million for additional greater sage-grouse             research.    Western Governors helped create a state-Federal Sage-Grouse Task Force in 2011 that has fostered a dialog between states and Federal land management agencies regarding management strategies, conservation tools and related policies. At task force meetings, states have clearly stated that, while conservation plans may differ from one state to another to reflect primary threats to greater sage-grouse and institutional dynamics, taken collectively the plans provide the comprehensive structure needed to conserve greater sage-grouse and their habitat. The Federal agencies on the task force have acknowledged that a diverse but cohesive approach that achieves the desired conservation outcomes can, if structured carefully, meet the requirements of ESA for a ``not warranted'' decision.    Conservation easements are one mechanism states are using to protect habitat on private lands. The permanency and durability of easements render them a vital part of successful sage-grouse conservation. Private landowners are central to voluntary conservation efforts, and their contributions should be given full consideration by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in determining whether to list the greater sage-grouse under the ESA. A great amount of land is being protected at a substantial cost. In Colorado, for example, over 80,600 acres of greater sage-grouse habitat has been protected by Colorado Parks and Wildlife through either fee title purchase or conservation easements at a cost of approximately $52.8 million. The states' significant contribution to permanent conservation is in addition to parallel work being performed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) through its Sage Grouse Initiative on private lands. NRCS has put more than 450,000 acres of conservation easements into place in the last 5 years. NRCS invested $165 million, with another $85 million in partner match, for a total conservation easement investment of $250 million.    State conservation leadership also comes in the form of people power. Montana, South Dakota and Colorado hired staff that cooperate with the Natural Resources Conservation Service's Sage Grouse Initiative to promote private land conservation. Nevada hired a new rangeland health program coordinator to assist landowners with rangeland health assessments and monitoring.    Moving from planning to implementation, states have invested heavily in habitat improvements beneficial to greater sage-grouse and other species dependent on sagebrush habitat. They have spent millions on improving riparian habitat, restoring habitat burned by wildfires, and removing invasive conifer trees that crowd out sagebrush.    Investments also extend to research and education. The legislatures in Idaho and Wyoming contributed $2.5 million toward research and lek monitoring. Utah is studying lek use after juniper removal and Colorado has a research unit working on multiple research efforts.    Innovative management tools are also being utilized by states to bolster sage-grouse habitat. Nevada's Sagebrush Ecosystem Council adopted the Nevada Conservation Credit System to offset impacts from human-caused disturbances through enhancements and protections that result in a net benefit for greater sage-grouse habitat. Extensive fence-marking and fence-removal work has been performed by states and their partners, reducing collision risk and eliminating perches for predators.    A major threat to greater sage-grouse is rangeland fire. Burned sagebrush areas take decades to recover. Utah updated its conservation plan to address wildfire and Nevada created a Wildland Fire Protection Program to provide improved access to firefighters and implement pre-suppression activities. Idaho increased its number of Rangeland Fire Protection Associations from three to five. These associations facilitate coordination between public and private partners to improve initial attack on wildfires, with faster response times translating into reductions in acres burned.    All of this is only what states have accomplished through the end of 2014; much more is planned for 2015 and beyond:    <bullet> Montana Gov. Steve Bullock recently signed into law the             Montana Greater Sage Grouse Stewardship Act. The bill             establishes an oversight team and calls for conservation             easements and a conservation fund. The state is hiring five             new employees to oversee its sage grouse program.    <bullet> Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval requested legislative approval             in his FY15-17 biennial budget for over $5.1 million for             Sagebrush Ecosystem Program efforts, including a commitment             of $1 million each year for critical habitat protection and             restoration projects in sage-grouse management areas.    <bullet> Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife is working with             the FWS and agricultural and livestock operators to develop             a Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA)             for greater sage-grouse.    <bullet> Idaho is conducting numerous research projects and adding             another Rangeland Fire Protection Association.    <bullet> North Dakota will complete a fully funded cooperative             monitoring project and provide recommendations on best             management practices for grazing livestock in greater sage-            grouse habitat.    The success of collaborative, locally led conservation is illustrated by the recent determination that the bi-state distinct population segment of greater sage-grouse in California and Nevada does not require protection under the ESA. Interior observed that a key factor in the decision not to list the bird was the development of the Bi-State Action Plan, a conservation plan developed by partners in the Bi-State Local Area Working Group over the past 15 years and secured with $45 million in funding. Western Governors encourage support for similar efforts throughout the sage-grouse range.    As captured in WGA's 2014 Sage-Grouse Inventory report, the efforts described here represent just one piece of the greater sage-grouse conservation puzzle. Over 60 percent of greater sage-grouse habitat is on Federal lands. Federal agencies, as partners, should do their share by proactively addressing habitat needs such as invasive species control, rangeland fire preparedness, and site restoration and rehabilitation. Implementing such measures allows Federal agencies and others to better protect the landscape under a range of circumstances and conditions.    This is a significant point. The states have taken substantial actions, at significant cost, to protect and enhance greater sage-grouse habitat. These actions, however, affect only that portion of the greater sage-grouse's habitat over which states have authority. States cannot compel the Federal Government to protect and enhance habitat on federally owned lands. That is a management decision left to the Federal Government.    It is important to note that the states view several areas of Federal action--or lack of action--as counterproductive to the protection of greater sage-grouse habitat. For example, Western Governors have been very concerned that the budgetary tactic of ``fire borrowing'' redirects funding from activities that would otherwise mitigate fire hazards in greater sage-grouse habitat, among other areas. Western states are also concerned about the insufficiency of Federal action to combat invasive species. Invasives can have a dramatic impact on sage-grouse habitat and the severity of fire in rangeland areas. The Federal Government has a responsibility to: properly maintain Federal lands; protect and enhance forest health; minimize the severity of catastrophic wildfire; and provide a vibrant habitat for the greater sage-grouse and other important species.    FWS should fully recognize the voluntary conservation efforts of states together with local governments, Federal agencies, conservation districts, private landowners, industry and nonprofits. These efforts, if allowed to run their course, will provide greater sage-grouse with the necessary habitat to live and thrive.    Thank you for the opportunity to provide written testimony. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the content of these remarks or require further information.                                 ______                                     Mr. LaMalfa. I will just have one last bit of questions here, and I think that will be it for today.    So, Mr. Miller, listening to Mr. Labrador and your exchange, do you really need the Federal Government in partnership with you at all?    Mr. LaMalfa. I mean, really. Do you really need the help? If it was completely put back to your state, do you think you would have a more successful program of recovery and maintenance of sage grouse, as well as other species?    Mr. LaMalfa. Of course. They have the jurisdiction; but if they turned it over to you, do you think you would see a better result? ``Listen, hey, we are going to contract with you. You manage it for us, we will just stay in Washington.'' What do you think the result would be?    Mr. LaMalfa. I mean, obviously, you would have to set aside NEPA and other types of things; but just in the realm of what is good for the creature.    Mr. LaMalfa. OK, thank you.    So, Mr. Arnett, during today's hearing, I have heard you kind of take a position that is more defending of the Federal role, where the others on the panel have kind of expressed--you know, Ms. Clarke, Mr. Miller--that they have had more success at the local level.    So, what looks to me is like a much slower, much more difficult process to get through and even--as was testified; that once the Federal Government makes a law, makes a decision on it, it is much, much harder to wade through that in order to try and tweak that, or go in a different direction. How do you defend this current process, versus some of the success stories we have heard here today with local state-level input and control?    Mr. LaMalfa. Managed being a pretty loosely used term from----    Mr. LaMalfa. It is the year 2015. Where have these strategies been for the last 30 or 40 years?    Mr. LaMalfa. OK.    Mr. LaMalfa. It is a moving target for the states, though, too. It is a moving target for the private landowners that have to live next to these areas. So, well, thank you.    Mr. Swartout, I will finish up with you here. Do you think a listing of the sage grouse under the ESA would have helped or hindered the establishment of sage grouse conservation easements?    Mr. LaMalfa. How about an actual listing, though?    Mr. LaMalfa. What is the impact you have seen with already-listed Gunnison sage grouse, on willingness of landowners to enter into the conservation agreements now?    Mr. LaMalfa. So it hasn't broken because of a previous momentum and engagement and strategy to do so, but it has put a damper on it, you would say.    Mr. LaMalfa. A little more difficult. OK. Well, I appreciate it.    To everybody on our panel here today, thank you for your travel, for your valuable testimony. We do appreciate what it takes to get here and be part of this.    Since there are no other members of the committee left, I will say there might be additional questions that committee members may submit, and we would ask you to respond to those in writing. Under Committee Rule 4(h), the hearing record will be held open for 10 business days after these responses.    So, if there is no further business, without objection this committee is adjourned.
