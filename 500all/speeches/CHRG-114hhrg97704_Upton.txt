    Mr. Upton. Good morning. We continue our examination of the role biotechnology plays in our Nation's farms and in our food supply. Our food, as we know, is literally our lifeline. It is important for the public to be engaged. It is the job of this subcommittee to establish a record based on the facts and the science so we ultimately pass legislation that is in the best interest of our constituents and our economy.    At the hearing that we held in December of last year and in other venues since then, the FDA has been clear that the premarket consultation process currently in place to review food produced from genetically engineered crops is rigorous and the agency has no basis for questioning its safety. The WHO and every other legitimate health and scientific body that has examined this evidence has echoed the FDA's findings. Nonetheless, there are a number of state-specific labeling requirements in various stages of consideration that are inconsistent, potentially confusing to consumers, would increase food costs that cast out over the safety of biotechnology.    Mr. Pompeo and Butterfield have been working tirelessly on a bipartisan basis in putting together a clear, understandable national framework that maintains FDA'S current review process, codifies Federal labeling standards and related requirements, establishes a certification process that the Department of Agriculture, consistent with current organic program, for the labeling of products as being produced or developed without the use of genetic engineering.    The draft amendment to H.R. 1599 circulated before this hearing is another step in the right direction, and I commend the Ag Committee for working with us to get the bill through the House to ensure consumers will have a clear, concise, and consistent system to assist in their food choices. I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Pompeo.
