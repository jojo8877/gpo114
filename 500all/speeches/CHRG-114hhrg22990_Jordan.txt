    Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having this hearing and for our witnesses and the chairman for his work in this area, extensive work in this area.    Mr. Concannon, how much money is spent annually on the food stamp program both--well, how much is spent annually?    Mr. Jordan. Seventy-five billion dollars. You know what it was 8 years ago?    Mr. Jordan. The chart I am looking at says it was less than half of that.    Mr. Jordan. Thirty-seven ----    Mr. Jordan. A lot of people would say we were in a recession in '07 and '08. I am looking at that, so 2008--well, even if you go 2009, it is 50 percent greater, more than 50 percent greater. It was $53 billion just a few years ago.    How many people are getting this benefit today?    Mr. Jordan. And do you know how many of that 44.3 million are able-bodied adults?    Mr. Jordan. So half ----    Mr. Jordan. So over 4 million?    Mr. Jordan. Okay. And, Ms. Mayhew, my understanding is you have taken that population you just talked about, at least the ones who live in the State of Maine, and you have put back in place a work requirement for able-bodied adults, able-bodied adults, I assume, with no dependents, is that accurate?    Mr. Jordan. Okay. And what has been your experience with that program?    Mr. Jordan. Exactly the same requirements that were working fine back then ----    Mr. Jordan. Twenty hours a week, excuse me. That is right.    Mr. Jordan. Got you.    Ms. Mayhew.--or volunteering one hour a day.    Mr. Jordan. So some options. All right. And what happened when you did that?    Mr. Jordan. Hold on one second. Back up a second. What was the number in Maine when you--able-bodied adults 18 to 49 in the program? What was that number?    Mr. Jordan. Fifteen thousand. What is the number--and you have implemented this program now several months?    Mr. Jordan. Okay. So a year-and-a-half. And what have you seen happen? Is it 12,000 you said?    Mr. Jordan. So they are no longer in the program?    Mr. Jordan. No, I am asking, is that--I would view that as a good thing. My guess is what happened is they said, you know what, if I got to do all this job training, job requirement, da, da, da, why don't I just get a job?    Mr. Jordan. Imagine that.    Mr. Jordan. Right. And that is a good thing, wouldn't you say?    Mr. Jordan. Yes.    Mr. Jordan. So you followed them up?    Ms. Mayhew.--to implementing--yes, we did.    Mr. Jordan. And, Ms. Dean, is that not a good thing?    Mr. Jordan. But they did get a job so that is a good thing and they are no longer living off the taxpayer ----    Mr. Jordan. Ms. Mayhew, what is that number?    Mr. Jordan. She is saying that there is some of that 12,000 who are no longer getting food stamps who didn't get a job. Do you know what that number is?    Mr. Jordan. But the point is they can still get food stamps if they are willing to do the three options you gave them, correct?    Mr. Jordan. Okay. Ms. Dean, how is that negative?    Mr. Jordan. In--okay.    Ms. Dean.--part- to full-time jobs available.    Mr. Jordan. I am asking you about Maine. I am asking you about Maine because Maine has done it. That is the one experiment we have that I think is working win-win-win. Either they can do the job training, which is going to help them long-term to stay on food stamps or they can do what most people did in Maine and say, you know what, I don't want to do that. I am just going to get a real job, right? And if they decide to opt out and can't get a job, they can always come back and go to one of those three options. So tell me what is negative about that. That seems to be helping that individual who was in the system get to a better position in life, and just as importantly, help treat taxpayers with the respect they deserve so someone is not living off their tax dollars who is able-bodied. Why is that wrong?    Mr. Jordan. I am talking about the State of Maine.    Mr. Jordan. Well, wait, wait, wait ----    Mr. Jordan. We just heard that this was not about people with--there is a big difference between able-bodied individuals between 18 and 49 with no dependents and someone with a disability and someone with children and some who is a senior. There is a big difference. If I could, Mr. Chairman, one last question.    What is the number today, Ms. Mayhew, that is in that category in Maine? What is the number? It was 12,000. What is the number today?    Mr. Jordan. Less than what?    Mr. Jordan. That is unbelievable. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
