    Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Welcome to all. And the chairman mentioned the food that we eat and that we feed our children and grandchildren. I want to add one category to that, what we feed our pets. And we are concerned about that aspect also.    I do appreciate Mr. Pompeo and the assistance they have given us as we look at pet food labeling. And the chairman also mentioned that we have had these products in the marketplace for decades. I would say we are talking about over 100 years. Go back and look at what farmers did. And they would breed cattle to get the best traits. Look at the work that George Washington Carver did in his 40 years of teaching and research at Tuskegee, looking for ways to improve the soil, looking at different varietals of peanut and sweet potatoes and improving the health of individuals in the south.    Genetically modified foods are components that are indeed with us, and it is because of them that we have greater yields per acre; we have more varieties, and that our farmers markets that I visit every single weekend are full of beautiful products that encourage people to access these fresh foods and bring them into their homes and kitchens.    With that, I thank all for their work. I yield back.
