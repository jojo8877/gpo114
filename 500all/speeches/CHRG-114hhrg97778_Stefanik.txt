    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to start off with a broad question to Mr. Batkins. Do you believe there is a connection between the $100 billion in additional annual regulatory costs imposed by this administration and the stagnation facing this nation's wages?    Ms. Stefanik. My follow up question is last month I chaired a hearing hosted by the Republican Policy Committee on Millennials in the Workforce. I am chairing the Millennial Task Force.    One of the themes is the importance of this empowerment economy, so companies like Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, that provide greater flexibility.    When I visit college campuses in my district, one of the professions that I hear most often from students is they want to be entrepreneurs, but witness after witness at these millennial hearings raised the challenges of regulatory overreach as to starting their business or growing their careers.    Can you identify certain pending DOL regulations that you believe pose the greatest threat to this empowerment economy?    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you. Mr. Beebe, I grew up in my family's small business, which is a plywood wholesale company. We have less than 20 employees. One of our greatest challenges is dealing with regulations.    Since you are a small business owner yourself, I wanted to ask you if there are specific instances where regulations have either forced you to delay important projects or have not allowed you to hire additional employees.    Ms. Stefanik. Thank you very much. I yield back.
