    Mr. Gibson. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.    Appreciate the panelists being here today.    First, a question about Lieutenant Nadiya Savchenko. I am interested in what we know about her current health and about release.    General Breedlove. Congressman, we don't know as much as we would like to know. What we do hear is that she is well cared for. It is not an arduous affair. But that is clearly what we are being told. We have no indications one way or the other.    And this is a strong point of constant contact as Ukraine negotiates forward.    Mr. Gibson. I am following that situation very closely and appreciate your attention to that as well.    Question now is really more one of a whole-of-government. So Ms. Wormuth, I am interested in your insights with regard to your actions in the interagency. And specifically here I am asking about the status of political-military cohesion and unity within Ukraine and across Ukraine, and the status of civil-military relations inside Ukraine. Because really the focus, the thrust of the question is: How are we doing as far as helping Ukraine strengthen itself?    Mr. Gibson. So then, more specifically, what I am concerned about is certainly the reports that I read and from my constituents. I have strong Ukrainian-American communities in upstate New York, Kerhonkson and other places, and so I often hear of, at times, different approaches in different parts of Ukraine.    So now, I have a geographic question, and how are we interacting that maybe helps strengthen and unifying some of the geographic differences of opinion as it relates to political-military. And then, of course, that question is still on the table: Do you have any concerns on the civil-military relations inside Ukraine?    Mr. Gibson. That is an encouraging report. And I will continue to watch very closely. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.    The Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Larsen.
