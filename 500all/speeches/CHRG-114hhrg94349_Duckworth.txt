    Ms. Duckworth. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I would like to turn the discussion toward the concept of data minimization and data reduction as a security measure.    Mr. Bejtlich, could you speak a bit to this principle? Do you think that as a practice, if businesses adopted data minimization, would this type of security measure be more effective in mitigating the damage from a breach?    Ms. Duckworth. Can you speak a bit to the role of encryption in protecting highly sensitive data, especially on business and agency networks? This committee's job is to provide oversight of business and government agencies. Can you speak a bit to encryption?    I also sit on Armed Services and am looking at some of their encryption challenges, especially with significant numbers of subcontractors, sub-subcontractors and the like.    Ms. Duckworth. Following this train of thought, I would like to look at data segmentation. We have talked about data minimization and encryption. Let us talk about data segmentation.    Mr. Johnson, can you talk about this as a practice in your industry, if it is considered a best practice, and what would be happening if more businesses chose to do data segmentation?    Ms. Duckworth. Mr. Bejtlich, could you speak a bit to the cooperation between the Chinese government and their business sector in conducting cyber espionage? Specifically, I am thinking of the case where there were Chinese companies that infiltrated Lockheed Martin, stole a lot of data and shared that data with the Chinese government which then resulted in their upgrading their fifth generation fighter jets.    Can you talk a bit about that partnership that seems to be occurring?    Ms. Duckworth. Thank you.
