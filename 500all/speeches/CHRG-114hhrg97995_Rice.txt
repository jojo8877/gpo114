    Ms. Rice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    This is for Ms. Gerton. During the DoL's Employment Workshops, are private sector employers brought in to do mock interviews, and if so, are you getting feedback to the servicemembers on their interview performance? I mean is there any aspect of private sector involvement?    Ms. Rice. Thank you. I yield back my time. Thank you.
