    Mr. Costello. Thank you, Mr. Chair. By the way of brief background, I used to be a township supervisor in Chester County, and we handled all land-use approvals. I then went on to be a county commissioner in Chester County. I see we have the NACo letterhead here; I was a proud member of NACo. But I never--I also was an attorney, a land-use lawyer who regularly dealt with regulations in terms of ultimately getting a project to the approval stage.    I share that with you because it is usually the case that a developer and a municipal official will find ways to disagree with one another during the course of an application. So the fact that you have NACo here and you have the homebuilders here, both saying that this is highly problematic, I think is very, very telling.    It concerns me that the status quo, as it exists right now, is not going to work, moving forward. It is simply unmanageable, and it is only going to get worse. And when you have RPAs that, for all intents and purposes--and I agree with the assertion by FEMA that additional set-aside land outside of the flood plain is outside of your jurisdiction, and yet you are being told, even though you have jurisdiction, that you must do that, I think that is highly problematic.    And what is going to continue to happen, or what is at least plausible, and I would submit as predictable, is what is happening is you will have an organization come in, file suit, if for no other reason than to simply expand the amount of developable--excuse me, to reduce the amount of developable land. And by developable land, I mean private property. And to Dr. Babin's point, land that comes off the tax rolls.    I don't understand how FEMA must essentially subordinate jurisdiction on this issue. And I just want to share a couple other points I found relevant, and then I will just open up to whomever would like to respond.    And most particularly comes from the--from NACo, from the mayor. Although participation in NFIP is technically voluntary, ``local governments have little choice but to comply with the participation requirements.'' In this way, participation requirements effectively serve as Federal regulations that force local governments to adjust their policies in order to maintain eligibility for the program.    That is one thing that you must deal with FEMA. And I don't mean this to be disrespectful towards FEMA, but there have been many times, as local officials, we voice frustration with FEMA. Not in your emergency response, but as it particularly relates to the flood plain management program. Now it is only going to become more frustrating. And it is not FEMA's fault, it is who FEMA has to deal with as a third party.    So I will invite any of you to pick up where I left off. But let me just say for the record this is not going to work, moving forward. Like, this will persist and it will essentially--and it will become, it already has become, a tactic that is going to be used in every single community, in every single State across this country, until we sit back and say, ``OK, somewhere along the line things went askew. How do we fix it?'' I think we need to fix it now.    I do think that there is a preemption issue here, where FEMA essentially needs to reassert its jurisdiction and the ESA cannot find its way in the middle of how we go about delineating flood plains and implementing the flood insurance program. Forty seconds.    Mr. Costello. Well, I mean, I would say--I would agree with you that FEMA--you view FEMA as a partner. I would think that FEMA wants to be that partner. I would ask FEMA to share--and the other thing that it is going to do is it is going to drive up costs on the private landowner side. It is also going to drive up the costs of approvals and the ultimate cost of whatever ultimately is able to get built. It is also going to drive up the cost of insurance for everybody.    But from the FEMA perspective, what is the solution, if--in a perfect world, what is the solution to how to address the encroachment on your jurisdiction?    Mr. Costello. And by ``prescriptive,'' you mean essentially ad hoc. Like, I mean----    Mr. Costello. Every community--I mean it is going to be a different flavor all across the--there is no uniformity, right?    Mr. Costello. The final point that I would make--I know I have gone well over my time, but if I could just make this--I think it becomes very difficult to evaluate risk when you don't have uniformity, because you, in essence, aren't necessarily guaranteeing or providing the same standard or level of standard uniformly across the country when you don't have uniformity as it relates to implementation of NFIP standards in the first instance. I mean, that is just another piece of it.    Now, that would be for the underwriters, but I just--this is very unworkable, and this concerns me greatly.    Thank you for allowing me to go over. I yield back.
