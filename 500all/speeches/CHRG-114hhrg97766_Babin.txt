    Mr. Babin. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, witnesses, for being here.    I--maybe I missed this a while ago but, Dr. DeCicco, can you tell me a little more about why corn ethanol is worse for air quality the gasoline? That may have already been asked and hashed but----    Mr. Babin. Okay. Thank you.    And should corn ethanol be classified as a green fuel then, given this environmental impact?    Mr. Babin. Yes. Okay. And now the Administration has proposed lowering the ozone standard, ambient air quality, to 70 parts per billion. In your opinion, would the RFS complicate efforts to attain a more stringent standard if that's the case?    Mr. Babin. But if you couple that with higher food prices and the other negatives of the ethanol industry, it certainly could have a detrimental effect, right?    Mr. Babin. Well, okay.    Mr. Babin. Okay. I was just thinking.    And, Dr. Dinan, what is your assessment of the impact of the RFS on blending of biofuels into the transportation fuel supply? And has the use of biofuels increased the cost of the RFS, or would we have seen ethanol production grow without a federal mandate? It's a three-part question.    Mr. Babin. Okay. Thank you. My time is expired. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
