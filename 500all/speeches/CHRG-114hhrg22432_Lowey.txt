    Mrs. Lowey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And welcome and thank you for your service, Secretary Carter, General Dunford, and Under Secretary McCord.    I know that there was some discussion before I arrived of the budget, but I would like to hear you say it again. What problems are created when Congress does not pass a spending bill by October 1? What does it do for your budget? And can you carry out the Department's mission within the amounts proposed in your fiscal year 2017 request?    Mrs. Lowey. Well, thank you. And I know, if it is up to Chairman Rogers and I, we will proceed with regular order.    But talking about competition and workforce, I would like to ask a question on cybersecurity. First of all, if you could please describe the primary risks faced by the Department of Defense in the cybersecurity realm. And the budget indicates that measures are taken to increase the capabilities of the Cyber Mission Force initiated in fiscal year 2013. If you could, describe the primary elements, and how does the budget request support your efforts in cybersecurity?    Mrs. Lowey. Thank, Mr. Chairman.
