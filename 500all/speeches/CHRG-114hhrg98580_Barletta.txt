    Mr. Barletta. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, when I was a little boy, I can remember my father taking me to Connie Mack Stadium in Philadelphia. And to go from Hazleton there you would have to get on to Schuylkill Expressway. Connie Mack--it was a long time, it was back in the 1960s. You know, Schuylkill Expressway is like the same Schuylkill Expressway today that it was back then. Imagine how many more cars are on the road since then. And, you know, I look at passenger rail. It probably hasn't improved much in time, either. We go to the airport, takes longer to go from point A to point B.    You know, transportation is important, it is critical in our lives, in everybody's lives. Time is money in the business community. They are competing in a global economy. But it is also--time is also valuable in the lives of everyday people, whether they are going on vacation, or they are just going to visit a friend or a relative. Delays and cancellations cost money, but it costs people time. And America's transportation system is falling further and further and further behind other countries' in the world.    I commend the chairman, because it is about time we modernize our system, we focus on safety, on efficiency, and lowering the cost to the users of the transportation system.    My question, Mr. Calio, how does a modern air traffic control system allow your members to better serve the flying public?    Mr. Barletta. Any time you want to do something big there are issues. But they are not issues that can't be overcome. And I wish, you know, we all sit and realize that. You know, if it was easy, somebody else would have done this already. And it is not easy. But I don't believe we should be throwing the baby out with the bath water. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
