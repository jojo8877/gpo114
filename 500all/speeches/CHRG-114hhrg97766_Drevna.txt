    Mr. Drevna. Chairmen Bridenstine and Loudermilk, Ranking Members Bonamici and Beyer, I am Charlie Drevna, Senior Fellow at the Institute for Energy Research.    You know, once Milton Friedman famously posited that one of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results. If he were alive today, Friedman would point to the RFS as a prime example of his belief.    In the mid-2000s and even before, so-called industry analysts and renowned economists predicted ever-increasing gasoline demand as they simultaneously declared the United States to be energy-scarce. The Nation was on a path according to the self-anointed experts to reliance on ever-increasing foreign sources of energy, much of which came from potentially unstable regions of the world.    Congress and the Administration accepted the reviews, and in 2005 adopted the Energy Policy Act, which required refiners to blend 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol into the gasoline pool by 2012. In less than two years, this nuisance of free market interference became a full-blown anti-consumer, anti-free market debacle as EISA '07 mandated 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels, some of which actually existed, be blended into domestic transportation fuels by 2022.    In essence, the predictions of 2007 and earlier are the polar opposite of the realities of 2015. Confounding the problem is the undeniable fact that advanced biofuels production, the anticipated linchpin of the RFS, has fallen woefully short of the numerous promises made since 2007.    I'm sure the Committee is familiar with such names as Range Fuels, KiOR, Blue Sugars, Absolute Fuels, New Energy Fuels, Green Diesel, and a host of others, most of whom have squandered taxpayer dollars or committed fraud, or both, and yet today we continue to hear that the economic production of cellulosic fuels is ``right around the corner.'' It's a big corner.    What's clear is that neither Congress nor EPA can mandate innovation or favorable economics, try as they may. The hard sciences of chemistry and physics remain immune to political science, and they remain formidable obstacles to economic production of commercial-scale cellulosic fuels. However, one should not discount the innovation provided by EPA to assist in this effort. EPA stipulates that ethanol produced from sugarcane qualifies in advanced biofuel. That's helping to meet the statutory volume requirements. What's ironic about this news is that ethanol produced from sugarcane is imported mostly from Brazil. So much for that homegrown stuff. And the intent--and what was the intent of the RFS to limit imported fuels? Okay.    So what State virtually imports all of this biofuel? Well, that would be California. And why California? The State's low carbon fuel standard requires refiners to use millions of gallons of advanced biofuel, and imported sugarcane is the only available product that fits that definition, as unscientific as that definition is. Yes, that's correct. California prohibits ethanol from U.S. producers and imports it from Brazil. This allows California legislators and regulators to promote themselves as pioneers in the green movement.    So what happens to the ethanol from the U.S. producers that would've otherwise gone and been delivered to California? The Brazilians don't care if their ethanol comes from sugar or corn, so California and Brazil swap their ethanol, literally two ships passing in the night. The net outcome, higher shipping costs, and ironically, increases in GHG emissions.    Not satisfied with the overall results, EPA then decided to enhance the total production of cellulosic fuels not via scientific breakthrough. Rather, it would be much simpler to change the definition of cellulosic fuels to include a portion of biogas produced from landfills. If you look at the volume increases in cellulosic production 2014 through '15, it's nearly all attributable to EPA semantics. Why let pesky little details such as chemical structure and definition get in the way of a predetermined outcome?    If one were to be intellectually honest, the RFS was never about energy security, the environment, or national security. It's been accurately described as crony capitalism, although the use of the term capitalism in reference to the RFS is a basic non sequitur. It may be much more accurate to label the RFS and other anti-free market mandates, subsidies, and giveaways for what they really are: government attempting to pick the winners and losers in the marketplace. And the government's track record is most illustrative as its penchant for picking losers is quite outstanding.    Even if the intentions of the RFS were noble, the program must be judged on its results. It's past time for Congress to admit that the RFS has not delivered and will not deliver anticipated results. The law should be repealed and allow for American ingenuity, entrepreneurship, and free-market enterprise to do what it does best. They haven't failed the nation yet.    Thank you very much.                      Mr. Drevna. Absolutely.    Mr. Drevna. MTBE was found in groundwater because we had a leaking underground storage tank debacle in the country, and EPA passed a bill--I mean passed a regulation that gave underground storage tanks ten years to comply but then the RFG2 came into play and we had to put more oxygenate into the gasoline.    Mr. Drevna. If you have a leaking underground storage tank, by what I've seen in the studies would indicate that the ethanol will separate out first from the water and then it--as--whereas the bacteria would go after the BTEX compounds--benzene, toluene, xylene--in the underground water and the MTBE would traverse further, the bacteria likes their cocktails before dinner so they have the--they go for the ethanol first. But in essence, you know, I think we've fixed the underground storage tank problem in the country, which was the root of the problem.    Mr. Drevna. Okay, it was very soluble in water.    Mr. Drevna. Yes. Yes.    Mr. Drevna. So is ethanol.    Mr. Drevna. No, what happens--ethanol has an affinity for water.    Mr. Drevna. That's why when one of the previous witnesses talked or maybe Mr. Chairman talked about the outdoor power equipment and the marine people. The marine folks don't like a lot of ethanol, if it all----    Mr. Drevna. --in--to use in marine equipment because the ethanol will separate out and marine----    Mr. Drevna. Well, you know, it's corrosive to certain pumps and flanges and hoses and things----    Mr. Drevna. --but, you know, again, the reason for the marine folks who don't want it is because ethanol has an affinity for water.    Mr. Drevna. Yes, I have a comment on that, and--some of the things that my colleague here Mr. Coleman has been talking about, a free market, MTBE, the RFG2 was a free market. The ethanol folks clamored because the consumer didn't want ethanol. The consumer still doesn't want it in massive quantities.    Mr. Drevna. I don't know where to start. I just can't believe what I just heard in this hearing room. First of all, the--there still is--as the doctor said at the end of the table said, there's still a ten percent maximum blend wall you can't meet. And that automobile or that lawnmower or that chainsaw doesn't give anything about where that ethanol comes from, whether it's cellulosic or whether it's corn or whether it's some still in West Virginia. It's ethanol. And we have blend wall. Even EPA, who I very rarely agree with, says there's a blend wall problem, and it will be for the distant future.    Number two, Mr. Coleman keeps on talking about this grand conspiracy of the big oil trying to stop penetration into the market. Well, the reality of the situation is big oil, little oil, independent refiner in, you know, in the middle of the corn belt, they do not control anything to do with the market. Ninety-five percent of the retail market is controlled by independent operators, just as my colleague down here, Mr. Anderson, is an independent operator for a franchise. It's the same thing. If those franchisees want to sell more ethanol or want to put in E85 pumps, have at it.    If my friends from the advanced biofuel or the corn ethanol folks want to invest rather than sup at the government trough year in and year out, they can put the money--they could talk to the owners of these--of the gas stations and say, hey, we're going to invest with you because it's got to be--it's not oil versus advanced.    Mr. Drevna. It's what the consumer wants.    Mr. Drevna. Yes, I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman. This whole thing, you know--and Mr. Coleman is right. The--and he used the right term, too. He said the corn ethanol flatlines after this year, 15, you know, some billion gallons. The problem is is that the EISA '07 calls for 36 billion gallons of phantom fuel--or 22 billion of which are phantom fuels by 2022. What are we going to do? What's the refining industry--what are the obligated parties going to do between now and 2022 when, you know, if you look at the success/failure rate of these advanced biofuels, there's--you know, as I said in my testimony, if it weren't for EPA to change the--a scientific definition and you look at the testimony, the production from these facilities is minuscule, and it's going to be minuscule.    So are we supposed to say, well, it's right around the corner so you obligated parties keep sending money to the federal government and buying tax credit--or credits to keep this industry going, or do you want to let investors invest in this stuff just like every other entrepreneur in this country has done forever and make a better product and take the risk rather than have them being propped up by the government and then having the taxpayer end up paying for it? That's the choice you have to make. I appreciate the ability to respond.
