    Dr. MacDonald. Just quickly. The Sandy supplemental allowed us to work on both the assimilation and the models really effectively, so there are some improvements that we are going to see in the relatively near future that I think will really help with the gap.    Dr. MacDonald. Actually, I think that we can go faster, partly because we do have a lot of experience with these sensors like ATMS and CRiS and so on, so we have--with our Joint Center and with our OAR research colleagues, we think we can do better.    Dr. MacDonald. My comment would be as Mr. Powner just said, we are really working hard on many, many ways of improving things, a lot of it because of the Sandy supplemental funding, so I think there has been a positive that has come out of this, and we are excited to see some improvements from those efforts.    Dr. MacDonald. I think hyperspectral is another sensor that has a lot of potential and we are trying to study that with various techniques.    Dr. MacDonald. Yeah, we have interferometers that give us indication of what you can get from a polar orbiter but there is also a geostationary issue that we are trying to learn about.    Dr. MacDonald. Thank you, Representative Bonamici. It does--we really do depend on the polar orbiters and the satellite sensors. It is our whole Earth look, and with time, we used to--when I started my career, we had little models over little areas and now we can do the whole Earth. So these sensors you have already heard so much about, the interferometers, the microwave. They really are the future, and I think forecasts are going to improve because of it.    So we use one. That is a difficult thing. One area that is important is that we use these for also records of how the--what is happening in climate, so we have lots of in situ sensors and lots of satellites. We try and make up by using continuity from those.    Dr. MacDonald. No, but thank you for asking.    Dr. MacDonald. I think that in--if we talk about our operational computing, it has been behind for quite some time. However, it was recently announced that we are going to get a major upgrade to our operational computing. I think it is actually five petaflops this fall, and I think that puts us on a par with the others, and I want to say that that is a big part of the mitigation, that is, we think with that additional computing, it is going to help us a lot in our predictions and help for the gap.
