    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I too want to congratulate you on the chairmanship of this very important committee, of which I'm pleased to be a part of. I want to thank all of our witnesses for coming. I worked at one juncture during my life as a training director, with the purpose of trying to bring low-income individuals into the medical field. So I know the challenges that you face, and I know the difficulty of your work.    Mr. King, I represent much of the inner city part of Chicago. And so I see first-hand many individuals, low-income, who desperately would like to have a good job so that they could work and take care of their families. But they often lack the skills and training or education necessary to achieve this. For this reason, my Responsible Fatherhood bill proposes to modernize the TANF Contingency Fund to provide additional employment and training opportunities by focusing the Contingency Fund, to fund sectorial training, coupled with other structured TANF reforms. This re-design of the Contingency Fund promises to make quality education and training more available to the TANF recipients. Could you speak to the success of such programs, and what they've done?    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you.    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you very much. And Mr. Brame, let me just tell you, I am intrigued by the work that Cascades Engineering is doing, and compliment you and all of those who work at your company. You mentioned removing barriers. And one of the groups that I'm particularly concerned about in terms of barriers are individuals with criminal backgrounds. Could you amplify a bit on how you handle that, and what you do with it?    Mr. DAVIS. Thank you very much, and I really appreciate the effort. And I think that is an excellent approach. And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
