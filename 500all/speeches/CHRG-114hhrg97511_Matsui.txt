    Ms. Matsui. I thank the ranking member for yielding me time. I thank the witness for being here today.    We all agree that the rising rates of obesity and the resulting chronic health conditions constitute a health crisis in our country. And we all agree that access to nutrition information is an important step in addressing the obesity epidemic.    The Affordable Care Act took great strides toward addressing this epidemic by requiring nutrition labeling at restaurants and other places where people purchase food.    The FDA has been working to implement this requirement in a reasonable way, and to provide guidance to stakeholders who have legitimate concerns about their ability to comply. However, to the extent that additional guidance is not supplied well in advance of the December 1 deadline, additional time is warranted.    I look forward to working with the FDA and stakeholders to ensure that this provision is successfully implemented to benefit consumers without imposing overly burdensome or impractical requirements on our businesses.    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and working with my colleagues to address this issue going forward, and I yield back the balance of my time.
