    Ms. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Killen, I wanted to talk about what the IRS is doing to ensure that document and preservation measures are being implemented so that we do not end up here again, which no one wants. It seems strange that we are having a full committee hearing because of one employee's hard drive, especially since all but 2 weeks of his emails were preserved. What is the current IRS policy with respect to document preservation for departing employees, and how long are their emails kept?    Ms. Kelly. And how long are they kept?    Ms. Kelly. Okay. What is the IRS doing right now to ensure that an instance such the Maruca case does not occur again?    Ms. Kelly. Right.    Ms. Kelly. So would you look at this as your longer-term solution, or do you have other long-term solutions as it relates to hard drive inventory management?    Ms. Kelly. And once you get there, this will allow you to answer inquiries from Congress faster or FOIA requests? Do you feel like you will be faster at that?    Ms. Kelly. I am out of time. Thanks.
