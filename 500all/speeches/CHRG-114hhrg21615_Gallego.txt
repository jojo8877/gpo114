    Mr. Gallego. Thank you, Mr. Chair.    Ms. Goldfuss, thank you for being here and for your tireless work on these issues.    Many see NEPA as a bedrock environmental statute aiming to make smart decisions while we develop our infrastructure, and I agree. However, I also see NEPA as a statute that protects the public's voice and its power to protect their health and safety as we develop their infrastructure.    As a Latino who represents a heavily Latino district, I know firsthand how critical it is to have a process in place that allows communities like mine, communities that have historically been marginalized and lack a voice in policymaking when it comes to projects in their backyards, a role and opportunity for input.    So, I see an attack on NEPA as an attack on the public voice. Anything that makes NEPA more consistent and reliable strengthens that public voice.    Can you tell us how this NEPA guidance will help the public have more influence over what happens in their communities?    Mr. Gallego. Excellent. Thank you, I yield back.    The Chairman. Mr. Hice.
