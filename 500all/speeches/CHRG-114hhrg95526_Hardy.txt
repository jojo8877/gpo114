    Mr. HARDY. Thank you. I apologize for being late.    Mr. Stanford, in your testimony, you had talked about Amazon as an example of how the GSA--and I hope somebody has not asked this question already--would place the burden on contractors and report contract information although the agency already has the data awarded to the contract. To me this is just another add-on of frustration to contractors. Being a small business individual, I have had to deal with federal contracts before. It appears to me that this is just another way of government trying to solve their issue rather than take care of the problems themselves that they have the information at their hands.    Would you agree to that in somewhat of that fashion? I have a little bit harder way of saying it, but that is----    Mr. HARDY. Does anybody believe that GSA has maybe underestimated the real cost of what this is going to impact the businesses? Does anybody care to address that?    Mr. HARDY. I will take it another direction.    Being a business guy, you know, I work on bids. I was a general engineering contractor, so I put out bids. Now they are asking you to detail everything you got. All your information that you have that might put you in the competitive motion, they are wanting us to provide that information, which they ask for line item bids. I do not have a problem with numbers because my clients and the rest of the stuff, do you not see that being a problem with the way that we are getting hacked around here in this federal government of maybe those issues of privacy out there? Anybody?    Mr. HARDY. Thank you. My time is expired. I yield back.
