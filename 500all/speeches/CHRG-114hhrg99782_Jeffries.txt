    Mr. Jeffries. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I want to thank the witnesses for your presence here today and the informative testimony today. I will start with Ms. Okun. The ITC proceedings are limited in terms of the ultimate remedy to equitable relief. Is that correct?    Mr. Jeffries. Okay. Now once that determination is made as to what the appropriate remedy would be, either cease-and-desist or an exclusion order, there is then a process, as I understand it, for the--I guess it is called the Office of Unfair Import Investigations. Is that correct?    Mr. Jeffries. And what exactly is the role that they play in an ITC proceeding?    Mr. Jeffries. Yes, and I appreciate the thorough answer. And the role essentially is to function as an ombudsman in the public interest or an advocate in the public interest during the proceedings? Is that right?    Mr. Jeffries. Just sort of walking through the procedural determinations, if a conclusion is made that there was infringement but it is subsequently determined, notwithstanding the infringement, that it is in the public interest not to permit exclusion, at what point in the process is that public interest determination made? It is my understanding that comes at the end, not the beginning. Is that right?    Mr. Jeffries. The issue, in conclusion, that I want to raise is it seems to me that if, in fact, there are a set of circumstances which suggest that even if infringement may ultimately be found during the course of the determinations by the ALJ or by the ITC, that there is a strong enough public interest in not allowing for exclusion or even cease and desist, should that not actually happen at the beginning of the process as opposed to an entire litigation taking place? A finding of infringement, but ultimately no order issued to exclude or cease and desist because of the strength of the public interest?    Mr. Jeffries. My time is expired.    Mr. Jeffries. Thank you. I yield back.
