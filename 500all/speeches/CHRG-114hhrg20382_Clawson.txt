    Mr. Clawson. Thank you for coming. Thank you for your important work.    Mr. Clawson. My firsthand experience tells me that for subsistence farmers to make meaningful progress, A, they have to have diversification, which you have spoken to, and B, they have to have credit.    And we have been talking about microcredit since I was in college and I have got a lot of gray hair right now. And so I hear and read and see with my own eyes lots of really good programs, small programs in Southeast Asia, Africa, or wherever.    But given the level of corruption for a lot or most of these governments, depending on how charitable we want to be, I don't know of any examples of countries that are struggling with hunger that also have widespread microcredit available for a market of struggling subsistence farmers. And without that, all of this is just anecdotal talk to me. I'm glad you're doing what you're doing.    But if there's no microcredit in Africa or Southeast Asia at a broad level because there is so much corruption and there is not a developed private market for it, we are just blowing in the wind as far as I can tell.    Am I wrong about what I'm saying or--I'd like you to tell me I'm wrong and there is a country that is struggling to make the jump and that has a large noncorrupt microcredit market for people that need it. Does that exist in the world?    Mr. Clawson. And what country actually has a functioning microcredit market for these kind of folks? Does that exist?    I love what you're telling me. But does that exist?    Mr. Clawson. I'm not saying that it doesn't exist. I'm asking you. You know, is there anywhere in Southeast Asia or Africa of a developing country that has a microcredit market that actually gives poor people an opportunity to expand their crops, without paying 20 percent a month?
