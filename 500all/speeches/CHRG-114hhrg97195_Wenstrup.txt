    Dr. Wenstrup. I do have one quick question. And may not even be appropriate to answer it in this setting, to be honest with you. I think you probably, sir, have a great understanding of what readiness means. And what you would feel would be 100 percent readiness within your jurisdiction.    And like I said, it may not be appropriate to answer in this setting, but I would be curious to know what percentage of readiness you feel we are at right now.    Dr. Wenstrup. I think it is very clear it is not 100 percent right now. Would you agree with that, sir?    Dr. Wenstrup. When you consider you have a backlog of maintenance, how can we be 100 percent ready?    Dr. Wenstrup. Thank you very much. I appreciate your being here this morning and for your service.
