    Mr. Meadows. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Shelanski, let me follow up on where the chairman left off with regards to responsiveness, and where Mr. Connolly of Virginia, because the indication that you have given this committee is that you're doing all that you possibly can as fast as you possibly can to comply with the subpoena. Is that your sworn testimony here today?    Mr. Meadows. So can you----    Mr. Meadows. Can you----    Mr. Meadows. Can you explain to the committee why the initial request that I made of you for documents, why it required a subpoena to get you to comply? Because when we look at it, there were only 47 unique documents that we couldn't find online that you gave this committee between the initial response and June 4, only 47 that weren't found online, and that's one every other day. Is that the best you can do?    Mr. Meadows. In what realm would you think that this committee would ask you for documents that are publicly available?    Mr. Meadows. If we can go online, we don't need your staff to do that. We can find it. Why would we ask for that?    Mr. Meadows. Okay. You've given this committee a little over 1,300 documents that are unique in a year's time, 1,300, three a day. Is that the best that your staff can do? Is that the best that you can do, three a day?    Mr. Meadows. That's not the question. You're giving an answer to a question. Is that the best, yes or no? Is it the best you can do?    Mr. Meadows. Slow start? You got a subpoena and you didn't do anything for 4 months. That's not a slow start, Mr. Shelanski, that's a no start.    Mr. Meadows. Okay. Stop right there. So you got the search for the documents. What is that universe?    Mr. Meadows. Because we have to know the universe in order for there to be a search. What was the universe?    Mr. Meadows. Yeah, the universe.    Mr. Meadows. All right. You've given to me 100 percent of your documents, according to your testimony.    Mr. Meadows. Have they been turned over to the committee, 100 percent of your documents?    Mr. Meadows. Well, then how can you say that nothing has been given or held back from this committee, because your testimony is you've testified that 100 percent of your documents have been turned over? How many does that include?    Mr. Meadows. Okay. Let me stop you, because you're mischaracterizing.    Mr. Meadows. Six months we allowed you to prioritize. That did not come from this committee; that came from your staff in conjunction with this committee. We asked--we allowed you to start with the first 6 months.    So, out of the 6 months of documents that you're about to talk about, what is the universe? How many total documents?    Mr. Meadows. So it's taken a year, and you still don't know how many documents?    Mr. Meadows. Mr. Shelanski--all right. Let me stop you again.    Mr. Meadows. One year, we need to know, how many documents are you reviewing? What is the universe of that? You only have 45 employees. I could probably come into your office and figure out the universe for the last 6 months within a few days.    Mr. Meadows. Okay.    Mr. Meadows. Mr. Shelanski, you and two other of your senior OIRA officials have said that you've turned over 100 percent of your documents. You can't have it both ways. Either you turned over 100 percent and we know the number, or you haven't turned over 100 percent, or that testimony is false. Which is it?    Mr. Meadows. So do you know how many documents you've turned over, the number?    Mr. Meadows. No, no. Your 100 percent, how many is that--5,000, 15,000--how many?    Mr. Meadows. Mr. Shelanski, let me close with this: I am frustrated with your inability to answer questions that we've asked over and over and over. And you're here for sworn testimony today. These questions should not be a surprise to you. If you can't answer them, then say that you're not intending to answer them, so we will know to take the appropriate--but we keep asking. I asked in October, 5 months. It's a simple question. Can you not answer the question here today? Are you not prepared to answer?    Mr. Meadows. How many documents are there?    Mr. Meadows. How many total documents have you turned over?    Mr. Meadows. Mr. Chairman----    Mr. Meadows. --this witness is being unresponsive, and I think we need to deal with it appropriately.    I yield back.
