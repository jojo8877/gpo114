    Mr. Bost. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First off, we probably went down this earlier, but I have been bouncing in and out of the room. Mr. Policinski, I would like to know if I can what your company is already--because Vermont has already passed a law. Are you preparing already and whether those costs that you are seeing and everything for one state and how you are going to handle it. Because I know we have talked about three different options that could be available. And where are you going with that at this time?    Mr. Bost. That is pending, yes.    Mr. Bost. Mr. Dempsey, did you want to----    Mr. Bost. Just to continue and maybe even a statement as I am continuing questions, as we deal with GMOs, okay, in our own family, we have had to deal with gluten-free. My wife is gluten-free. Companies automatically, voluntarily, mark their products as gluten-free to encourage the sales of those to those who are. What would be the difference here in this, proposing that it would be voluntary?    Mr. Bost. That is right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.    The Chairman. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Walz, for 5 minutes?
