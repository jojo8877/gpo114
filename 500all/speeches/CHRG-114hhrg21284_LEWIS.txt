    Mr. LEWIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing this morning.    I want to thank all of the witnesses for being here.    Ms. Rohlman, thank you for coming all the way from Atlanta to be here and to testify.    Ms. Vallas, as we work to prevent overpayment, you have cautioned us about avoiding unintended consequences, that they end up hurting qualified disability or UI claimants.    Can you review for us proposals that might end up being benefit cuts for very needy Americans as opposed to reduction in fraud and abuse.    Mr. LEWIS. Thank you very much for your response.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
