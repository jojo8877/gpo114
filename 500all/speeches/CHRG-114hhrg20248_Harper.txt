    Mr. Harper. With that, I will be brief and respect my chairman.    Thank you all for being here. Mr. Webster, if I could ask what types of economic and workplace problems do wearables solve for business?    Mr. Harper. Mr. Bianculli, can you comment on that as well?    Mr. Harper. All right. Thank you very much.    Mr. Harper. Thank you. Mr. Palliparambil, given NXP's presence in many of the wearable devices on the market today, do we currently have the infrastructure to support the rapidly growing wearables market and accommodate multiple users?    Mr. Harper. Thank you.    Mr. Harper. In the interest of time, I am going to yield back. The chairman may want to talk. Thank you.
