    Mr. Conaway. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you for being here.    Being the only CPA on the subcommittee panel, I'm trying to do the math. The original version was $550 million a copy? At just--$31 billion or $33 billion was the original cost. How do you buy 100 at $550 million apiece for $33 billion? And how does that get less at $41 billion or $58 billion?    Mr. Conaway. So you are not buying 100.    Mr. Conaway. Okay. So, Ms. Grant, you mentioned that the Air Force is using a different procurement program that is successful. Maybe I got lost in the conversation, but the most recent--about the F-22 and F-35, how is the Air Force going to avoid--the years on the F-35 or the F-22, mid-1980s to 2006--so how does the Air Force avoid doing that same thing again?    Mr. Conaway. How does that circumvent the normal procurement process?    Mr. Conaway. Is that the same group that did the MRAPS and body armor?    Mr. Conaway. From a complexity standpoint, the F-35 was a more complex platform than this or less complex?    Mr. Conaway. Okay, is it fair to say, without describing what we are talking about, that there were certain breakthrough technologies on the F-35, that you won't have to reinvent that wheel on the bomber, that would shorten the delivery time?    Mr. Conaway. I yield back.
