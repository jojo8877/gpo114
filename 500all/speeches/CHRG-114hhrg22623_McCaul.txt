    Mr. McCaul. Thank you, Chairman Donovan. Let me congratulate you on your first hearing, your inaugural hearing. I kind-of like the sound of that.    Mr. McCaul. It seems like today's a New York day. I can't think of a more important topic, though, for you to hold your first hearing on.    I want to welcome the mayor of New York, and also my fire chief, Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr, who is also the president of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and she's a friend of mine back home.    As Chairman Donovan noted, we are at our highest threat level since 9/11, and, in fact, I recently released a report examining the 75 ISIS-linked terror plots against the West, to date, up from 19 in 2014.    ISIS has reached an unprecedented level of terror plotting against the United States and our allies. Despite this growing threat, the President's budget falls short where we need it the most. Our city streets have become the front lines in the war against Islamist terror, yet the President proposes slashing funding to State and local first responders.    Let me just say for the record, I have been to New York many times. I know I am from Texas, but I know that New York is perhaps the No. 1 target in the Nation. It is very important that we keep New York safe from this very high-threat level that is out there.    We cannot let these cuts stand. I look forward to working with Chairman Donovan, and also the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations for Homeland Security, and our friends across the aisle to ensure that our first responders have the tools that they need to get this job done.    With that, I yield back.
