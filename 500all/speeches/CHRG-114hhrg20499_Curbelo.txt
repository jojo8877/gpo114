    Mr. Curbelo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I am going to be very brief, because my colleague, Mr. Maloney, who joined me in filing H.R. 5292, asked a lot of the questions that I wanted to raise.    But I will just say Mr. Rinaldi earlier described a situation in Atlanta which resembles a situation that we are experiencing in Miami. Of course Miami International Airport is the main economic driver in south Florida, and we have 91 positions, but only 58 fully certified controllers. So exactly what Mr. Rinaldi explained in Atlanta, this is a crisis for us. And that is why Mr. Maloney and I came together to introduce H.R. 5292. We believe that it is going to give the FAA a clear mandate, clear direction to solve this hiring crisis once and for all.    So I would just like to ask all of my colleagues who have not yet cosponsored the legislation, we are up to 122 bipartisan cosponsors. If you are not on yet, get on. And I would like to ask our leadership in both chambers, here in the House on both sides, Republican and Democrat, to help us advance this legislation. Because if my colleagues think that this TSA line issue is a problem, if we don't get this right, this is going to become a much greater problem for our air transportation system in this country.    So I want to thank Mr. Rinaldi for all his comments today in support of this legislation. I want to thank the chairman, the ranking member, for holding this very timely hearing on this matter.    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
