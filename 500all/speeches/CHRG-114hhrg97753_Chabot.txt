    Mr. Chabot. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for holding this hearing. And we thank our witnesses. Looking forward to hearing what they have to say this afternoon.    It seems in recent months due to the growing problems in Syria, and the Iran nuclear agreement, and ISIS and a litany of other major issues all across the world, that Afghanistan to some degree, has kind of been, I think, on the back burner of this administration, has kind of fallen from view in many ways. However, without question the increase in terrorist attacks across the globe is a real threat to stability in the world, the future of Afghanistan, and could really undermine U.S. interests. All of us on this committee have paid particular attention of the mounting threat ISIS has posed. And I think it is fair to stay that the administration fails to do due diligence to ensure stability in Afghanistan, that we are going to see a resurgence in terrorism there as well.    A thoughtful and cohesive strategy continues to be essential in preventing the expansion of al-Qaeda and ISIS and other terrorist organizations in Afghanistan. And it is my hope that the administration and our regional partners give Afghanistan the long-term strategic outlook it deserves as we move forward. And thank you very much, Madam Chair.
