    Mr. Amodei. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you both for the briefing.    Ms. Olson, I am trying to get a sense for--I mean, I hear the part about budget cuts and resource allocation. I am trying to get a sense--the IRS has been cut 17 percent.    Can you give me a feel for what your operation has been cut? Has it been 17? More? Less?    Mr. Amodei. And then can you give me a profile of the folks that kind of hit in the middle of the driveway that you help.    And let me tell you why I am asking the question. Because I know there are statistics out there that the top 10 percent of the population pays X amount of the tax, but it is a large amount.    So I would assume, in any organization, when you are, as you should be, pursuing collections, that you go to where those collections are the most in need of pursuit.    So I am assuming that the Warren Buffets and the Bill Gates of the world aren't calling you up and saying, ``Hey, what do I do on my Schedule''--blah, blah. It is most of those folks who probably fall into however it breaks down.    Can you give me an idea of who it is, the demographic or where on that rainbow those folks fall that you are serving.    Mr. Amodei. So you are serving--if these aren't your words, do not adopt them.    But you are serving predominantly people who represent, generally, what portion of income to the IRS----    Mr. Amodei . Percentage-wise?    Mr. Amodei. Okay. Would it be possible, if you had some time, to----    Mr. Amodei. Okay.    Mr. Amodei. Okay.    Mr. Amodei. Thank you.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
