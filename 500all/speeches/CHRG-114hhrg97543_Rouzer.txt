    Mr. Rouzer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you both for being here today. I appreciate it very, very much. And I found both of your testimonies very intriguing.    I have always felt like if we got our agriculture policy right, our energy policy right, and our infrastructure policy right, we are in the catbird seat for centuries to come.    Now, one issue that is very, very intriguing to me, and I am trying to wrap my mind around it, Mr. Ambassador, you talked about it a little earlier during the course of this hearing, and that is water. I never would have thought when I was growing up as a kid that one day I would be drinking a bottle of water that you buy. When I was growing up, if you wanted water, you just went to your garden hose. And much less never would have thought anybody would pay $5 for a cup of coffee. So the world changes. And certainly, water is becoming more and more of a scarce resource. In agriculture you can't grow anything without the sun and without water. Mr. Newhouse and I, and several other Members, were in Israel earlier this year during the course of the August recess, and they do a magnificent job over there of water conservation and recycling of their water. And I believe, if I recall, they recycle close to 80 percent of their water there. So I am just curious, based on your experience and your thoughts, if you could talk more about water and the issue, and what we need to be doing here in this country. Obviously, it has been a very acute problem in California and other parts of the country based on the climate, et cetera, and it is something we really need to start thinking about now. And so I am just curious your thoughts and analysis of that.    Mr. Rouzer. Dr. Beckham, do you have any thoughts on that?    Mr. Rouzer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back my time.    The Chairman. The gentleman yields back.    Mr. Thompson, for 5 minutes.
