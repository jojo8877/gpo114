    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you, Madam Chair.    Just following up on my colleague Mr. Cook's questions, you know, the concern is you are talking about robust engagement with ISI. But there has been evidence time and time again of their direct and indirect connections with the Haqqani Network. In 2011, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullin, called the Haqqani Network a veritable arm of the ISI. So as you are having these discussions, you talked a lot about how more must be done; discussions are taking place. But I am wondering what action, what change in U.S. policy has occurred that would actually bring about a consequential shift?    Ms. Gabbard. Has there been any change in the aid packages of the funding we are providing?    Ms. Gabbard. Well, I think the concern is that there, to say there are serious doubts is an understatement on Pakistan's credibility when we talk about fighting these Islamic extremist elements, these terrorist elements and even with nuclear cooperation. I think one of the greatest concerns, as we look at how closely connected the Haqqani Network and others are to Pakistan, is the safety of the nuclear weapons that they have and preventing misuse. You have just said that you have confidence in the Pakistani security forces. But when you have these insider threats, when you have the Haqqani Network being an arm of the ISI, how can you have confidence that they would not in any case gain access to these nuclear weapons or traffic them or get them into the wrong hands?    Ms. Gabbard. Can you speak with some specificity?    Ms. Gabbard. Can you speak specifically to what Pakistan and the government has done to crack down on the Haqqani Network or these other terrorist elements that have been and are directly linked to them?    Ms. Gabbard. Thank you. My time has expired. But I think as we look at U.S. policy toward Pakistan, this is something that we need to carefully consider. Thank you.
