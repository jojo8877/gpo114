    Ms. DelBene. Thank you, Chairman Davis.    And thank you, Dr. Morris, for being with us here today.    In recent years, the way the average consumer thinks about food has undergone a remarkable cultural transformation. Within a relatively short period of time, we have witnessed consumers rapidly moving from having little interest in products and where their food comes from to today's consumers seeing food as an exciting possibility, and with cooking now part of personal discovery.    Most importantly, both for the consumer and for agriculture, food is no longer something that just appears on grocery shelves. It is inspected, scrutinized, and given careful thought. Consumers are the real drivers behind today's individualistic food environment, and it is within this newly-developed foodie culture that the U.S. production agriculture now finds itself. Like most market evolution, there is both good news and not so good news.    The good news is food entrepreneurs, both producers and processors, have an increasingly diverse consumer base for which to tailor their products. The not-so-good news is an ever-growing and potentially confusing array of production, processing, and questions. And while more information for the consumer is a good thing, we need to ensure that this information is displayed in an easy to understand and accurate way. And we also need to ensure that the information provided is grounded in sound science.    I am pleased that the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service is here today because of their expertise in overseeing these emerging labels. We need to know how to best deliver information to the consumer, what is working now, what isn't, and how we continually improve the current system. As the Committee exercises its responsibility in the area of marketing and labeling claims across the board, but including labels related to genetically engineered crops, it is critical that we all have a full understanding of the expertise that exists within AMS should Congress choose to move forward with any sort of new label.    So, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to hearing from our witness today on this important matter, and I yield back.    The Chairman. Thank you.    The chair would request that other Members submit their opening statements for the record so that the witness may begin his testimony and to ensure that there is ample time for questions.    The chair would like to remind Members that they will be recognized for questioning in order of seniority for Members who are present at the start of the hearing. After that, Members will be recognized in order of their arrival. I appreciate the Members' understanding.    The witness is reminded to limit his oral presentation to 5 minutes. Your written statement will be included in the record.    I would like to welcome, once again, our witness, Dr. Craig Morris, Deputy Administrator, Livestock Poultry and Seed Program, at the Agricultural Marketing Service of the USDA based here in Washington, D.C.    Dr. Morris, please begin when you are ready.            STATEMENT OF CRAIG MORRIS, Ph.D., DEPUTY    Ms. DelBene. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you again, Dr. Morris, for being here. One of my main concerns when we are talking about any potential GMO or non-GMO certification program is that it not conflict in any way with the organic regulations or process that is already in place. Many in the industry, though certainly not uniformly, view organic certifications as the gold standard. And so I was wondering, in your opinion, would the current organic certification be sufficient to be labeled as non-GMO?    Ms. DelBene. I would appreciate that. That would be helpful.    And in today's fiscal environment where resources are definitely scarce all around, I worry that with the new certification process, resources could be diverted away from other important programs, not only organic programs but programs across the board. So can you comment on how this might be avoided, or are more resources needed if we were going to have other programs that were going to be available?    Ms. DelBene. And any other particular programs that might be put together would probably be user-funded as well then?    Ms. DelBene. You also talked earlier about the need for a quality management system. And so I wondered if you could describe what that is, and are they used in areas other than agriculture?    Ms. DelBene. And you brought out the ISO, International Organization for Standardization. And why do you use their guidelines, and so how did you go about using their guidelines, and how did they establish them?    Ms. DelBene. Thank you.    That completes my questions. I will yield back.    The Chairman. Wow. Succinct hearing. We actually have Members yielding back time.    Mr. Moolenaar is recognized for 5 minutes.    Ms. DelBene. I have no further questions. I want to thank you, again, for being here and appreciate your follow-up on the earlier information from your colleague.    Ms. DelBene. Thank you.    The Chairman. Today, the Subcommittee examined the tools and capabilities of USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service to assist food producers to market their products. As we look more closely at the types of products consumers are demanding, we need to have the programs in place to ensure that the claims made on product labels are truthful and not misleading.    The farmers want and need to provide consumers with the products they desire. And as we have just heard, the Agricultural Marketing Service has the tools and expertise to provide consumers with the information they want in a manner that supports interstate commerce.    We will soon consider a substitute amendment to H.R. 1599, the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, which seeks to put in place the policy to make this work. That substitute is circulating in draft form and will continue to go through refinement as we near Committee consideration. Consumers are now being exposed to arbitrary and inconsistent label claims, some for non-GE products such as salt, where there is obviously no genetically engineered salt. Consumers will benefit from legislation under consideration, which would establish a national uniform and voluntary marketing approach to these label claims. The House Committee on Agriculture has a long history of involvement in developing policies to further the advancement of agricultural biotechnology. We are aware of the incredible potential this technology brings to food and fiber production. With biotechnology, the careful and precise addition of one or a few genes to a plant may make it more productive and nutritious, more tolerant to environmental stresses such as drought, and more resistant to disease and pests.    These technologies can likewise improve the efficiency and therefore, the productivity of agriculture, while at the same time, reducing detrimental effects on the environment. These and other advances have enabled us to enjoy the safest highest quality, most abundant and affordable supply of food and fiber in mankind's history. As our knowledge has increased, so has the speed and precision in which we are able to harness natural capabilities to improve the plants that we cultivate.    We just heard from the USDA that they have the capability and resources to provide the valuable oversight of these voluntary marketing claims. We know from previous hearings in this Committee as well as the Energy and Commerce Committee that we have a robust regulatory review process to ensure human, plant, and animal health as well as environmental health. We look forward to everyone's thoughtful review and constructive suggestions. And with that, I want to thank the witness for his time here today. I look forward to having you back in front of this Subcommittee to discuss this legislation further.    And with that, under the rules of the Committee, a record of today's hearing will remain open for 10 calendar days to receive additional material and supplementary written responses from the witness to any questions posed by a Member. This Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research hearing is now adjourned.
