    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our witnesses for providing very valuable information.    I'm encouraged by our government's rapid response to the Zika virus, and the assistance we have provided and are continuing to provide in the areas most affected by the outbreak. This in my opinion underscores one of the most important messages we hear every time we have a hearing on disease outbreak, and that is that we have to be prepared for what we can't predict.    So with that in mind, Dr. Frieden, how is our response on Zika, and our continued response on Ebola preparing us for the next emerging threats?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. And how are we assisting our state and local health departments in their preparedness, and certainly their response efforts? What can we do to coordinate the response across all levels of government?    Mr. Tonko. Sure, Dr. Lurie.    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. And it seems as though keeping each one of those independent bodies strong and functioning then provides for a better sense of coordination. And infectious diseases that are threats out there need to be addressed in a way that addresses individual states and individual nations. No one can escape some of those impacts, so I think coordination is important. And the key to containing those infectious diseases is to contain them at their source, I would think. So the coordination here, I agree, is very important.    Mr. Tonko. OK. That's good information to have. And finally, Dr. Frieden, how does our assistance in Latin American countries as they grapple with Zika help keep America safer, Americans safer?    Mr. Tonko. Thank you very much. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
