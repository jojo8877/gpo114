    Mr. Perlmutter. Thanks, Mr. Chair, and I want to thank the panelists for being here today. This is fascinating. And I'm going to ask more general questions, not as specific as some of my colleagues have asked.    And Dr. King, I'd like to start with you. The purpose of these Hubs in my estimation, and as policymakers, we're trying to decide are they working, are they not working, are they doing the kinds of things that you might expect as an experienced scientist and an administrator. Do you see these Hubs as beneficial to the future of this country? And it's going to be that broad, so go for it.    Mr. Perlmutter. Okay. Why?    Mr. Perlmutter. Well, but that's the nature of science too.    Mr. Perlmutter. I mean, if there weren't some errors to go with the trial and errors, you wouldn't be learning much. If you knew the answer before you started, then, you know, what's the point. So----    Mr. Perlmutter. So I appreciate that.    So Dr. Crabtree, my question to you is, how do you determine what the question is, what the mission is, and how do you put the team together?    Mr. Perlmutter. How did you put your team together? How did you determine which industry partners, which academic institutions would be part of your Hub?    Mr. Perlmutter. I mean, if I raised my hand and I said gee, Doctor, I'd like to be part of your team, how do you vet me? I mean, I'm just a lawyer so I wouldn't add much other than I'd try to keep you out of trouble.    Mr. Perlmutter. All right. Good.    Mr. Perlmutter. So Dr. Gehin, how long should these Hubs remain in operation? Is it in perpetuity or is there a finite time period? What do you expect as the administrator of your Hub?    Mr. Perlmutter. Okay. And my time's up. I'll get to you, Dr. Atwater, next go-around, okay? I yield back.    Mr. Perlmutter. No, no, go ahead, because I've got to go downstairs and ask questions----
