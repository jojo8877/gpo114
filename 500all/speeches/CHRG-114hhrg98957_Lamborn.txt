    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    General Klotz, I am going to ask you a single question, also following up on MOX, and then give the rest of my time to Representative Wilson. Regarding the termination, the possible termination of the MOX project, how would that be received by the Russians?    General Klotz. That is a very good question, Congressman, and one of the issues which we have to work through. The Plutonium Management Disposition Agreement says that this plutonium will be disposed of by irradiation or by other means agreed to by the parties. So we can engage in a discussion with the Russians about this particular issue.    In fact, we have already--the Russians came to us earlier in the life of this agreement and asked to change the approach that they were taking, and we agreed to that. In fact, then Secretary of State Clinton and Foreign Minister Lavrov signed an agreement in 2010 which memorialized that.    Now, I think the Secretary of Energy has said this clearly. If not, I will say it. We have been engaged at our level in discussions with our counterparts in Russia about the possibility of this particular approach. They have listened to us very respectfully. Quite frankly, their view is, when you are ready to go forward with this, we will sit down and we will discuss it in more detail. And I suspect, just like it will be on this side of the Atlantic, it will be a whole-of-government approach in Russia to what their final position will be.    But from the technical point of view, the people that we deal with, they fully understand what we are doing, they understand the economics of it, they understand the physics and the chemistry of it, and agree that we have a topic that we can sit down and discuss.    Mr. Lamborn. Okay. Mr. Chairman, I will defer the rest of my time to Representative Wilson.
