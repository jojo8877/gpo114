    Mr. Kline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the courtesy and for the hearing.    I thank the panel of witnesses. You're a terrific, terrific panel of witnesses.    We have been grappling with how do we organize Federal efforts and how do we spend Federal money to good end, and what we've heard for a long time was that industry just couldn't find people with the skills that they needed, they just couldn't find them, and schools were providing skills that weren't needed. And so we went through quite a process here of looking at WIA, the Workforce Act, and we came up with WIOA. I don't know how we actually came up with that name, but we've got a new system.    So, again, all of this was designed, if we're going to put taxpayer money into this, and if we're going to do something to help people who need jobs and to help industries who need workers, it ought to work, it ought to come together and not be working across purposes.    So, Dr. Huftalin, you talked about partnering with local employers, and I think we're seeing evidence of that around the country. What kind of relationship do you have with these workforce development boards? Do you have partners there? Are you part of it? How is that working under the new rules?    Mr. Kline. That's a good report. I like to hear that. But what about the workforce development boards? You go to a one-stop, Salt Lake probably has one, are you connected with that? Somebody goes in there, they are out of a job, they are looking for help, how do they get connected to you, Salt Lake Community College?    Mr. Kline. Yes.    Mr. Kline. Great. Thank you.    Dr. Major, basically the same question. What kind of partnerships does Meridian Tech have with the local workforce development agencies?    Mr. Kline. Okay. Thank you very much.    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
