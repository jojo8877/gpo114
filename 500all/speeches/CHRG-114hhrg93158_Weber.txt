    Mr. Weber. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have been following those events as well, and the gentleman from South Carolina is correct. It seems that the majority, there has been a lot of rockets aimed at Israel. They seem to be going that direction. So those who are crying foul, may indeed be acting the most foul, if I can use that play on words. So I am looking forward to this discussion and see that we do what we can to protect our ally.
