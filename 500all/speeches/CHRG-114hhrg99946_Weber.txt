    Mr. Weber. Thank you, ma'am. This is going to be for Mr. Olson. I guess we will start with you. And I had to step out, so forgive me if this has been answered.    What is the funding gap between what the Afghan Government raises on its own versus what it needs to operate? What other countries are contributing to that Afghan Government in order to close this gap? And what percentage does the U.S. have?    Mr. Weber. The $2 billion they raise, is that for just funding the Afghan forces?    Mr. Weber. Total revenues?    Mr. Weber. Who are those donors?    Mr. Weber. Which is what percentage?    Mr. Weber. Get those for me if you would. There is some discussion, an Afghan official said they need at least $10 billion in donated funds until 2025, at which time according to this, Afghans expect to be self-sufficient. Is this predicated on U.S. troops being there that whole time? And then furthermore, there is discussion that Afghanistan's counternarcotics chief said there would be no eradication efforts in the Hellman Province, which is because of the Taliban's presence, this is their major drug trafficking area, and is that going to impact their ability to be self-sufficient in 2025? Are U.S. troops going to have to be there until 2025?    Mr. Weber. Fair enough. Just get that percentage to me if you would, and I would also like the answer on if they are not going to try to eradicate, I guess that would be the heroin production, in that one province, why not, and what is that going to do to us?    And Madam Chair, I will yield back.
