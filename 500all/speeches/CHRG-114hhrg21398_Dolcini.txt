    Mr. Dolcini. I would be happy to do that, Mr. Bishop. I will work with your staff directly to get more details about the specific payment issues regarding PLC. I think across Georgia and really throughout most of the country, PLC as well as ARC have been very successful Title 1 programs, and the payments made to farmers in your district and farmers all over the Nation have gone out without any significant difficulty.    But I am happy to follow up with your staff to get to the bottom of it.    Mr. Dolcini. Will do.    Mr. Dolcini. I would be happy to do that, Ms. Pingree, and thank you.    The intergenerational transfer rule for dairies in particular was an important part of the farm bill, and I think that that is mostly implemented at this point.    Beyond that, you know, the work that FSA and agencies all across the Department are doing on beginning farmer and rancher issues, I think, are just as important in Maine as they are in California and every other state.    And just using the micro loans, for example, it is sort of the work horse of our farm loan portfolio around the nation. We have made 18,000 of these micro loans in three years. Seventy percent of them have gone to beginning farmers and ranchers. So that is 18,000 American dreams that we are helping fund in your State and in other States.    Mr. Dolcini. And 50 percent of those micro loan recipients are first time customers for the Farm Service Agency. So these are people walking through our doors for the very first time.    We deal with farm storage facility loans, low cost crop insurance. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) does it with their conservation programs. Rural Development does it with its value added business grants. We are really trying to provide the soup to nuts approach to building up the economic wherewithal for beginning farmers and ranchers around the country.    Mr. Dolcini. Well, we look, sir, at rental rates based on statistical information that we receive from NASS, the National Agricultural Statistics Service, and so we typically make those changes every couple of years. Sometimes it varies a little bit, but that is about the timetable.    And I would be happy to come back and visit with you and your staff a little more specifically with regard to what we have done in Iowa.    Mr. Dolcini. That is a good question. I do not know off the top of my head, sir. I will have to get back to you on that.    CRP though in general, I think, has been a very successful program. It has been an important economic tool for farmers to incorporate into their overall practices, and I think we have seen a lot of activity certainly in Iowa and throughout the country with regard to, you know, the various uses of CRP, whether it is continuous programs or general sign-up or some of the other things that we are working with it.    Mr. Dolcini. Perhaps the Economic Research Service (ERS) has done a study. I can certainly look into that and get back to you on that, sir.    Mr. Dolcini. Part of it is the issue that you described and that Mr. Yoder has referenced and other members of the subcommittee in terms of the overall demand on farm loans, both commercial loans as well as loans that are provided by the Farm Service Agency. We have seen a real demand in our direct program, and I think that the budget request reflects the demands that we are seeing in places like the Midwest and Texas and other parts of the nation.    The programs have a very low delinquency rate and a very low default rate. So it is a very good tool for us to use to make sure that folks are taking advantage of the credit safety net that the FSA offers.
