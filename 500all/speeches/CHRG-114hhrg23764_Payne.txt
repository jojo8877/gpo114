    Mr. PAYNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to our ranking member. I apologize for being delayed and I was not here for the commemoration of our colleague, and I would just like to add my sentiments as well.    Mark Takai was a true gentleman and epitomized what a member of Congress should be and he will be sorely missed. And I just knew that he was ill and was going through treatment, but just still been shocked by the rapid demise of our colleague and still shocked by it. But he was a good man and I think that is one of the best things you could say about a person.    Mr. Shoraka, we know the HUBZone programs have had issues around fraud. As we have seen, part of the issue may be the certification process. And, you know, since the certification process depends on documentation submitted by the participant businesses, what does the SBA use to verify the information and documentation they are receiving is indeed authentic? And how can the system be improved to curtail the fraud?    Mr. PAYNE. Okay. So you feel that the issue is .01?    Mr. PAYNE. Oh, sure. I agree. I thought the issue was a little more, a little higher.    Mr. PAYNE. Okay, thank you.    Mr. Shear, very quickly, you have been looking at this program for a number of years now. Why has the program remained to be susceptible to fraud?    Mr. PAYNE. Okay, thank you. My time is expired. But the reason I asked the question is because the Committee has nothing but goodwill towards small businesses. It is our mission. But there are other members that always look for an issue around fraud to curtail the type of work that we are trying to do for small businesses. And with that I yield back.
