    Mr. Flores. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I believe that Mr. Green asked most of my questions so I will pass at this point.    Mr. Flores. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Ms. Ing, you highlighted in your testimony that compact is still learning from the first 3 years of operation.    Will you tell us the most pressing issues that must be addressed by both the commission as well as the State of Texas when you look forward?    Mr. Flores. OK. And the second question for you is this. The WCS site in Andrews County opened in 2012, and it is the only facility that is opened as a result of the low-level waste policy act.    The facility has had some challenges along the way and I was wondering if you could tell us about some of those challenges that the facility has encountered and also how long did it take for the facility to be licensed by the TCEQ?    Mr. Flores. OK.    If you don't mind, if you could ask the facility to give us the time line for the licensing that would helpful.    Mr. Flores. And you can provide that supplementally. Go ahead.    Mr. Flores. I will yield to you.
