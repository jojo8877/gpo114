    Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for providing this opportunity today. I am going to talk about legislation that I have introduced with my colleague and my friend, Congressman Boustany from Louisiana.    Our bill is bipartisan and it is bicameral. It has got more than 85 cosponsors in the House, and it is endorsed by dozens of small businesses and small business organizations across the country. Our bill would allow small businesses with fewer than 50 employees to offer health reimbursement arrangements, HRAs, accounts that employees could use to buy health insurance in the individual market, or to pay for qualified health expenses if they are already covered.    Right now small businesses are subjected to a $100-per-person-per-day fine for offering HRAs to their employees, because an HRA doesn't meet the requirements for group health plans. The businesses that we are talking about don't even have to offer any type of health coverage to their employees. There is no requirement for small companies of 50 or fewer people to provide health insurance. These are businesses that offer HRAs because they are looking for a way to support their workers.    HRAs are a critical retention and attrition tool that puts small businesses that may not have the resources to negotiate employer-sponsored coverage on a level playing field with their larger competitors. We shouldn't be penalizing responsible business owners who are going above and beyond for their employees.    Small businesses drive job creation and grow our economy. We should be going out of our way to help them support their employees and focus on what they do best, running their business.    And this is working. These small businesses are providing health care for their employees. This penalty takes that away from them. And I am proud to join my friend in trying to resolve this issue.    And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
