    Mr. Meadows. Mr. Secretary, since it is down to one question, I have been very keen on not criticizing the ongoing negotiations you have with Iran, so I will ask this one specific question. For over 2\1/2\ years, Pastor Saeed Abedini has been held by Iran. How can we--how can the American people expect that they are going to negotiate in good faith when we can't get an American citizen, a pastor, that really was thrown in the jail----
